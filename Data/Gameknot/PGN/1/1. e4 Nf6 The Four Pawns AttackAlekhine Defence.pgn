1. e4 {1.e4   White starts} Nf6 {1....Nf6  Black starts to tempt his opponent} 2. e5 Nd5 {2.e5 Nd5   White pushes his lone pawn forward Black Knight moves out of the way.  A weaker move by Black is (2...Ne4, 3 d3 Nc5, 3. d4 Na6 4. f4 giving White slight advantage)} 3. d4 {3. d4  pawn moves forward protecting lone pawn} d6 {3. ..... d6  Black can move pawns too} 4. c4 {4. c4 White again threatens Black Knight} Nb6 {4...... Nb6  Knight moves away} 5. f4 {5.f4.... fifth move by White. Four Pawns out, this time re-enforcing e5 pawn.  And Whites options are very great.} dxe5 6. fxe5 {5..... dxe5, 6. fxe5    exchange of centre pawns and now Black has two options to attack the White centre  6....c5 OR 6....Nc6  If first option, then best play and response is considered 6.....c5 7. d5 e6 8. Nc3 exd5 9. cxd5 c4 10. Nf3 Bg4 11. Qd4 bxf3 12 gxf3 Bb4 13 Bxc4  0-0 14 Bh6.... Black's alternative's leave White in advantage (14....gxh6, 14..... Nxc4 14....N8d7)} Nc6 {The second option was played during this game as it gives Black alot more options.  6..... Nc6 } 7. Be3 Bf5 {7. Be3 Bf5   White protects the vunerable d4 pawn and Black responds with some development} 8. Nc3 e6 9. Nf3 {8. Nc3 e6  9. Nf3......  Now again Black has some options in front of him  9...Bb4, 9...Bg4, 9....Qd7 9....Be7 and the one this game followed 9 ...Nb4  (9...Bb4 10 Be2 0-0 11 0-0 Bxc3  12 bxc3 Na5 13 Nd2 Qd7 14 Rf4 Bg6 15 Qf1 c5  White then has (16 Nb3 Qa4 17. Nxc5 Or 16 h4)  (9......Bg4 10 Be2 This simple development move is considered strong ... Bxf3 11 gxf3 Qh4+ 12Bf2 Qf4 13 c5 Nd7 14 Bb5 Be7 15 0-0 Bh4)  (9..... Qd7 10 Be2 rd8 11 Qd2 Nb4 12 0-0 c5 13 d5 exd5 14 cxd5 N6xd5 15 Bb5 Nc6  ( 16 Rad1 Nxc3 17 Qxc3 Qxd1  Black has counter chances) (16 Bg5 tries to exploit the awkard placing of the black pieces)  (9.... Be7 10 d5 ... the sharpest continuation which White hopes to disrupt Black's position ... exd5 11 exd5 Nb4 12 Nd4 Bd7 12 e6 fxe6 14 dxe6 Bc6 15 Qg4 Bh4+  ( 15 ...0-0 is considered weak as 16 0-0-0 Qe8 17 Nf5)  16 g3 Bxh1  17 0-0-0 Qf6 18 gxh4 is considered better but with a complicated game)  there won't be many variations from now on.} Nb4 {9.... Nb4  as promised this is the line the game illustrated took.  Black wants to use his Knights to bear down on Whites defence.  But it can be countered.} 10. Rc1 {10. Rc1 giving protection to the c2 square threatened by Bishop and Knight. } c5 11. Be2 Be7 {10....... c5  11. Be2  Be7   (if 11....cx d4 12 Nxd4 Nc6 (12 ... Bg6 13 a3...)13 0-0 Nd7 14 nxf5 exf5 15 rxf5 g6 16 Rxf7!   OR 11.... Bg4 12 Bg5!?  all options favour White.} 12. O-O {12. 0-0 White finally castling ........} cxd4 {12... cxd4   (if 12....0-0 13 dxc5 Nd7 and White continues to drive back Knights 14 a3 Nc6)} 13. Nxd4 {13. Nxd4 considered better option than the reflex Bxd4} O-O {13...  0-0   Black castles} 14. a3 Nc6 {White goes on the counter-attack 14 a3 Nc6} 15. Nxf5 {15.  Nxf5  Black needed to capture Knight with 15.... exf5 unfortunately.....} Qxd1 {15.....Qxd1  this allowed ......} 16. Nxe7+ {16. Nxe7+ .....} Nxe7 {16.  } 17. Rcxd1 {16...... Nxe7  17. Rcxd1  .... and White has a piece up} Nf5 18. Rf3 Rac8 19. c5 Nd5 {Damage limitation from Black and attacks pieces and pawns as he is behind 17..... Nf5 18 Rf3 Rac8 19 c5 Nd5 White continues the pawn progress annoying Black's position} 20. Nxd5 Nh4 {20. Nxd5 .... White happy to exchange and wittle down Black's defence but again Black is his own worst enemy and plays for a higher piece..... Nh4} 21. Ne7+ {21. Ne7+ forking King and Rook.....} Kh8 22. Nxc8 Nxf3+ {21...Kh8 22. Nxc8 Nxf3+} 23. Bxf3 Rxc8 {23. Bxf3 Rxc8} 24. Bxb7 Rb8 25. c6 {Appropriately, like Whites first five moves, is from a pawn and may have been the deal-breaker for conceding.  24. Bxb7 Rb8  25 c6.....   I hope this was of interest to enthusiasts of both disciplines}
