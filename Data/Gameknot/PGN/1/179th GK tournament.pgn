1. c4 {So, Nathan kicks things off with the English Opening.  And, I'm never sure of how the opponent will answer, especially because I haven't studied this opening as much as with other openings.  The only times I studied was in some annotations, mainly by fiercequeen, who I didn't like at all.  But, I also studied one or two examples from annotations by charleshiggie, whose my favorite annotator.} c5 {The most common response is 1...e5 since it's also known as the Reversed Sicilian.  But, there is nothing wrong with this move.} 2. Nc3 {Meanwhile, Nathan starts developing.} Nc6 {As does black.} 3. e4 {Preparing to develop his Bf1.} Nf6 {And, black continues himself.} 4. g3 {This is a move I like a lot.  As I enjoy fianchettos since it prepares a nice long flank for the B where it covers the more squares, since a fianchetto is usually completed on g2 or b2 where they cover 7 squares.  Although it wouldn't here, but it's a nice concept to keep in mind.} d6 {Preparing to continue developing.} 5. h3 {Preventing 5...Ng4 or 5...Bg4 which could become problematic later on.  But, since there wouldn't be an immediate problem, I would've continued developing with 5.Nf3 or completing the fianchetto with 5.Bg2.} h5 {I don't see the point behind this move and find it to be inaccurate since it doesn't do anything to help black with his development.  Not only that, but it's not a dual purpose move which Ken recommended that I learn about.  And, I have at Chess Polgar University.  That's as it sounds with a move for more then one purpose like attacking but to do more then gain tempo.  Like using to get development in the center, for example.} 6. Bg2 {But, Nathan, on the other hand, is thinking along the same lines as me.  And, it's not even because he completed the fianchetto, but Nathan has developed it.  } Be6 {Black, however, is catching up.} 7. d3 {Opening up a line for his Bc1.  As white, I would've played a double fianchetto with 7.b2  But, I think that Nathan made the right decision because in the KID, kenneth_fiore_3 said that double fianchetto's are, generally, not wise.  I saw how it was starting to crumble apart when I did that and still won due to my students lack of development.  But, think that this also applies to any openings.} Qc7 {?! I'm not sure why black played this since I, originally, thought that he was preparing to castle long.  But, that's not so since he won't do that.  Having said that, this was not a wise choice since black hasn't completed his development.  And, this was not one of those times where the Q needed to be brought out this early to prevent loss of material or a dangerous check, either.  Consequently, Nathan will punish him by harassing the Q, in the exact same way that I would've done it.} 8. Nb5 Qb6 9. Be3 {? This is also what I would've done since Nathan's development is almost complete.  However, this will cost him a pawn, as we're about to see.  } a6 10. Nc3 Qxb2 11. Nge2 {But, this is a dual purpose move since it protects the Nc3 while enabling Nathan to complete his development.  I, on other hand, would've gone right on the offense with 11.Na4, but I like this move even better for the reason outlined in the previous example.  I saw a very similar example of this in Susan Polgar's recent lecture with a game in the 1800's where someone defended a N with the other N.  And, it was also on e2.} Nd4 {? Trying to trick Nathan into exchanging N for B since the Be3 is more active and mobile.  This, however, is a mistake as Nathan will win back a pawn.} 12. Rb1 {And, he does so by attacking the Q.  In addition, Nathan will exchange but not in the way that black expects since white will do so with his less active N for black's more active N, instead.  So, it was in the complete opposite way then what white expected, and it'll favor him since he'll also win back a pawn, as noted above.} Qa3 13. Nxd4 cxd4 14. Bxd4 b5 {Attacking c4 a second time, but Nathan is ready since he'll counterattack on the next move.} 15. Rb3 Qa5 16. e5 {! This is an even better move then Nathan could've anticipated.  He just wanted to gain time by attacking the N, but this is also a masked battery due to a discovered attack on black's Ra1.  This should win, at the very least, the exchange.} dxe5 17. Bxe5 {Having said that, I understand why Nathan played this since it defends.  But, best, however, was 17.Bxa8 winning the R for B with advantage to white.  I remember something like that popping up in a couple of my games, even against jstevens1 who's now, I believe, jotheblackqueen.  By playing this, however, black will go after Nathan's R, so that Bxa8 just leads to an even exchange.} bxc4 18. dxc4 {?? This, however, was a serious blunder by Nathan.  Much better would've been to exchange with 18.Bxa8  I'm sure that it wasn't white's intention to exchange, but this move is going to cost him a piece, even if white were to take on a8 on his next move since nothing is stopping ...Qxe5+  Before doing so, black takes on c4 first to win an additional pawn, leaving him more then just a piece up.} Bxc4 19. Rb2 Qxe5+ 20. Ne2 {Nathan made the right choice by interposing as it leaves the option of castling open, without losing any more material.  But, black has other ideas since he's about to attack the Q.} Rd8 21. Qc2 Bxe2 {Thinking that this wins more material, but Nathan has ways out of it, starting with his next move.} 22. Qc6+ {I would've just taken with 22.Qxe2, but I think that this was best.  With the deficit, Nathan isn't forced to liquidate further since it will enable him to win back a piece.} Nd7 23. Rxe2 Qa1+ {Of course, black is going to win something else, but it's a pawn, as opposed to, another piece.  However, black is still winning but needs to start being careful.  As the idea is, "When you think that you have won or are in a winning position, be very careful, and do not underestimate your opponent.  Otherwise, you might start making mistakes and losing the game."  As easy as it is to become optimistic for black, Jack's statement, as with my game against anitam, is about to become a reality here.} 24. Kd2 Qxa2+ 25. Kd3 Qb3+ {Although, if we were to go to the other side, I'd also feel optimistic as white.} 26. Kd4 {Having said that, I would've played 26.Kd2, in hopes that black would play 26...Qa2+ again or maybe 26...Qb2.  But, similar to my last tournament game, my idea of a good time would be trying to trick black so that through a series of him checking, and white moving the K; the same position would repeat 3 times, allowing for a draw by repetition.} e5+ {? I think, however, that black might be worried about the same thing, so he checks this way.  Although it looks good, similar to what I just studied with Susan Polgar, in the 1800 game, this is a similar mistake.  While it looks like black can do damage, the same piece that looks dangerous is directly pinned which is very similar to what happened in the other game.  Having said that, Nathan is about to win back a pawn, and then some, as he'll have other things to worry about.  As noted on black's 23rd, this is where he starts to underestimate Nathan.} 27. Rxe5+ Be7 28. Rhe1 {After having the last move forced, Nathan doubles up, as things are, suddenly, looking very bad for black.} Qb4+ {Doing what he ca to put an end to the threat, he plays this, and then checks again.} 29. Kd3 Qb3+ 30. Ke2 f6 {Not surprisingly, black wants Nathan's R out of there.  Instead of 31.Re6 which Nathan does, I would've counterattacked with 31.Bd5  But, I see why white didn't play that since keeping both R's on one file is a very good strategy.} 31. Re6 Qa2+ {?? Still trying to reduce the damage, but this only helps white even more.  In fact, this is the losing move for black because of what happens when Nathan moves his K back.  As now, both R's will be united on the same file, and combined with the Q, the R's are about to be too much for black to handle.  And, it starts with Nathan winning back a piece since blacks Be7 is still pinned.  Better would've been 31...Qb8 where the Q is still in action.  And, that way, if something like 32.Kf1 to reunite the R's, black could try to answer the threat with something like 32...Qc8 where, being ahead, he's threatening to liquidate Q's and keeping things difficult for white.} 32. Kf1 a5 33. Re6xe7+ Kf8 34. Bd5 {But, it gets worse.  As now, black must give up his Q to avoid mate without anything in return.  And, the reason being is because after something like 34...Qxd5 35.Qxd5, the Nd7 is indirectly pinned which might not seem bad.  But, keeping the R safe means losing the N since there'll be 2 attackers against one defender on the d7 and d8 squares.  With that being said, I'd resign right here.} Qa3 {With what I posted above, it's now mate in 2 starting with Nathan's next move.  It might seem like black can do something, but similar to my game against bhidragon, black's Q is out of play.  So, it cannot come back to rescue the K like you'd see in other positions.} 35. Qe6 Qxe7 36. Qxe7# {Overall, both sides made mistakes, but it was interesting to watch.  Black had the advantage, but like me against anitam and l-d-j against me he became overly confident and underestimated Nathan.  In doing so, white was able to pull a swindle and win this game.}
