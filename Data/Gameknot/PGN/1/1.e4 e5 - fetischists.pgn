[Opening "Petrov (C42), Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {     Here is a recent Petroff from a symmetrical king pawn mini-tournament.  It has solid positional advice for aspiring players, along with a sacrificial ending for those of you who are looking for a show.      The lesson here is to always have a plan.  Here, Black drifts aimlessly, letting White accumulate small advantages and cash them in at my leisure.  This culminates in a mating attack on the Black king and a forced mate in 5.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {The Russian or Petroff is a popular opening at high levels, Kramnik using it to win the first game of the 2004 world championship match against Leko.} 3. Nxe5 d6 {3...Nxe4 loses a pawn after 4. Qe2, and after 3...Qe7 4. d4 d6 5. Nf3 Nxe4, White plays 6. Be2 and 0-0 and the Black queen is misplaced.} 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nf6 {Solid but not as sharp as 5...Nxc3.  Perhaps there is a second lesson here, avoid passivity at all costs.} 6. d4 d5 {6...Be7 is another way to play.} 7. Bd3 {White has a clear lead in development.} Bb4 {Here, 7...Be7 is to be preferred.  The "threat" of doubled pawns is fine for White, as I can advance them to attack the Black center.} 8. O-O O-O 9. Bg5 {This pin, however, has some sting.} c6 {Necessary to avoid the loss of the d-pawn.} 10. Qd2 {White is clearly better here, being three tempi ahead in development, with a clear plan of kicking the b4 bishop, dropping a knight on e5 and playing Rae1 and prepare f4, with a kingside attack.  Black has to find a place for his queen's knight and for his light-squared bishop and White's only weakness, e4, is well guarded.} Bg4 {Perhaps 10...Nbd7, preparing play on the queenside.} 11. Ne5 {Centralization of the knight with tempo.} Be6 12. a3 Be7 {White gains yet another tempo, however, the Black position is solid.  The advantage in development will evaporate if I play passively.  Typically, the best way to use an advantage in development is to translate this into a weakness in your opponents camp.  Once the advantages are swapped, then White retains his solidity of position, but with attacking chances.} 13. Rae1 Nbd7 14. f4 {Black has finally developed, but White is able to attack first.  The immediate threat being, f5.} Nxe5 {Black gets to exchange some pieces here, but the pawn wedge at e5 is a tremendous attacking advantage and inhibits Black's piece mobility.} 15. fxe5 Nd7 16. Bxe7 Qxe7 {Eliminating Black's good but passive bishop for White's bad but active bishop.  White retains all the attacking chances in the position.  All that remains is to bring in all of the pieces to apply pressure.} 17. Ne2 {The knight wants to go to f4 or f5 via g3.} c5 {Not so sure about this move, as this gives the knight a nice square on d4.} 18. c3 {Hoping Black will clear the d4-square for the knight by capturing.  Then ...Nc5 could be met with Bb1 and the c-file is only half-open for a Black rook.} Rfc8 {This looks like a mistake.  Not only moving a key defender from your king, but the c-file is not opening as specified in the previous note.} 19. Qf4 {Maneuvering a key piece into attack formation.} Nf8 {...c4 stops me from bringing in the knight, but only delays the inevitable attack.} 20. dxc5 Qxc5+ 21. Nd4 {The check only facilitates the build-up of my army to their best squares.  Now I need a rook and the attack will inevitably crash through.} Qb6 22. Rf2 {Patiently defending.} Ng6 23. Bxg6 {Removing a defender and opening a file for my heavy pieces.} hxg6 24. Re3 {The rook will come to g3 and the h-pawn will become the battering ram.} a6 25. Rg3 Rcf8 26. h4 Rae8 {Black's army is now positioned for the defense, but its too late.} 27. Rg5 {Preparing Qg3 and h5, with a winning attack.} f6 {The first huge mistake.  The g-file will now be the bullet in the gun.} 28. Rxg6 Bf7 {Mate in 5.} 29. Rxg7+ Kxg7 30. Nf5+ Kg8 31. Qh6 {Mate is unavoidable on g7.} Bg6 32. Qg7# {Would have been a mate in five as Black had ...Qxf2 , postponing mate one more move.}
