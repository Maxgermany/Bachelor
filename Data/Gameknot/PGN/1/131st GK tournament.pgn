[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening. bits_pilani was the opponent with the highest rating played against, the difference was about 400 Elo-points. And it was at the 131st GK tournament in the intermediate section.} d5 {Queen's pawn opening.} 2. Nf3 Bf5 3. Bf4 {That position isn't not very rare, is it?} e6 4. e3 Bd6 5. Bd3 {This position is still equal.} Bxf4 6. exf4 {The bishops on the black fields are out of the game} Ne7 7. Nc3 O-O 8. O-O Nd7 9. Ne5 Nxe5 10. fxe5 f6 11. Re1 c6 12. Re3 {That move was the preparation of my first mistake, but this position is still equal.} fxe5 13. dxe5 {That was the mistake because you can play d4 with the attack to the knight at c3 and the rook at e3. It could be better If I played Rxe5 instead, because then after d4 only the knight would be attacked.} d4 14. Bxf5 dxe3 15. Bxe6+ {At this position I think was still a chance to bring the game into a draw.} Kh8 16. fxe3 Qa5 17. Qd6 Ng6 18. Rf1 Rxf1+ 19. Kxf1 Rd8 20. Bf7 {That is a blunder of me, now I was losing this match because I lost lots of material (see the further moves)} Rxd6 21. exd6 Qf5+ {I have lost another bishop so I decided to resign. But I am trying to win against opponents  with an rating of 1800 or higher. I have to look after ways to do it. But it was a good game!}
