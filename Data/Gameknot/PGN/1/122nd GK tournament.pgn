[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner,Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {I haven't played against many knight openers, but I suppose the theory is the same. Develop and attack center.  Dunst opening (just looked it up on GK database haha)...anyway apparently this is a pretty common opening.} e5 {Getting boldly into the action! East or west, pawn power is the best!} 2. e4 {White really likes the d5 square I guess. When someone's so focused on a square...} Nf6 {...I go for it too :P  Developing knight, attacking d5 and e4 (kinda)} 3. Bd3 {I believe this was a slight blunder in that it blocks the d2 pawn which delays white's LSB from entering the battle, and at this point the e4 pawn didn't really need any backup besides the knight at c3. Perhaps c4 would've been a better development.} Bc5 {Now that white didn't focus on the d5 square, I continue developing the DSB.} 4. Nd5 {This threw me off guard for a moment. I was expecting white to continue developing his/her pieces. This was perhaps to threaten the knight on f6 and open the c file for the c2 pawn.  This move is not available in the database. Up to this point the opening was called "Dunst (Sleipner,Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"} c6 {Trying to remove the d5 knight from an attacking position} 5. Ne3 {Refused to exchange, at this point I can't tell if this or c3 would've been better. From c3, the knight would've backed up the e4 pawn...} d5 {...for this very reason. attacking the e4 pawn while opening the LSB for action} 6. Qf3 {Backing up the e4 pawn. I still think white should've focused on development of the g1 knight and c1 bishop, probably after pawn exchanges at this point.} O-O {Bringing the rook into action} 7. exd5 {Pawn exchange ahoy!} cxd5 {Dog eat dog!} 8. Qe2 {Another loss of development. Not sure why this move was made. Maybe to mobilize the LSB towards black's queenside?} Nc6 {Bringing the knight into action. More attack towards the center.} 9. Bb5 {Exchanging the bishop for knight?} a6 {Forcing white's LSB to exchange or retreat} 10. Bxc6 {And he/she decides to exchange.} bxc6 {Getting material back.  Okay, after 10 moves. Black controls the middle, castled king, and most of his pieces are developed or available for instant development. White has no pawn development, 1 active knight, 4 inactive pieces with locked bishop and rooks. So in short, white is screwed :P} 11. h3 {Prevents black from moving knight or LSB to g4.} Rb8 {Claiming the open file} 12. g4 {Not quite sure why this move was made. Maybe pushing pawns toward the castle.} Ne4 {I don't remember why I made this move either. Maybe I was thinking of getting Queen toward White's kingside} 13. b3 {Setting up for c pawn to c4 perhaps...} d4 14. Ng2 {Pushing the pawns forward...perhaps knight to c4 would've been a better and more aggressive position for white} Re8 {...and I completely didn't see the undefended knight} 15. Qxe4 {...but White saw it. I made blunders too duh...lol  Moving on :P} Bb7 {I guess I was hoping to somehow move the c6 pawn soon to attack the a8-h1 diagonal} 16. d3 {Opens up the diagonal for the DSB} Be7 {Yes, this is a totally useless move I intended to trick white with...} 17. Qxe5 {...and succeeded...haha sometimes I amaze myself with my stupidity turning into good moves} Bb4+ {Discovered check on the Queen} 18. Kd1 {One of a few forced moves} Rxe5 {So taking no risks while claiming the e file} 19. Bf4 {attacking both rooks, so Black loses one either way} Re1+ {Since I'm losing a rook anyway I try to develop a better position} 20. Nxe1 {Forced!} Qe7 {Keeping mate pressure on e1} 21. Bd2 {Preventing the e1 mate by blocking Black's DSB} Re8 {Threatening e1 mate again by 22... Qxe1+, 23. Bxe1 Rxe1!} 22. Ng2 {Hate them pesky knights} c5 {Trying to remove the backup on e1 from the g2 knight} 23. h4 {...This move again took me by surprise. It took me a while to realize that by making that move white gave me the game} Bxg2 {Removing the e1 defense} 24. Rh2 {White didn't see the impending doom!} Qe1+ {Impending doom (ish)!} 25. Bxe1 {Only move!} Rxe1# {Impending doom! muhahaha  lol Thanks for reading! Please comment on any blunders I missed (which I'm sure are abundantly available here). Constructive comments are highly appreciated.  Special thanks to vmburger for this great game!}
