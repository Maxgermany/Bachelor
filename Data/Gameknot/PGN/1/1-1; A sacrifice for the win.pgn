1. f4 {This is my third game against thehelllion. Game 1; I win due to a blunder that cost him a bishop. Game 2; helllion wins due to a blunder that cost me a queen (this game has already been annotated). This is game 3, where Black falls for a pawn fork which does more than just put White up in material, as I sac a bishop for the win (though to be honest, this may not be so spectacular for the higher-rated players, but it isn't often that  I sacrifice to win a game :) )...I start out with the Bird opening - not one that I've tried a lot.} d5 {Black takes an immediate claim to the centre} 2. e3 {supporting the f-pawn, and opening up diagonals for both White's queen and bishop} Nf6 {Black develops his King-side knight...} 3. Nf3 {and White does likewise. So far this is remaining true to the GK database; White has a knight and pawn pressuring e5; Black has a knight and pawn pressuring e4 (though I'm not sure if that's the purpose of this opening)} Bf5 {?! I have no idea what Black's planning here - I guess to play Bxc2 should White move his Queen. This game is now out of the GK database, though checking the world database there are 30 games that have reached this position (this is me checking it after the game, btw)} 4. b3 {preparing to fianchetto Queenside and develop my pieces for castling - I'm planning a future kingside assault due to Black's f5 bishop} e6 {opens up a path for Black's dark-square bishop} 5. Bb2 {I don't realise it at the time, but this move helps me pull off a win later in the game. Right now, it's just another normal developing move} Be7 {opens up castling opportunities, while keeping his bishop in a secure spot.} 6. Nc3 {I develop my second knight, and am one move away from castling queenside.... (I also note that this move is out of all databases now)} O-O {white Black castles kingside} 7. Qe2 {It does look, at first glance, that I've just left the c2 pawn exposed, ready for the white bishop to snatch it, but that would be a big mistake due to 8. d3!, winning the bishop} c5 {!? Black's b and c pawns look like a potential threat to White's queenside. I could castle now....} 8. d3 {but I want to secure my position slightly before castling. The pawn on d3 prevents the two pawns for being much of a threat for now} Na6 {?! perhaps hoping to land the knight on c5 after 9...c4, maybe?} 9. O-O-O {White finally castles, and secures its king.} Rc8 {further support for the c-pawn, but right now White has enough defence to not have to worry about this right now} 10. h3 {White starts an attack on the kingside now - the main reason why he didn't castle kingside} Nh5 {!? a sneaky trap from Black, but it might not have worked out as well as it first looked - If White were to immediately strike out with 11. g4, then Black plays Ng3, forking queen and rook, but then again, what if; 12. Qg2 Nxh1 13.gxf5 and the knight, who has nowhere to run to, is lost, and White gains in material advantage... but Black gets two free moves after gxf5 and after Qxh1 to counter-attack with tempo (for example, d4 maybe?)} 11. Qf2 {I don't want the fork, however, and Black is now about to be forced to retreat both his bishop and knight...} Qc7 {? Which Black completely overlooks! maybe Black only saw the fork when he played Nh5?} 12. g4 {! of course - why not?} Nxf4 {Black chooses to save his knight and to obtain a pawn from it as well.} 13. gxf5 {I eventually decide on the bishop here, opening up my g-file for the rook} Nh5 {Forced; there isn't anywhere else that Black's knight can go} 14. Rg1 {grabbing the g-file for my rook} exf5 {this was a mistake from Black, which allows me to position my knight on a strong square...} 15. Nxd5 {with one more added benefit of oprning up the long diagonal for my dsb. There's a real danger in that bishop, but right now Black has to focus on defending his queen. There are three squares in which the queen can do that and protect the bishop as well...} Qd7 {the queen is safe, but now White's about to break open Black's defence...} 16. Bxg7 {! with a bishop sacrifice! The bishop has to be taken, because any other moves leads to 17.Bh6+ Ng7 (...Kh8? Qd2! gets there quicker) 18.Bxh7 Rd8 19.Bh6+ Kh8 20.Qg2 and then mate next move} Nxg7 {but then again..} 17. Qg2 {Now there's no stopping mate! (I guess that made this game won for White at move 16)} Kh8 {the only thing Black could try here was Bg5, where he hopes White slips up and capture with the knight, then 18...f6 keeps Black in the game. Of course, should White recapture with the queen, there'd still be no hope...} 18. Qxg7# {and the game is finished! good game!}
