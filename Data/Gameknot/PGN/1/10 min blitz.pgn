[Opening "Sicilian (B33), Pelikan (Lasker/Sveshnikov) variation"]

1. e4 {Best by test} c5 {sicilian defense} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {open sicilian} cxd4 4. Nxd4 {standard stuff} Nf6 {Other moves are g6, e6, d6, but those moves may be played later.} 5. Nc3 {defends e4} e6 {And so we have this variation. Its not the most common variation in the sicilian.} 6. Bg5 {This is out of book, usually Ndb5 is played. } Be7 {The computer likes this move though d6 is played much more.} 7. Qd2 {Getting ready to castle queenside and try to march with the kingside pawns. Here black can play an interesting tactic 7 ... Nxe4 8 Nxe4 Bxg5 9Nxg5 Nxd4 and black wins a pawn. We would then already be near the endgame.} h6 {attacks the bishop.} 8. Be3 {I decide to take the bishop back.} Bb4 {Maybe better is Ng4 and trade the knight for a bishop. That would probably be my move. This puts pressure on the e4, because after the trade on c3 its undefended.} 9. Bd3 {Im thinking that tempo is everything here so I use the bishop here to protect the pawn.} Ne5 {Still I like Ng4 more. But this is ok. But it doesn't threat anything serious yet. At least, I could not spot it.} 10. f4 {Tempo is everything, I already decide to move the kingside pawn with a bit of tempo.} Nxd3+ {Black takes my bishop with check.} 11. Qxd3 {Queen takes.} O-O {I was afraid black would play 11. ... Bxc3 in which case I would recapture with the pawn or else I lose the pawn on e4.} 12. e5 {Advancing the pawn, this move stops the knight standing on f6, which is always the key feature of the defense on the kingside.} Nd5 {Nd5 threathening to double the pawns on the c-file.} 13. O-O {I decide to castle to get out of the nasty pin.} d6 {Im happy with this move. I dont really see what it does. Probably better is just take on c3 to get nasty double pawns and try to attack it with Qc7 maybe?} 14. Ne4 {I want to keep the piece on the board and now its on a good square.} Bd7 {Black is still trying to develop since he has delayed it a bit.} 15. Rf3 {Rf3 pretty much singals the start of a kingside advance.} a6 {Probably to play Bb5 later on and give the bishop a nice square.} 16. g4 {I decide to dont waste any time and start the pawn advancement.} Bc5 {Pins some pieces to the king.} 17. g5 {I advance further.} Nxe3 {trading off. I don't really mind, the black bishop is not really valuable to me. Black now has the bishop pair though.} 18. Rxe3 {Take it with the rook.} hxg5 {Nice move, now if i play fxg5, then dxe5 loses the exchange.} 19. Rh3 {My attention is still on the kingside.} Bxd4+ {This would be losing if it wasn't with check! Im threathening Nf6+ and after gxf6 I win with Qh7#, or black has to give away the queen. But the threat is still there.} 20. Kg2 {This seemed to be a good option. Kf1 loses to Bb5 and Nf2 loses to Bxf2, Kxf2 g6.} Bc6 {Now my knight is pinned! another good move by black.} 21. Qxd4 {Didn't really know what to play here, so I decided to trade pieces.} gxf4 {gxf4, my knight is still pinned.} 22. Kf1 {unpinning the knight. I am two pawns down but material may not matter too much. I don't want to go to an endgame.} Bxe4 {Black trades, he probably does want an endgame since he is two pawns ahead.} 23. Qxe4 {queen takes.} g6 {The threat Qh7# was there but I think I like f5 more. } 24. Qxf4 {Qxf4 I'm still threathening stuff. Black took some time to figure the next move.} f5 {f5 Frees up the king.} 25. Qh6 {I'm going to attack the kingside. Was there anything better?} Kf7 {Foced since I threathened Qh7# again.} 26. Qh7+ {check} Ke8 {forced} 27. Qxg6+ {check, I'm even now in material.} Kd7 {Forced, sort of. Rf7 loses to Rh8+} 28. Rh7+ {check} Kc6 {Kc8 doesn't look to good. The pawn on e5 may be a very good piece if he played that.} 29. Qxe6 {Keeping the tension.} Re8 {This is too slow, but I don't know if black has any good move at all.} 30. Qc4+ {check} Kb6 {forced.} 31. Qb4+ {check} Kc6 {forced. Ka7 Qxb7#} 32. Qxb7+ {check.} Kc5 {Kc5.} 33. b4+ {trying to find a mating net. Simply Rc7+ may have worked too. Yes, I think that is better.} Kd4 {to the open field!} 34. Rd1+ {bringing up another piece.} Kxe5 {taking the pawn.} 35. Qd5+ {check!} Kf4 {good move. I think.} 36. Rd4+ {check.} Re4 {good block.} 37. Rh4+ {Here I calculated Kg5 Rxe4 and the pawn is pinned.} Qxh4 {But it was a blunder!} 38. Qxd6+ {check! Kg5 saves the day for black. He would probably have won. Even Kg4 too.} Ke3 {Black counterblunders!} 39. Rd3# {Checkmate. I appreciate any comments. Thanks for watching.}
