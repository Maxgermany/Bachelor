1. e4 {We start in a book position. Before I start, I would like to say a little background info on this game. It was the second round of the 121 GK tournament in Casual. It was also one of the only 2 games I actually checkmated, the others I won on time. I will make one on the other game when I finish it} e5 {I continue in a book, I seem to do the kings pawn a lot.} 2. Nf3 {It comes out} Nc6 3. c4 {ouch. I hate when people do that move on me. It is very annoying.} Nf6 4. Bd3 Bc5 {An attack like any other. Who would have known that that would give me the win?} 5. O-O {First error. Looks good though, it becomes an error when vickigrandma messes up.} Ng4 {The start...} 6. h3 Nf6 {...or not :'(} 7. a3 O-O 8. Ra2 {What? If you understand that move, tell me in the comments.} Nd4 {The attack starts.} 9. Nxe5 {Or not.} Re8 {Or does it?} 10. Ng4 {No...} Nxe4 {Yes!!!! Well, more like an attempt to capture a piece.} 11. f3 {That becomes a mate in 2!!!!! What a blunder! Here I put in a conditional move.} Nxf3+ {And sadly...} 12. Kh1 {A } Ng3# {Mate! In "121st GK tournament part 2 will vickigrandma continue", you will find my second game against Vickigrandma!}
