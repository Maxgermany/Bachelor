[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Mokele Mbembe (Buecker) variation"]

1. e4 Nf6 {This is the Alkehine's defense (spelling?)} 2. e5 {Most common} Ne4 3. d4 e6 4. Bd3 {Develops with tempo} Ng5 {It jumps out of the way} 5. Nf3 {I add another attacker forcing him to exchange and developing my queen} Nxf3+ 6. Qxf3 f6 {Trying to attack my pawn center but better might have been d6} 7. exf6 {Would it have been better to let him capture first?} Qxf6 8. Qxf6 gxf6 {And by move eight the queens are traded off} 9. Nc3 Bb4 10. Bd2 {I complete my minor piece development} Bxc3 11. Bxc3 d5 12. O-O-O {With the queens off the board and a fair amount of material exchanged, I though my king would be better nearer the center.} Rg8 13. Bxh7 {Pawn trade} Rxg2 14. Rhg1 {? This loses another pawn} Rxh2 15. Rg8+ Kd7 16. Rd2 {?? And this is the blunder where I lose my bishop.} Rxh7 {He takes it and I am behind be four but he doesn't have any of his queenside pieces out so I don't resign.} 17. f4 b6 {Preparing to develop the bishop} 18. Bb4 {I played this because it was a lot more active here than on c3} Nc6 {Development} 19. Ba3 Bb7 20. Rdg2 {I noticed the discovered attack and defended my rook but better would have been trading as this loses a pawn} Nxd4 21. Rg2g7+ Rxg7 22. Rxg7+ {Probably a bad exchange as I am behind} Kc6 23. Kd2 {Centralizing my king} Nf5 24. Rf7 d4 25. Rxf6 {Now I'm only down four} Re8 26. Kd3 Ba6+ 27. Ke4 Bc4 28. b3 Bd5+ 29. Ke5 a5 30. Bb2 {Trying to win a pawn} Kc5 31. a4 Ne3 {?? This loses the knight and a pawn} 32. Bxd4+ Kb4 33. Bxe3 Kc3 {The score is tied but it's only a matter of time before the BK picks of my pawns} 34. f5 exf5+ {Skewers my king and bishop, but I can take his bishop} 35. Kxd5 {So I do} Rxe3 36. Rxf5 Kxc2 {And now he starts picking off my pawns} 37. Kc6 {Going for his} Rxb3 {One left} 38. Kxc7 Rb4 39. Rf6 b5 {This forces the survival of one pawn} 40. axb5 Rxb5 41. Ra6 Kb3 42. Kc6 {I keep playing hoping he'll make a mistake} Kb4 43. Ra7 a4 44. Ra6 {Just shuffling back and forth because I can't see anything better to do} Rc5+ 45. Kb6 Rb5+ 46. Ka7 {?? This loses the game. I should have moved back to c6 and hoped for a draw by repetition, but this lets him force a rook trade.} Ra5 {And I resign because after the trade I can't stop him from promoting. As always, please comment if you see something that I didn't mention.}
