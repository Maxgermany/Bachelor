[Opening "Sicilian (B92), Najdorf, Opovcensky variation"]

1. e4 c5 {The Sicilian Defence. Some people's favourite opening, and statistically the most common reply to 1.e4. I just happen to never play it, as I usually prefer the French Defence.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Main line Sicilian.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {This move initiates the Sicilian Najdorf, a variation of the Sicilian with numerous lines. My favourite of these is the sharp Poisoned Pawn Variation but that is beside the point.} 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O {!?!?!? This move surprises me. Either an immensely cunning sacrifice or a blunder. Taking the players' ratings into consideration this is probably an immensely cunning sacrifice.} exd4 8. Qxd4 Nc6 9. Qd1 Be6 {As yet, White appears to have gained nothing from the apparent sacrifice.} 10. f4 Be7 11. Be3 Rc8 12. Bf3 Na5 13. Bd4 O-O 14. Qd2 Nc4 {Both sides are developing as quickly as possible and trying to find and gain footholds.} 15. Qf2 b5 16. b3 Na3 17. Rac1 Bg4 18. Kh1 Bxf3 19. gxf3 {I wonder what was wrong with 19.Qxf3. White has now exposed his king. And by now I think we must assume that the knight sacrifice WAS a blunder.} b4 20. Na4 Nb5 21. c4 bxc3 e.p. 22. Nxc3 Nxd4 23. Qxd4 {Black just needs to exchange all White's pieces off to consolidate his lead.} Qa5 24. Rfg1 g6 25. f5 Rc7 26. fxg6 hxg6 27. Na4 Rxc1 28. Rxc1 {White is being forced into passivity, which increases his ever-growing disadvantage.} Qh5 29. Qf2 d5 30. exd5 Nxd5 {And White resigns.}
