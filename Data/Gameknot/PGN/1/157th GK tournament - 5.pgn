1. e4 {Round 2 of a tournament.  I'd been on a great streak lately but it's cooled off a little.  My opponent from Serbia chose some type of accelerated Sicilian that resembled a centre attack so I looked through a few of his past games.  Apparently he loves swinging his Q around.  It gives him a lot of tactical options once he gets a few other pieces out.  He played well.  He scored 6.0 in Round #1 Intermediate.  Not sure how he moved up to Advanced but good on him!  As for myself, I shouldn't have lost this game.  I let him get his Q in my face and then I goofed a few tactics by not pulling the trigger quicker e.g. 22.Bg7.  Lesson learned.  Keep the N & B away with the old a3 or h3 trick. } c5 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 Qh5 5. Be2 {Develops a piece and lines up a discovered attack on his Q.  Computer claims I'm already up +1.68 but I can't see it.} Bg4 6. h3 {I just wanted to relieve a bit of pressure but the computer doesn't like it at all.  Maybe because I can't immediately capture the B on account of his Q would snatch my K-side R.  Anyway, I don't like the computer's recommendation of Nb5, although the simple O-O makes sense.  Funny that I ended up castling Q-side.} Bxf3 7. Bxf3 Qe5+ 8. Be2 e6 9. d3 Nc6 10. Be3 g5 {This could be fun if he throws his pawns at my K-side.} 11. Qd2 Nge7 {Weird move.  ...Be7 would be better I think.  He eventually puts that N on g6 which works out pretty good for him.  Both N's end up putting advanced pressure on me.} 12. O-O-O Bg7 13. Bxg5 Ng6 14. Rde1 {This never lead to anything and in hindsight a3 would have been useful later on.  If only I could predict the future lol because I'm trying to get away from slow, defensive moves like a3.} c4 {Don't really see the point of this although my response just ends up throwing my d-pawn away.  This further proves his aggressive style of attacking play.} 15. dxc4 Qa5 {The start of a bad thing for me.  Gotta study this more because I thought I was still OK.} 16. Bh6 Rd8 17. Bd3 Bxc3 18. Qxc3 Nb4 {Now I see why he played 17...Bxc3.  He now has a lot of tactical options.} 19. Qb3 Ne5 20. Be4 {It's the difference between occupying a square and controlling a square.  I couldn't defend it on d3.} Nxa2+ 21. Kb1 Nb4 22. c3 {My note during the game: "22.c3 get rid of that N then get back to my DSB".  But computer has me playing the immediate Bg7 (+6.81).  In fact, when I finally do play Bg7 at move 24 it's way too late and the computer swings the advantage back to black.} Nbd3 23. Bxd3 Nxd3 24. Bg7 Rg8 25. Bf6 Rd7 26. Re2 {Computer says ? on account of 26...Qf5 setting up a double attack on my DSB and f-pawn, with the addition of a discovered attack by the same Q on my K through his N which is also threatening 2 of my pawns.  Holy tactics batman!!  Computer calls for 26.Re3-Rf3 which I never would have seen.  I'm only human.} Qf5 27. Bh4 Nxf2+ {}
