1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit. } e6 {Queen's Gambit Declined. } 3. Nc3 c5 {Nf6 is the more typical response.} 4. cxd5 exd5 5. dxc5 Bxc5 6. e3 h5 7. Be2 Qh4 {The queen was the only piece protecting Pd5.  Nf6 might have been better.  Black has good control of the center, strengthening that is usually a good idea. } 8. g3 Qb4 9. Qc2 d4 10. a3 Qb6 11. Ne4 {White threatens Bc5.  Nd7 would counter.  But Pb4 would give white a bishop.  Black is in trouble.} Bb4+ 12. axb4 Qxb4+ 13. Bd2 Qb6 14. Nf3 dxe3 15. Bxe3 Qa5+ {Qb4+ would have been safer, followed by Qe7 to defend against white playing QxBc8+.  Because white would probably interpose the bishop.  But Qe7 attacks Ne4, giving black momentum.} 16. Rxa5 b6 {Nope.  Nc6 lets the rook defend against QxBc8+, while the knight defends Pa7, threatened by white's bishop and rook. } 17. Qxc8+ {Forced mate.} Ke7 18. Re5# {}
