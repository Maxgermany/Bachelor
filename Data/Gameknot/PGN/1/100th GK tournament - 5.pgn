[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 d5 {Here we have the Scandinavian defence. This defence is somewhat dubious as it gets the queen out early but there is no refutation to this so it's fine for black.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 {Develops the knight with tempo} Qa5 {This is arguably the best square the queen go to. The other variation is where the queen moves to d6 which does not accomplish much.} 4. Bc4 {Strikes the weak f7 square. 4.d4 is the main line and is much better.} Nc6 5. Nf3 Bg4 {Black now seizes the initiative.} 6. Be2 O-O-O {Black has a more comfortable position. Black has more space and has already castle whereas mot of my pieces are confined to the first 2 ranks.} 7. d3 e6 8. h3 Bh5 9. O-O Bd6 10. Bd2 {A discovered attack on the queen. It as very little space to move around in now.} Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Qe5 {Threatens a battery mate on h2.} 12. g3 {The only move to prevent it. This severely weakens the king side and black should have an easy job of hacking through my kingside with moves like h4,h5 or g4,g5.} Nd4 {If I was black here, I would start the attack by playing g5 immediately.} 13. Bg2 g5 {It is a good position for black. Black has an attack coming up.} 14. Re1 Qg7 {! The best square available. This move supports the pawn push to g4 and does not obstruct the f pawn.} 15. Ne4 {Threatens blacks major attacking piece and forces it off the useful diagonal.} Be7 16. Be3 Nf5 17. Bd2 Nd6 {At this point I was hoping black would take the bait on b2 so I could then play Bc3 forking the rook and queen but as I expected my opponent was wary of all of my plans.} 18. Bc3 f6 {Now black has adapted a somewhat passive position as I gain some counterplay. I would've definetely played bf6 and then after a few exchanges black could've cotinued the attack.} 19. Qf3 {A strong move which threatens a mate if nothing is done in the future.} Nb5 {19....Nxe4 was far better. After 20. Qxe4 c6. Black will only be down by a pawn.} 20. Nc5 {This is a poisoned knight. If black plays 20.... Bxc5 then 21. Qxb7+ Qc6+ 22.Kc8 Qxb5 racking up more material with a strong attack.  Now somehow white has turned the tables and has a powerful attack!} c6 {A possibility to prevent Qxb7. Another option was Nd6 I think both were just as worse. From this point in I was in a strong attacking position. } 21. Nxb7 {! White smashes through blacks defences. If 21.... Kxb7 then 22. Qxc6+ Kb8 23. Qb7+#  White uncorks the fireworks!} Rd5 {One of the only defensive resources black has. This proved to be the losing move. Something like 20... Bd8 would allow black to last much longer because now the queen has access to the 7th rank and can block checks.} 22. Rxe6 {! White infiltrates blacks position.} Kxb7 {A disaster! Black king is now of the dangerous a8-h1 diagonal and now Rxc6 can be played!} 23. Rxc6 {!! White finally smashes through all of blacks defences! } Kxc6 {? A blunder. This move loses on the spot. 24.Qxd5+ Kc7 25.Ba5+  Kc8/b8 26. Qb7+#} 24. Qxd5+ Kc7 25. Ba5+ {Black resigns here knowing the future mate. I hope you enjoyed!}
