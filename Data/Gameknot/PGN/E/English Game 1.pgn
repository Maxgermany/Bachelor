[Opening "English opening (A15)"]

1. c4 {Here it is; the English Opening. Obviously rife with transpositional potential, it is technically a flank opening and one of the strongest first moves White can make.} Nf6 {The noncommittal response (very common).} 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {Black is taking on an Indian position of some nature; until his center evolves it could still be one of several openings. White, meanwhile, is just developing naturally.} 4. e4 {Cramping d5.} c5 5. d4 cxd4 6. Nxd4 d6 {Now we've got what looks like a Sicilian Dragon, but with the significant difference of White's pawn on c4, all but preventing the queenside castling typical of that opening.} 7. Be2 {Preparing to castle as well as preventing any Black shenanigans on g4.} Nc6 8. Be3 O-O 9. O-O {Both sides are now mostly developed. White has a stronger central presence and more space, but Black's position is solid--typical of a flank defense like the one Black chose here against solid play by White.} Bd7 10. Qd2 a5 {?! Risky and aggressive. The thought is to push this pawn all the way to a3 if possible, with chances to life the Black Rook to any number of squares from which it can attack the White center from the side. It does create weaknesses on b5 and b6, though, which White may exploit...} 11. Ndb5 {Like this.} a4 12. c5 {White attacks! Black's central pawns are feeling a little fragile.} Ng4 {I don't like this very much. I think 12...dxc5 13.Bxc5 Re8 was a better play overall. The text is essentially a distraction attempt: 13.Bxg4 Bxg4 would ease Black's game considerably.} 13. cxd6 {White does not take the bait.} exd6 {Again, not very accurate I think. 13...Nxe3 14.dxe7 Qxe7 15.Qxe3 looks better to me.} 14. Rad1 {This is smart play. The d-pawn can be won at any time, so White chooses to mass up on it--and as a result, pressuring the weak Bishop on d7 as well.} Be5 {Cheap and weak. 14...Nxe3 was still best.} 15. f4 {Obviously.} Nxe3 16. Qxe3 Bg7 {The Bishop is back in its little hole, sad and alone. If Black had any inkling of the storm he was about to face, he'd have played 16...Bxc3 instead...} 17. Nd5 {! I was expecting 17.Rxd6, but the text is vastly better. As ptitroque said, he can win my d-pawn any time he wants to--it's more important to get his pieces into great position. This Knight will not be easy to dislodge.} Bxb2 {? Petty and weak, and a waste of time. 17...Ne7 or 17...Be6 were probably better. Black is seriously cramped, and needs to exchange to loosen up his position.} 18. Nxd6 {White's Knights are absolutely invincible, and they are just crushing Black's options. Now b7 is threatened, as well as the devastating f4-f5. There's no way to defend against both adequately.} Rb8 {18...f5 might well have been better, considering what comes next...} 19. f5 {!} Be5 {? Black needed to play 19...Bf6 or 19...gxf6 (as dangerous as that looks). The text move is useless, though I didn't see it at the time. I thought I was threatening the Nd6, buying time to play ...gxf6 without letting the WQ get to g3, but...} 20. f6 {! Threatening 20...Bxd6?? 21.Qh6! with mate to come.} Bxf6 {The only move.} 21. Nxf6+ Kg7 22. Qc3 {With a bevy of threats. I'm pretty sure it's not a forced mate, but Black can probably resign right here.} Qb6+ {One last try.} 23. Kh1 Qb4 {Black desperately tries to secure a Queen trade...} 24. Nh5+ {...But White is too careful. It's mate in two.} Kh6 25. Qe3+ {Mate in one.} g5 26. Rf6# {Brilliant execution by White. Black's passive play allowed a devastating lead in space and activity, and good solid play from there assured that there was no coming back. Very well played by White--I would have expected better from Black ;) Hopefully I'll fare better in our next game. Many thanks to ptitroque for the game, and thanks for reading!}
