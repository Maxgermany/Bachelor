1. d4 {This game finally ends my drought between my father and I. Online games vs my father are rather poor but, I sit down at the board in real life and win game after game. I feel somewhat detached to my online games; thereby I end up not focusing on them enough and I lose.  Anyway enough with the commentary no one really cares all that much about and on to the details of this game. Starts off with the typical d4 push.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {KID has become common place since we both started studying it over 1 year ago. Though the lines have degraded to less than theoretic means.} e5 7. Be3 {Opening book is O-O but this move is playable.} Ng4 {Attacking the e3 bishop.} 8. Bg5 {Keeping the tempi even.} f6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 {Hopefully I can used the weakened king-side. } Nh6 {Stopping possible knight sacrifices with the bishops discovery on the knight. } 11. dxe5 {I don't want the center to close up with black having a positional weakness. My dxe5 plan was Qd5+ grabbing control of the d-file.} fxe5 12. Qb3 {Threatening c5+ busting open the center.} Be6 {Free pawn!} 13. Qxb7 Nd7 14. b3 {lowering the threat to the b-file with Rb8.} Nc5 15. Qb4 {This square is the best spot for the queen. Qd6 but Rb8 and the queen is in trouble. And Qb5 a5 The queen is trapped yet again.} a5 16. Qa3 Bd7 {I was expecting a4 but was pleased to see this move. Time to get out of the center.} 17. O-O Bc6 {Black threatens the e4 square. So what now defend it with Nd2. No I say I refuse to be passive.} 18. Bxe5 {! closing this diagonal down or trading bishops.} dxe5 19. Qxc5 {My pieces continue to get more active as the game goes. } Qe8 {?! Better was Ra6.} 20. Nxg5 Bf6 21. h4 {Keeping the knight at its active post.} Ra6 22. Nd5 {My beautiful knights :).} Bxd5 23. Qxd5+ Kh8 24. c5 {This novelty takes control of the e6 square so my knight can now come there.} Ng8 {?? misses the obvious Bxa6 } 25. Bxa6 Ne7 {Black resigns.}
