[Opening "Four knights (C47), Scotch, 4...exd4"]

1. e4 {The 'King's Pawn Opening (B00)' is what white starts with. It is the most popular chess opening, and also one I am accustomed to opening with now. I had strange openings in the past, but now I'm just keeping it simple. } e5 {I, black, continue with the 'King's Pawn Game (C20)', a standard response. For about the fist 10 moves, these are all book moves, so really nothing exciting. } 2. Nf3 {Another popular move, the 'King's Knight Opening (C40)'. This is something I've played very often, so I'm used to it. } Nc6 {Black continues the 'King's Pawn Game (C44)'. } 3. Nc3 {Ah, another position I've played a lot, called the 'Three Knights Game (C46)'. I think we all see why it's named this. } Nf6 {Probably no surprise that I played this. Also probably no surprise that's this is called the 'Four Knights Game (C46)'. } 4. d4 {'Four Knights (C47), Scotch Variation'. Okay, not something I've encountered as much, but definitely no worry here. } exd4 {Black plays the 'Four Knights (C47), Scotch, 4...exd4'. Yes, that is the full name of this move. } 5. Nxd4 {Still continuing with the Four Knights Scotch. Again, not much excitement in the beginning, but I'm doing my best to make the right moves of course. } Bb4 {Although this is a position I'm not that used to seeing, I may not know the perfect moves to make, but I know which moves are wrong, which I'm sure is helping me here. } 6. Nxc6 {I was actually expecting that move. } bxc6 {I could of played 6. dxc6, but that would of most likely resulted in a Queen's exchange, and I decided it was a little too early for that. } 7. Bd3 {Protecting the e4 pawn I'd say. } d5 8. exd5 cxd5 {The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious. } 9. Qe2+ {If you look at the games Database, most of these moves are the most popular made. So far it seems black has made all the most popular moves, per the game database. White has not in all cases, including this one. Most popular was to castle, but I'd say white is being the aggressor, which is no problem for him. I think both me and him work better with fewer pieces on the board, and I think white is working toward exchanges here. } Be7 {Black could of played Be6 or Qe7, but this move would prove to be the best move. Be6 could make my king more vulnerable and Qe7 would of likely led to a Queen's exchange, which I still did not want as of yet. } 10. Bb5+ {Not quite the move I was expecting. Of course, expect the unexpected, but I would of thought white would of castled. I'm planning to do so myself, thus I won't be moving my king. } Bd7 {I use my LSB to protect my king. } 11. Bxd7+ {Well that I was expecting. } Qxd7 {I could of done 3 other moves, but they weren't as good as this one. Kxd7 would of opened my king up to white more and prevented me from castling. Nxd7 would of lost me a pawn. Of course Kf8 is useless. Thus, Qxd7 was the best move, as it gets my queen involved as well. . } 12. Bg5 O-O {Black castles as planned.} 13. O-O-O {Interesting, I do not see a queen-side castle all too often. The reason for this probably involved the fact that white's rook now put extra pressure on black's d5 pawn, thus making this move better than a king-side castle. } c6 {I saw this during the game though, thus I give the d5 pawn some extra protection. } 14. f3 h6 {I decide to attack the intruding Bishop. } 15. Bh4 {Well I was expecting white to take my knight, but this move can be expected just as much. } Rab8 {This move here may not seem to have much of a point here, but then, I was thinking of a way to get to white's king. Obviously this is no longer the game's beginning, but the middle now, thus, it was time to get a strategy to win. What your opponent does though, will always change that strategy. } 16. Rhe1 {I'll have to attend to this move. Black's e7 bishop is under pressure from white's Queen and Rook combo. Of course I see this, so I counter. } Rfe8 {This move was definitely the best. True, I could of used my b8 rook instead of my now e8 rook, but I've been taking on advice I would always forget, and that was making your weakest piece stronger. 16. Rbe8 would of only hindered the other rook, but Rfe8 makes both rooks doing something, making them a good part of this game, which gives white more to work on. In fact, probably the only piece not making much of a difference on black's side at the moment is the a7 pawn. All other pieces are taking the front of white's attack. } 17. Qd3 {I'm not quite sure what white is planning now, but of course I'm keeping an eye on things. } Bd6 {Before I go on, I will use the game database quite often in creating annotations when it comes to the beginning stages. I use the computer analysis for the rest. I do this to get a better understanding of the game. In fact, the computer analysis always helps me see moves I didn't see when I'm creating annotations. It's kinda amazing, but not even the computer analysis mentioned any kind of mistake until this move. 17 moves without any mistakes, considering the ratings of both players, is pretty impressive. I am aware that strong players and grand masters can see mistakes the computer cannot, but the computer can still be reliable. For instance, this move is a inaccuracy because if white plays Bxf6 next move, the only good move black can make is gxf6, which would open up black's king to white. Although it's not that big of a mistake, even a small mistake can change the outcome of a game.  } 18. Rxe8+ {Okay, I was not quite expecting this. This move is not bad at all, but I would think Bxf6 would of been just slightly better because of the reasons I stated in the previous move. } Nxe8 {By now I did see the danger my knight and king were in, thus with the d5 pawn well protected, I took white's rook with my knight. } 19. Bg3 {Another piece exchange is about to occur here. As I mentioned earlier, I think I do play better with fewer pieces on the board, and I think the same goes for white. } Bxg3 20. hxg3 {Even exchange as mentioned. } Nf6 {With white's bishop gone, I decide to put my knight back where it was. } 21. b3 {I think white responded here to my b8 rook threat, at last. } Rd8 {I decide to plan an advancement with my d5 pawn by doubling up the queen and rook. } 22. Kb2 {It kinda looks like white is in a standoff kind of position with this move.} Kf8 {I don't really know why I made this move. As you can see, this game took almost 2 months to complete, and I was under lots of stress during the period of this game actually, so slow move times plus stress, well, I may of simply forgot what I had planned to do. Oh well, this move isn't any bad either. } 23. g4 {Connecting the pawns. } g5 {Here I decide to stop any forward progression of white's pawns, without a fight of course. This is an inaccuracy though, per what the computer analysis says. This is because white can advance his pieces to a position where I have to back off into a corner kind of, which is never a good thing, but this is still only a small mistake. } 24. Qf5 {Not what I was expecting. In fact, the computer sees this as a mistake, for if queens are exchanged, black can advance his pieces to where he can gain white's three f and g pawns, which would allow black to gain the advantage, provided I do decide to exchange.} Qxf5 {I do decide here that I'm ready to exchange, not only because of his queen being a threat, but also I can knock his pawns out of formation a little. At least, this is what I was thinking when doing this. I did not have the knowledge of the computer analysis then of course, so I was going by what I saw was best. } 25. gxf5 c5 {This was not one of my better moves, but although this is another inaccuracy, per the computer analysis, the only thing I could find wrong with this move is that white could advance some and back me up some, which is still not a good thing, but still only a minor mistake, if even that, in my opinion. } 26. g4 {White reorganizes his pawns. } a6 {Although d4 may of been a good move here, looking at this position, now white won't play Nb5 with this move, so this is a good move. } 27. a4 {Now this the computer analysis says this is an inaccuracy. This is one of those times where you don't have to listen to the computer, because I could not find anything wrong with this move. I'm sure someone can, but simply put, I'm not that skilled. Maybe there was a better move, but in my view, this move isn't bad. } d4 {Now I play d4. This, of course, means that white will have to defend his knight. } 28. Ne4 {I was expecting this move. } Nxe4 29. fxe4 {Once again, an even exchange. } f6 {As you can see, this game continues to be very even still. White may be a little more organized, which might be why the computer analysis gives white the advantage, at this moment. } 30. Re1 {I'm thinking white may try advancing his e pawn. I wasn't considering that then. } a5 {This move would be an inaccuracy, per the computer analysis. I can see why Re8 was the best move, for then white wouldn't advance his e pawn. If he does advance it now, it would for sure cost me a pawn no matter what I do. Although only a pawn, when you look at the board now, just one pawn could mean the game. } 31. Kc1 {? Not e5? I didn't realize it then, but looking now, I am a bit surprised he didn't play e5. Maybe he has a plan of his own? Of course the computer analysis sees this as a inaccuracy.} Kf7 {I decide to give my f6 pawn some more protection with this move, in case white advances. } 32. Kd2 {Another king move by white. Although the computer sees this as an inaccuracy, I can't see why. This isn't a bad move, but e5 is definitely the best. In fact, white is planning something, but black will catch on. } Rh8 {Alright, this is where it gets more interesting! Now I'm focused on advancing the g pawn! } 33. Rh1 {White is on to my plan already, although this was another inaccuracy, per computer analysis. If you look at the analysis for this move, you can see why this is an inaccuracy. If white had played Kd3 instead, he would of had a better chance of keeping my pawn from advancing and keeping the game very even, probably to the point of a draw. } Ke7 {I actually see this plan white has, which is to attack the d, c, and a pawns, so now I'm ready to stop any plans by white in case he does advance the king towards my pawns. } 34. Kd3 {He does advance his king, so now I think we all know what I'll do next.} Kd6 35. Rf1 {The game is no longer even. Mistake by white. This is because now the chances of black promoting their g pawn has increased, and white will have to work to keep it from happening. } h5 {If you couldn't see it in the previous move, you can probably now see why white shouldn't of moved his rook to where he did. } 36. gxh5 Rxh5 {Now the g pawn is in great position. } 37. Rf3 {Another mistake by white. The computer analysis says this because, if black plays it right, black can gain white's e and f pawns. This I did not see though during the game. } g4 {Advancing the pawn. } 38. Rf1 {A bit surprised white played that instead of Rg3. That would of kept my pawn from advancing further, and then I would have to move my rook to either g5 or h4 to protect my pawn. } g3 {I didn't see all the good moves, thus this is an inaccuracy. This move can allow white to take my advancing pawn and exchange rooks. Although that would still leave white in a hard place, what I have now would be better. } 39. Rg1 Rg5 {White moves his rook, of course I protect. } 40. c3 {I was expecting white to get their king involved, but I guess he may be wanting to advance his pawns as well. } Ke5 {I could of taken, but I saw a better formation in getting my king involved. } 41. cxd4+ {No surprise here. } cxd4 {Resignation by white. ??? Um, surprise? Not what I was expecting at all! Well, you can tell me, was this game a win by black or could white pull off a draw? I think it was more of a draw than a win for black, at least in my view. White still had options for sure. Well, maybe the game ended prematurely, but what a game it was! I'm glad I was able to show the skill I did. I'm sure I'll have even more great games against this opponent in the future! Now, interesting side note, in the final moves of this game, I had someone watching this game and telling me that I should offer a draw. I don't know why, but as we can see, I wouldn't of won if I did. So don't always listen to someone if you think you can do better. Yes in some cases, but not all cases. Well anyway, I hope you all enjoyed my annotation! I'll be sure to have another one way sooner this time. Until next time ;)}
