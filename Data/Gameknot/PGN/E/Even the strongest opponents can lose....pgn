1. e4 {I liked this game because it demonstrates a topic covered in a recent Chess Life magazine issue: not to play less carefully because of a rating spread in your favor. The article, written by the brilliant GM Lev Alburt, analyzed a game in a simul between a 1440 player and IM Tim Taylor (with the IM of course being the one playing multiple games). I looked over this game and saw it had the same major concept.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {The Scotch Game. } exd4 {The standard move. } 4. Nxd4 {Although this is the beginning of the main line, there is another variation that is very interesting, called the Goering Gambit. It starts when, instead of recapturing the pawn, White plays 4. c3, tempting Black to trade. It is a very solid gambit, as not only will the b1-knight be developed with tempo, but also White can take complete control of the center and could potentially set up a queen-bishop battery on b3 and c4. It's a very sound gambit. } Qh4 {This is the Pulling Counter-attack. Black has two main motives: one, to tempt White into playing g3??, where Black can play the devastating ...Qxe4  followed by ...Qxh1; two, to post a bishop at c5 to attack f2. } 5. Nc3 {The vital move, protecting the e-pawn. GK lists this as the Steinitz variation. (Yet another opening attributed to the chess genius.)} Bc5 {5...Bb4! was better for Black, according to the GK database, and the logic is clear. If White plays 6. g3?, to chase off the queen, Black plays 6...Bxc3 !! followed by 7...Qxe4  and 8...Qxh1. (Moving the pawn to g3 seems so natural, but is only safe when the e-pawn is sufficiently guarded.)} 6. g3 {Chasing off the enemy queen. However, 6. Be3 was stronger, since a bishop would be useful on the a7-g8 diagonal to protect f2.} Qf6 7. Nf5 {A novel idea. The standard plan is to play 7. Nf3 and 8. Bg2. } d6 {Planning to get rid of the knight, after which the queen will have direct access to f7. } 8. Nd5 {A brilliant move! This threatens not only to capture the queen, but to capture c7 as well, winning the rook. And White can also capture g7 once the queen moves. Black, whose position once looked great, now is falling apart...} Qd8 {The only move, protecting c7. However, White has another threat...} 9. Nxg7+ {Bam! And White shatters Black's kingside. } Kf8 10. Nh5 {The knight would have been captured if placed on f5. } Nce7 {Black tries to get rid of the knight, but doesn't expect White's next move...} 11. Bg5 {This must have come as a groaner to Black. The only thing stopping the bishop from forking the queen and king at e7 is the knight on g8.} c6 {One last futile move to try to drive away the knight...} 12. Nxe7 {White decides to trade, allowing the bishop to come to h6 and end the game. } Nxe7 {Black has no option but to recapture, but is forced into...} 13. Bh6+ {A deadly check! No matter what Black does, 14. Nf6 is checkmate. Black resigned.  This game goes to show how rating should not determine your style of play. Anyone can make mistakes, and using circular reasoning, anyone can make brilliant moves! Never let your guard down, and think carefully through your moves. }
