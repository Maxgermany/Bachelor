1. e4 {This game has many interesting positions and the analysis is quite complicated, so it's possible to spot some inaccuracies. Sorry for my bad English!} c5 2. Nc3 {Spassky main variation in the '60} e6 {Played by Korchnoi vs Spassky in the Candidates Final 1968} 3. g3 {The so called "closed" variation. } Nc6 {3... d5 is another main line. It's a matter of taste... } 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. d3 {5. Nge2 is more elastic because white can play d4 } Be7 6. f4 d6 {6... d5 is more thematic } 7. Nf3 a6 {The main line according to theory is 7... O-O 8. O-O Qb6 } 8. O-O {White has now the interesting option 8. e5!? e.g.: 8...dxe5 9. Nxe5 and now if 9... Nxe5? 10. fxe5 Nd7 11. Qg4! attacking the king's side } Qc7 9. Ne2 {This is rather slow. According to theory the immediate 9. h3 O-O 10. g4! is more accurate } b5 10. h3 O-O 11. g4 Bb7 12. a3 {I can't understand this move. Why not a developing move? 12. Be3 } e5 {This weakens the f5 square. Maybe 12... d5!? } 13. f5 {White is looking for a pawn attack in the king's side but it was interesting 13. Ng3!? with the idea to play Nf5 } Nd4 {13... h6 was best, preventing g5, with a slight advantage for black } 14. Nexd4 {It was better to play 14. g5! with a very complicated position: a) 14... Ne8 15. Nfxd4 (15. Ng3!?) 15... cxd4 16. c3!? and white is slightly better or 16. Ng3!?  b) 14. ... Nd7 and now: b1) 15. Nfxd4 cxd4 16. c3!? with a small edge. Less convincing is 16. f6!? gxf6 17. gxf6 Nxf6 18. Bh6 Kh8! with active play for black b2) 15. Ng3 Bd8! (and not 15... f6 16. g6 h6 17. Bxh6! gxh6 18. Qd2 b3) 15. f6 gxf6 16. gxf6 Bxf6 (Not 16... Nxf6 17. Nexd4 cxd4 18. Bh6 with a strong attack) 17. Nfxd4 (Less strong seems 17. Nexd4 cxd4 18. Bh6 Kh8! with a very complicated position) 17... exd4 (Not 17... cxd4 18. Ng3! with attck) 18. Bh6 Kh8! with a sharp position} cxd4 15. Bg5 {Dubious. Better was 15. g5 Ne8!} d5 {Stronger was 15... h6 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 blocking dark squares in the king's side } 16. Bxf6 Bxf6 17. g5 Bd8 {17... dxe4 was clearly better with black's advantage} 18. Qe2 {A mistake. 18. exd5 was better } f6 {Black missed 18... dxe4 19. dxe4 Rc8 with a clear plus } 19. h4 {Missing an important chance. Thematic is 19. g6! and now: a) 19... dxe4 20. gxh7+ Kxh7 21. Nh4! (Not 21. dxe4? Qc4) 21... e3 (If 21... exd3 22. Qh5+ Kg8 23. Ng6) 22. Qh5+ Kg8 23. Bxb7 Qxb7 24. Rae1 and white is better b) 19...h6 20. exd5 (If 20. Nh2 dxe4 21. Bxe4 Rc8 22. Ng4 Bxe4 23. Qxe4 Qd7! but not 23... Qxc2? 24. Nxh6+ gxh6 25. Qd5+ Kh8 26. Qd7 Qc7 27. g7+) 20... Rc8 (If 20... Bxd5 21. Nxe5!) 21. Nd2 Qd7 (If 21... Qxc2 22. d6! Bxg2 23. Kxg2 - threatening Rac1 - 23... Bb6 24. Rab1) 22. d6! Bxg2 (After 22... Rxc2 23. Bxb7 Qxb7 24. Qe4 Qxe4 25. Nxe4 Rxb2 26. Rfc1 and white has a big advantage) 23. Qxg2 Qxd6 24. Qb7 Qc6 with a balanced position but NOT 24... Rxc2? 25. Ne4 Qc6 26. Qxc6 Rxc6 27. Rac1 Rxc1 28. Rxc1 Bb6 29. Rc6 Rb8 30. b4 } dxe4 20. dxe4 Rc8 {Black is better now} 21. Rac1 {21. Rf2 seems better } Qc6 {21... Qc4! was best. White must exchange queens because Black threatens 22. ... Qa2. The resulting endgame is better for black and without Queens white can't create complications on the king's side } 22. gxf6 Bxf6 {Stronger was 22... Qxf6 and if 23. Ng5 Bb6 } 23. Ng5 Qb6 {Again, 23... Qc4 was better } 24. Kh2 Rc6 25. Rfg1 {Maybe 25 c3!?} Bc8 26. Bf1 Bd7 {26... d3! was stronger if 27. Qh5 h6 28. Bxd3! hxg5 29. hxg5 Bd8 30. g6 (If 30. Rcf1 g6!) 30... Qf2+} 27. Qg2 { 27. Qh5 h6 28. Nf3 Kh8 29. Bd3 was more active } Qc7 28. Bd3 Bc8 {Too tame. After 28... h6 29. Nf3 Bxf5 30. exf5 e4+ 31. Qg3 exd3 32. Qxc7 Rxc7 33. cxd3 black has a better ending } 29. Qe2 {After 29. Qg3 the position is still balanced } Qe7 {This is a mistake. The queen isn't well placed here. Better was 29... h6! 30. Nf3 (If 30. Qh5 Bxf5! 31. exf5 Bxg5 32. hxg5 e4+ 33. Kh3 exd3 34. gxh6 Qf4 35. f6 Rcxf6! and black wins)  30... Bxf5! 31. exf5 e4+ 32. Kh1 exd3 33. Qxd3 Re8 with a big advantage } 30. Qh5 h6 31. Nh3 {Why not the simple 31. Nf3 ? } Bd7 32. Qxh6 Bxh4 {It's also interesting 32... Bxf5 33. exf5 e4 34. Rxg7+! Qxg7 35. Qxg7+ Kxg7 36. Bxe4 } 33. Qh5 Rh6 {A big blunder. 33...Bf6 was probably best After 33... Be8 white has 34. Rg6! with a promising position. Let's see: a) 34...Bxg6?? 35.fxg6 and white wins b) 34... Bf6 35. Nf2 (Threatens 36.Rh1 If 35. Rh1 Qc7 36. Kg1 Rxc2 37. Bxc2 Qxc2 38. Ng5 Qc1+) and now: b1) 35... Qc7 36. Ng4 Bxg6 37. fxg6 Rc8 (If 37... Re8 38. Nxf6 gxf6 39. g7!) 38. Rf1 b2) 35... Qd8 36. Ng4  Bxg6 37. fxg6 Re8 38. a4! (Not 38. Rf1 Kf8 39. Nxf6 Rxf6 40. Qh8+ Ke7 41. Qxg7+ Ke6) 38... bxa4 39. Rf1 Ree6 (If now 39... Kf8 40. Nxf6 Rxf6 41. Qh8+ Ke7 42. Qxg7+ Ke6 43. Bc4+! wins)  and after 40.Kg2! white has a strong pressure. Despite material advantage, black is tied up } 34. Qxh6 {}
