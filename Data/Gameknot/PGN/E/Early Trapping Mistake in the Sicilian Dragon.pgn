1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense.  It's my favorite e4 response, too.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {This is the first Sicilian game I've played on GameKnot that followed the standard sequence.  When I first played it as Black, I met 2. .. d4.} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. f4 {As White, I often struggle finding a good way to attack the Sicilian.  The Levenfish here seemed rash to me when I first encountered it, but its potential to loosen Black's defenses won me over.} Bg7 {Not good.  Definitely a mistake, though it doesn't look that dangerous.  The Bb5+ threat is obvious, but combined with the e5 pawn advance that's coming, Black gets locked into a losing position.  If I were Black, I believe my move would have been 6. .. e5.  Exchanging queens looks better than the coming situation, to me.} 7. e5 dxe5 8. fxe5 {Black's choices are all bad ones.  I think Ng4 looks like the best one, though Black is still down at least a knight.} Nd5 {A good general rule, at least: exchanging a piece whose position is untenable.  But putting another piece between the two Queens weakens Black's position against the coming check.} 9. Bb5+ {Inevitable, really.} Kf8 {Might be the best move.  9. .. Nc6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bxc6+ leaves Black down a pawn and a rook, while I don't know where exactly 9. .. Bd7 10. e6 would go.  It doesn't seem any better at first glance.} 10. O-O Nxc3 {The exchange, delayed.} 11. bxc3 {It didn't occur to me, but Qf3 would have been as good now as it was a move later.  At the time keeping the d4 Knight protected seemed important, but the threat of 12. ... Qxf7# protected the knight just fine.} Bd7 {Black offers another exchange.  If taken, Black will gain some room on the queenside.  If not taken, 13. .. Bxb5 14. Nxb5 Qxd1 15. Rxd1 Bxd5 leaves Black a pawn up.} 12. Qf3 {White threatens 13. Qxf7# checkmate.  Be6 can't prevent it.  Qe8 doesn't go well, either.  f5 or f6 look good, but even the best-case scenario results in 13. Qxb7, threatening 14. Qxa8 netting a rook, 14. Bxd7 Nxd7 15. Ne6+ forking Black's King and Queen, or 14. e6's various consequences.} Bxb5 13. Qxf7# {Unexpectedly quick.  Black just didn't see it.  While it was a simple mistake that led to checkmate so soon, this game made me reconsider the Sicilian.  Though I knew this particular line (the Levenfish Attack) better than recursiondepth, it would be just as easy for me to fall into a trap with a move that appears relatively safe in any of the infinite other lines.  I felt that, despite Black's tactical mistakes, this game was decided primarily by memorization, which didn't sit well with me.  I enjoy fianchettos and asymmetrical openings both, but I won't be playing the Sicilian as often.}
