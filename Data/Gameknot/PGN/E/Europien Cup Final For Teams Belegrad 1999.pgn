1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Bc5 7. a4 Rb8 8. c3 d6 9. d4 Bb6 10. Na3 O-O 11. axb5 axb5 12. Nxb5 exd4 13. cxd4 Bg4 14. Re1 {Interesting, the practical continuation proved that after whites moves 14.Bc2 , doesn't give white a big advantage for example , 14.Bc2-d5.15.Bg5-Bxf3.16.Qxf3-Bxd4.17.exd5-Qxd5... or 15.e5-Ne4.16.Be3-f6... } d5 {The idea is to challenge whites center ,and get very nice compensation for the lost pawn ,by activating black pieces while whites queens side seems to be harm, if black got back the pawn by 14...Nxd4 than .15.Nbxd4-Bxd4.16.h3 (16.Bxf7+-Rxf7.17.Qxd4-Bxf3.18.gxf-Nh5 gives black good chances) 16...Bxf3.17.Qxf3 and white have good bishops pare and active Pieces.} 15. exd5 Nxd5 16. h3 Bh5 17. g4 Bg6 18. Nc3 Ndb4 19. Bg5 Qd7 {Black have clear compensation for the lost pawn , whites queens side is weak and black activate his pieces well .} 20. d5 Qd6 {Mistake , it seems to be a logical move but wrong , the idea is to offer white to capture the knight on c6 and get very power full  attack on the king and expose totally whites king side for example , 21.dxc-Qg3+.22.Kh1-Qxh3+23.Nh2-Nd3 with very Strong attack , however the best move was 20...Na5!.21.Ne5-Qd6.22.Rxa5-Bxa5.23.Be7-Qxe7.24.Nxg6-Qxe1+.25.Qxe1-hxg...or 21.Ba4-Qd6 and black have big contra chances .} 21. Kh1 {very good move , avoids black threat Qg3+ , attacks the knight on c6 and forcing black to retreat to passives positions} Na5 22. Be7 Qf4 23. Rxa5 {good move , white is  continues to play well ,sacrificing an exchange with the idea to keep the powerful bishop pare ,drops the black bishop from the good diagonal a7-g1, and puts the black queen in dangerous position where she doesn't have good moves to retreat if she will be under attack , the bishop pare are working hormonally when the BLS controls the c4 square while BDS covers the h4-d8 diagonal . if 23.Bxf8 -Nxb3.24.Bxb4-Nxa1.. or 23.Ra4-Nxb3.24.Bxb4-Rfe8 with unclear position .} Bxa5 24. Re3 Bb6 {If 24...Rfe8 than 25.d6! with big advantage for white ....} 25. Ne2 Qh6 26. Kg2 Bxe3 27. g5 Qxh3+ {Good move , this queen scarifies leads to very complicating position where white have material advantage while black have very powerful initiative , interesting was 27...Bxg5.28.Bxg5-Bc2 .29.Bxc2-Qa6 and maybe white have better attacking chances even that blacks position is good . } 28. Kxh3 Nd3 29. Qa1 {Not 29.fxe3-Nf2+ and the white queen dies .} Nxf2+ 30. Kg2 Rfe8 {If 30...Rxb3?.31.Bxf8-Kxf8.32.Ned4! and white is better ..} 31. Qa3 Nd3 32. Nc3 {Mistake, much better was 32.Ba4!-Rxb2(32...Bc5.33.Bxc5-Rxe2+.34.Kg3-Rbxb2.35.Bc2!and white is better ) 33.Qxb2-Nxb2 .34.Bxe8 with big advantage for white.} Bc1 33. Nd1 Be4 34. Ba4 Ne5 {Mistake , much better was 34...Ra8!.35.Bxe8-Rxa3.36.bxa3-Ne5!! and black with better endgame ,35.Kg3-Bf4+.36.Kg4-h5+.37.fxh6(U.P.) -f5+...., not 36....Ne1+.3.Kf2-Nxf3.38.Nc3-Bxg5.39.Nxe4-Bxe7.40.Kxf3-Bxf3= .} 35. Bxe8 Rxe8 36. Kg3 Bxf3 37. Qc3 {attacks 3 pieces at the same time .} Bxd1 {If 37...Rxe7.38.d6!-Re8.39.dxc and black is lost , not 38.Qxc1-Bxd5.39.Qc5-Rd7 ......} 38. Qxe5 Ba4 39. b4 {Black resigns , white threats to capture the pawn on c7 and if black defends it , the white queen will fork the bishop pare and win easily the game , there for if the c7 pawn dies than white will have 2 passing pawns which black will pay a big price for stopping out the pawns , there for black have no choice but to resign. hope you enjoy the game thank you :) }
