[Opening "Sicilian (B40), Pin variation (Sicilian counter-attack)"]

1. e4 c5 {sicilian} 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {blah blah blah...} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. f3 d6 {we're on the pin variation, ironically enough.} 7. Be3 b5 8. g4 {i believe this position favours white, however i doubt there's much in it at this stage.} b4 9. Nce2 {or a4, though i didn't really want him loading up on a4 with Bd7 and Qa5. back to b1 was never an option, that would pass the advantage to black.} e5 {here i think black's priorities are wrong, he really should be developing. this is weak anyway, since it has taken him two moves to get his pawn to e5, and when you're this far behind in development, you don't want to be losing tempi.} 10. Nb3 h6 {another pawn move...} 11. Ng3 g6 {and another. now white has a huge advantage i believe.} 12. Qd2 Nc6 {and finally black begins development.} 13. O-O-O Qd7 {i imagine black has ideas to get the queen to a4.} 14. h4 {allows Bh3, offers protection and doesn't block a pawn.} Be7 {Bg7 would surely be better, unless black has no intention of castling kingside.} 15. Bh3 Qc7 {of course, g5 would hurt otherwise.} 16. Bxh6 {! pawn grab?} Ng8 {black defends strongest, in terms of levelling.} 17. Bg5 {! a good move, as it forces black to push his pawn if he wishes to reclaim the pawn, thus blocking his bishop from having any control of h4.} f6 {indeed...} 18. Be3 Rxh4 {and he earns the pawn back, but at what cost?} 19. Bg2 Rxh1 {forced, no flight square for the rook, and he's not protected thanks to the seemingly passive Bg5.} 20. Rxh1 {and this is beginning to look very good for white, the h-file is open, black has not castled, and is yet to develop three pieces. that was a good pawn trade for white, disguised as a clumsy pawn grab.} Be6 {effective, develops the bishop and protects the knight, who is vulnerable to a pin.} 21. g5 a5 22. Kb1 Bxb3 {? this surprised me a great deal, surely that bishop was needed? i can only imagine he is hoping to get to endgame...} 23. cxb3 Nd8 {??  a dreadful move, the only word that truly describes this move is suicide.} 24. Qd5 {and here's why. so now we get to the reason i decided to annotate this one... i accept black played poorly, but i can't deny i finished him off in style, this is just the first of a series of devastating moves, and if ever you wanted to see effective pinning, then don't blink!} Qb7 {? this is very poor, black's has to play Rc8 and at the very least tie down my rook to defending the back rank, keeping him quiet. this move heavily contributes to black's eventual downfall, allowing me to pin his knight to two pieces. Rc8 would well and truly scupper this.} 25. Qxg8+ {obviously.} Kd7 {indeed. blocking with the bishop allows white to pass a pawn with gxf6, and with the queen deep in black's territory and the bishop close behind to protect, that's not a good thing at all.} 26. gxf6 {! means i can pin the bishop with a tempo.} Bxf6 {what else? Nc6 is not at all good here...  27... Nc6?  28 Bh3 ! Kc7 (no other flight square) 29 Qc4!... now the bishop is attacked by the pawn, and must move or hang... 29... Bxf6 Rh7  and the black queen is lost, since the bishop cannot block due to the knight being pinned to the king by the queen.} 27. Rh7+ Be7 {again, what else? note how the bishop is pinned and it's my go. if i hadn't traded pawns first, and just pinned him, i lose a tempo. also the diagonal has been cleared for the obvious yet match winning reply to this move...} 28. Bg5 {! more than just exerting more pressure on the bishop, it forces black's next move, and effectively sets the mating trap to follow...} Nc6 {black's king is now limited to just one flight square. and any other move would've dropped the bishop and rendered black pretty much impotent.} 29. Bh3+ {! timed to perfection} Kc7 {not a good square for black, but no choice.} 30. Qc4 {! and here's why it's not good... threatens the bishop again, since the knight is now also pinned, and the queen no longer attacked, and once again forces black's move if he wishes to save the bishop...} Kd8 {from zero protection to three pieces protecting... but not for long...} 31. Qd5 {! the icing on the cake, now the black queen is seriously overworked, and black's position collapses. the bishop is attacked and pinned to the queen, the knight is pinned to both the queen and rook, and for good measure i attack the pawn on d6, since the bishop is also pinned to his king by my nicely placed bishop. the black queen is burdened with the task of protecting the knight and the rook, since if the rook is unprotected, the knight remains pinned and the bishop remains helpless. remember 24... Qb7? now how bad does that move look? how does black unpin his knight and protect knight, bishop, rook and pawn? answer... he can't.} Ra7 {personally, i'd have resigned here, all hope is lost. Ra7 is effective in that it unpins the knight, so the bishop is now also safe, but there is no protection for the poor little pawn on d6...} 32. Qxd6+ {and now mate is imminent.} Ke8 {Qd7 would be futile, Rh8#, as both queen and bishop are pinned.} 33. Rh8+ Bf8 {and this for me was a lazy resignation, no attempt to delay with Kf7, Qe6+,  Kg7, Qg8#} 34. Rxf8# {and there we go. beautiful.  a nice queen/rook mate that is well worth remembering, it seems to come up quite a lot. hope you enjoyed the game.}
