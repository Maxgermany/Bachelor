1. d4 {I've picked this game for annotation because it resulted in an improbable victory from a near impossible position - (at one stage I was down 2 knights, 1 bishop, 1 rook and 4 pawns and had only captured a single pawn in return)  Tolemac has subsequently thrashed me in every game since. } Nf6 2. d5 {Not being a student of chess openings, this seemed like a good move at the time } e6 3. c4 {protecting my advanced pawn} Bb4+ 4. Nc3 {Blocking check} Ne4 5. Qc2 {protecting my knight and threatening Qxe4} Qf6 {Realised Qxe4 would result in the loss of rook and leave king exposed after Bxc3 } 6. Bd2 {Tolemac's previous move Qf6 was great, all my attention was on c3 and then...} Qxf2+ {BAM!... I'm in all sorts of trouble now} 7. Kd1 {Forced} Qxf1+ 8. Be1 {Forced} Nf2+ {Forked!} 9. Kd2 {Forced and keeping my bishop protected} Nxh1 10. Nf3 {Saving my knight} exd5 {pawn action} 11. cxd5 {Had to ensure I captured one piece this game} O-O {A surprising move... as it gives me a target (it did however free blacks rook for a potential attack on the E file)} 12. Ng5 {Given the state of the game, I'm prepared to take any opportunity on offer} Qf4+ {Argh! A trap!} 13. Kd1 {Forced} Qxg5 {Can things get any worse?... I've lost rook, bishop, knight and 2 pawns and have only captured 1 pawn in return} 14. Bd2 {Maybe Tolemac will take pity on me and leave his Queen there...  Actually, I realised that I needed to get my king out of the firing line and moved the bishop to block the check on c1} Qxg2 15. Kc1 Qxh2 16. Kb1 {Got my king out of the way for the loss of 2 more pawns} Bxc3 {And then lost a knight as well... -17... I pressed the resign button at this point in time and then decided against it as I wanted to see how long I could last.} 17. Qxc3 {Aha! I finally captured a major piece... there is still hope -14} Nf2 18. Qd4 {Can't remember why I moved here... (maybe I can get my bishop on c3?)} d6 {freeing up white bishop} 19. a3 {Giving my king somewhere to hide} Na6 20. Be3 {Might as well threaten black's knight, I figure Bc3 is a silly move as it is easily blocked} Bf5+ {Check!... Black's knight is safe on this turn... Luckily I made my king a hiding spot... Additionally it frees up my rook} 21. Ka2 Ng4 {Knight got away! } 22. Rg1 {A move of the knight threatens Qxg7# } g6 {Stopping the possibility of Qxg7#} 23. Bd2 {Saving my bishop} c5 {Threatening my Queen} 24. dxc6 e.p. {Don't you just love "en passant" ... at least when it suits you} Be6+ {Not sure of Black's purpose here... } 25. Kb1 f5 {That's what the purpose was...} 26. cxb7 {Captured another pawn... things are looking up, only -12 now} Rab8 27. Bc3 {Waited long enough...time to threaten Qg7#} Ne5 {Nope, Tolemac is still watching this game} 28. Re1 {Time to protect my pawn} Rxb7 29. Qxd6 {Threatening Qxe6 } Rb6 {Stopping the possibility} 30. Qe7 {Can't remember why I moved here... maybe thinking of capturing a7} Qg3 {A potentially fatal mistake!} 31. Rh1 {Theatening Qxh7#} h5 {stopped that idea} 32. Bd4 {probably my best move in the game... The trap is set!} Rc6 {Trying to save a rook unfortunately....} 33. Rg1 { ...resulted in the loss of a queen. (Between queen, bishop and rook, checkmate is forced if the black queen is not lost)} Qxg1+ {As expected my rook is lost} 34. Bxg1 {Thankyou!} Nc7 {The odds of a victory are still against me} 35. Bd4 {Time the threaten the knight blocking my victory} Rf7 {Got to save my queen first} 36. Qd8+ Rf8 37. Qg5 {After 36 Qd8  Rf8, I found a safe spot...additionally threatening Qxg6  if blacks knight moves} Bb3 {Trying to protect g6} 38. Bxe5 {With the Knight lost black is desperate to try and get a checkmate } Rd8 {An unfortunate error...threatening 39. ... Rd1  and subsequent Checkmate after 40. Qc1 Rxc1#} 39. Qxd8+ {Black Resigns...   A remarkable victory against all odds}
