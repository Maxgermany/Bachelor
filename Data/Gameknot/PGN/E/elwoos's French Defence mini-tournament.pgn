1. e4 {This is from one of my games in my French Defence mini tournament. I wanted to learn more about the French. This game became quite an open one which I think is not that typical.  Please comment} e6 2. d4 d5 {Opening position} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 c5 {Although this is in the Gameknot database it's not very common at this point so I assume it's a little premature though I can't see why} 5. exd5 h6 6. Bxf6 Qxf6 7. Nf3 {This takes us out of the Gameknot database} cxd4 8. Qxd4 Qxd4 9. Nxd4 Bc5 10. Bb5+ Bd7 11. Nce2 O-O 12. c4 {It was here I decided I wanted to pin whites knight with Re8 but I needed to get my e pawn out of the way first} exd5 13. cxd5 Re8 {now the knight on d4 is undefended but white can get out of this as we will see} 14. Bxd7 Nxd7 15. O-O Nf6 {My knight seems better placed here to me if only because it threatens to regain a pawn} 16. f3 {This looks like a blunder to me as the knight on d4 is now pinned} Rxe2 {so I take advantage} 17. Rad1 Nxd5 {threatens to fork the rooks but I need to get my rook safe first if white breaks the pin} 18. Kh1 Rxb2 19. Nb3 {I can only assume that white missed the threatened fork} Ne3 20. Nxc5 Nxf1 {I chose this one so that white lost control of the open d file} 21. Rxf1 b6 {Now I am looking to promote one of my pawns on the side where I have an advantage} 22. Nd7 Rd8 23. Rd1 {This is a blunder from white as we will see, much better was to move the knight} Rxd7 {the d7 rook is immune due to Rxd7 Rb1+ leading to mate and so white resigned  Thanks for reading please comment}
