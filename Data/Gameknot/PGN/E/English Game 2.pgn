1. c4 {Welcome to the second game in this English Opening series between ptitroque and I. He crushed me the first game, but I've got the White pieces this time, so let's see if I can turn it around: what I *can* promise is an interesting game! Enjoy! } Nf6 2. g3 {The exact move order is very fluid, but I do usually like to fianchetto at least this Bishop, to better contest d5. } e5 3. Bg2 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 {We're still 'on-book'. The position is basically a reversed Sicilian Dragon, now that the exchange in the center is complete. } 5. Nc3 Nb6 {I don't like this retreat a whole lot; I think Black could just as well play 5...c6 or 5...Be6 and maintain his claim to the center. } 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3 {White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening. } O-O 9. b4 {This serves to keep Black from occupying c5, and threatens a b4-b5 push, dislodging the Nc6 and disrupting the Black center as a result. } Be6 10. Rb1 {With two goals: keep Black out of b3, and give more potency to the queenside push. } a6 {Black locks up the minority attack on the queenside for now. } 11. d3 {Preparing to develop the Queen or Bishop to d2, and securing the c4 square against Black invaders. } f5 {!? Very aggressive, but dangerous. Black seems to want to get this pawn thrust done before playing ...Bf6, but he must be careful about the line he's just opened to his King (a2-g8). } 12. Bd2 {I decide I ought to keep my Bishop on the c1-h6 diagonal, since the f4 square might be in need of support soon. } Bd5 {? Black wants to lift his Knight to a central square and get rid of my defender of e4 (the Knight), but this actually loses at least a pawn as far as I can see. It's all thanks to the open line to the BK... I was expecting 12...Bf6 or maybe 12...Qe8. } 13. Nxd5 {First, White trades off the guardian of the light diagonal... } Nxd5 14. Qb3 {...And now the Knight is pinned to the King, with only the BQ to defend it. Black now has to waste a move getting out of the pin with 14...Kh8, and even that loses a pawn to 15.Nxe5 (...Nxe5 16.Bxd5). } Bf6 {? Black defends the trickier attack, but overlooks the straightforward one. } 15. e4 {Of course. Now White wins a piece. } Nce7 {This surprised me at the time, but looking back I don't know what was better. Perhaps 15...Kh8. The reason I'm looking for something 'better' is that the text cuts off the BQ's support of g5, allowing White's next move. } 16. Ng5 {Threatening a fork on e6 (and just a beautiful Knight placement in any situation). Of course the Black Knight is still pinned, so White can continue to maneuver and still win the material at his leisure. } c6 {?! Black chooses to allow the fork in the hopes of eliminating some of White's attacking potential. Together with the Knight he's still going to lose, it's certainly a big material hit, but at least he'll have a little compensation in the form of a big center and a short reprieve from the attack. } 17. Ne6 {Of course. } Qd7 18. Nxf8 Kxf8 19. exd5 cxd5 {So Black has a pawn for a Rook, but he can take a little comfort in his strong center and the fact that White doesn't have any threats for the moment. His strategy has to be a focus on the weak White d-pawn, but he can't afford to slip up on the way. } 20. f4 {Hoping to entice an exchange viz. 20...e4 21.dxe4 fxe4 where Black has two connected passed pawns in the center, but probably no way to convert them, and White has eliminated his weak isolani. } Nc6 {I think 20...e4 was the best option. The text just drops the d-pawn for nothing--a diminishment of the Black center that I don't think Black should have allowed. } 21. Qxd5 {Proposing a trade. I'm ahead by a full piece, so the faster I can get material off the board, the better. } Qc7 {Of course, Black declines. } 22. fxe5 Rd8 {Counterattack! When behind, complications are your friend. Black understands this well. } 23. Qe6 {? Outright miscalculation. I was expecting 23...Nxe5 24.Rxf5 and honestly didn't look too hard at the position. It bears mentioning, I think, that you must *always* look hard at every position! Better was 23.Qe4 or 23.Qc4. } Nd4 {! This is a great move. The Knight is in a good spot where it'll be hard to drive away, and Black gets his pawn back without giving up the one on f5. } 24. Qc4 Qxe5 25. Rbe1 Qb8 {The Queen has awfully few places to run. Note that 25...Qd6 is undesirable as well, because 26.Qc5! forces the trade. } 26. Bf4 Qa7 {Of course, the text achieves the same effect. Obviously 26...Qa8 would be simply miserable. } 27. Qc5+ {White finally forces the exchange. } Qxc5 28. bxc5 Nc2 {Black continues to make threats, while White continues to struggle to take pieces off the board. This is a nice strike by Black; there's no satisfactory defense for all of the threatened White soldiers (Re1, a3, and d3). } 29. Bd6+ {A nice little zwischenzug takes care of the defense of my d-pawn before I have to move my Rook... } Kf7 30. Rec1 {Not ideal, but about the best option in my opinion. Now I was expecting 30...Bd4+ 31.Kh1 Ne3, keeping the center a complicated mess and forcing the White King away from the action. White would clearly still be winning, but Black's counterplay is significant. } Nxa3 {? I really don't like this move. It does threaten to jump to b5 (trapping the White' DSB in a bunch of lines), but for the most part this Knight is now completely out of commission. } 31. Bd5+ {After a lot of thought I decided on this as my next strike. My basic plans are to play g3-g4 and then lift my Rooks up to where I can cut off the BK's escape routes. There's still enough material in the Black camp that an outright mate is still a ways away. } Kg6 32. g4 fxg4 {Now 32.Rf4 seems promising, but I couldn't find a clear line that didn't end with the BK hiding in relative safety within his pawns. So instead I decided to just keep simplifying the board until a mate presented itself. } 33. Be4+ Kf7 34. Bxh7 Nb5 {The Knight finally comes back into action... sort of. } 35. Be5 Rxd3 {There wasn't a lot this Rook could accomplish anyway. } 36. Bxd3 Ke6 37. Bxf6 {Continuing the trades. I should mention that before this point, my opponent very graciously asked if I'd like him to resign, as he clearly has no chance left. We decided to play it out for the sake of the annotation. } Nd4 {The Knight continues to attempt to be relevant (mainly by dying...) } 38. Rce1+ {No need to take it, though. } Kd5 39. Re5+ Kc6 40. Bxg7 {Making room for my other Rook. } Nb5 41. Rf6+ Kd7 {41...Kc7 lasts a bit longer, as the BK can hide in his pawns for an extra move or two. } 42. Bf5+ Kd8 43. Rf7 {Closing the trap. There's nothing Black can do now.} Nc7 44. Bf6# {There you have it! Many thanks to ptitroque for the opportunity to take my revenge in an exciting game. The next couple on the way are even more complex, so be on the lookout! Comments are much appreciated: thanks for reading! }
