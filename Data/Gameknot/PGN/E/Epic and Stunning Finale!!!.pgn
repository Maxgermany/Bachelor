1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {The Three Knights Game.} d6 4. Bc4 {I always do this kind of opening to expect the Four Knights Game Italian Variation.} Bg4 {This is exactly how I felt about this move: Really Black? Fine, I will let you take me.} 5. d3 {Sure enough, I ignore the Bishop and continue with my plan.} Nd4 6. Nd5 {I had to make sure I was watching out for possible tricks.} c6 7. Nc3 b5 {I definetely bought my one-way ticket to the torture chamber when I didn't see this coming.} 8. Bb3 {Now I regret sending my Bishop to c4. } Nxb3 9. axb3 {This move weakened my position quite a bit.} Nf6 10. h3 {Buzz off, Black Bishop. Why don't you help out YOUR poor pieces?} Be6 {The answer: Black's Bishop bought a getaway-for-free ticket. I so far played crummy moves and who knows what Black can do to my position disaster.} 11. O-O {The only move I could think about. Kingside castling.} b4 {After this move, I decided to play a lot more cautiously.} 12. Na4 {I had no other choice.} d5 13. c4 {Very chaotic so far } d4 {Black was rather wise to skip 13...exd4?.} 14. c5 {Not a very good move that I just played.} Be7 {Besides Knight forks, my worst enemy in this game is twin Bishops.} 15. Bd2 Qa5 {Good bye my misused pawn.} 16. Qe1 Bxc5 17. Nxe5 {I'm trying to wake up now, with a threat on c6!} Bd6 {I guess Black thought a double check was useful and I respond by taking his already bored (board) pawn.} 18. Nxc6 Qc7 19. Nxb4 {My Knight is probably happy, but his hapiness is already in a deadly storm.} Bxb3 {The Bishop's Revenge.} 20. Ra3 {Do we have any room for the Rook to move about?} Be6 {Now is a good time for my Rook to go back to it's starting place: a1.} 21. b3 a5 22. Nb2 O-O {Black decides to castle while I am in pain.} 23. f4 Bxb4 24. Bxb4 axb4 25. Rxa8 Rxa8 {Maybe I should try to play 26.Nc4.} 26. e5 Nd5 27. Qe4 {What am I doing? Now, Black can play 27...Qc3.} Qc2 {Or this move is just as great.} 28. Qxd4 {I only took Black's d4 pawn to have my Queen quickly guard as much material as it can, preferably my Knight and my d3 pawn.} Qxb3 29. Nc4 Ra2 30. Ra1 {My only move to save me!} Nxf4 {Black destroys his game entirely!!!} 31. Qd8# {A stunning mate came right into play thanks to Black's weak back rank and the file that unfolds into an open rank. At first sight, it was hard for me to believe that it was really possible. }
