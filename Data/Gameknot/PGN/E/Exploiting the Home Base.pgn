[Opening "Centre game (C21)"]

1. e4 e5 {Most common moves as far as I'm concerned.} 2. d4 {This is the Center Game, an opening that was another opening said to have been lost in the shadows of the Ruy Lopez. I will make sure that it comes back alive in this game if I can win (not that it matters if I win).} Qf6 {Throw this move into the waste-bucket! 2...exd4 is significantly better.} 3. Be3 {Not the best effort, but still sufficient enough to solid development.} Nh6 {Here's a poem: If a Knight's on the rim, it's future is grim; it's chances of survival are very slim. My advice: don't develop the Knight on the edge when the Queen is out; wait for the Queen to move away from the Knight's square, then move the Knight. Right now, I can win a point, but I think that it is too risky at this moment.} 4. Nf3 {I continue my development, therefore.} Bb4+ {No problem because of 5.Nc3. The problem is that I might not want to unpin the Kinght until my King is castled.} 5. c3 {Certainly not the best. However, this doesn't mean that the Knight cannot develop. How I wish that I found d5 now?} Ba5 6. dxe5 {Well, I guess I could do that. } Qg6 {I believe that Black thinks that if I can win a pawn, he can win one when he wants.} 7. Nbd2 {Now would be a good time to create space for my pieces.} O-O {?! This move makes Black's Queen look absolutely ridiculous on it's spot. Perhaps Qe6 before castling could make things look better for Black.} 8. g3 {Unreasonable. 8.Bc4 is preferred.} Nc6 {This move can be bothersome. If I played Bc4 then he played this move, it will be an absolute blunder! Better was 8...Qe6.} 9. Nh4 Qe6 {So far, so good...temporary. } 10. f4 {I knew Black was going for 10...Nxe5. Therefore, I played this move. I am influenced to watch out for LS weaknesses.} f6 {A disasterous blunder! Better was the simple 10...d6.} 11. Bc4 {Black should just play 11...Kh8.} Ng4 {This move is a careless move that says,"I already played d6, and now I'll wait for that puny Queen to come after me." Of course, that was off the hook compared to Kh8, losing less points.} 12. Bxe6+ {Good-bye Knight.} dxe6 {Only best move.} 13. Qxg4 {This event actually tested to see if, in this position, Black can Castle without taking risks? As I evaluated,"For every move, there are advantages and disadvantages. If they are equal, then it is an okay move. If a move is a bit more of a disadvantage, then it is an inaccurate move. If there are more diadvantages, then it is a mistake. If there is only one advantage (which applies only if the opponent makes the one ridiculous move), then it is a blunder. However, if there are more advantages than disadvantages, then it'll likely be a definite good move.  In that case, think about your moves and their purposes and think of them as your advantages. Then, look at your opponents' pieces and decide if he has moves to play against you and put those as the disadvantages. Analyze, then find out for yourself if what you want to move will be a good move or not.} fxe5 {I might want to Castle now to counterattack this move.} 14. f5 {Well, maybe I should have Castled before playing this move, but I think it works.} exf5 {I think Black is experimenting with my position (not a good idea at all).} 15. exf5 {Looks like Queenside Castling is a bit safer.} b5 {15...Rf7 looks better due to my next move.} 16. Bh6 {! This move pins the pawn to 2 targets and makes 16...Rf7 Black's only move!} Rf7 {What else could Black play? Absolutely nothing!} 17. O-O {18.Rae1 looks good for White. Unfortunately for Black, the pawn is still pinned indirectly to his Rook. Developing his LSB is probably his only chance...} Bb6+ {...It looks like my King is better off in the corner.} 18. Kh1 {Black will want to do the same too.} Kf8 {I don't know why Black wants to hinder his Queenside development, but this move makes 19.Ne4 seem winning for White.} 19. Ng6+ {? What does this accomplish? Better was 19.Nf3, Ne4, and a variety of other moves.} hxg6 20. Bxg7+ {I don't really like this move either.} Kxg7 {? What was Black thinking, sitting in the open unsafe letting my Quenn mercilessly destroy four more points? I don't know what other move Black had to get away from what is coming up, but this is definitely not his best move.} 21. Qxg6+ Kf8 22. Qxc6 Rb8 {Let the King chase commence. Of course, I have to think it out, but I think I play some unthoughtful moves.} 23. Qh6+ {There's one place Black is eyeing at to take shelter in: the Queenside.} Ke7 {24.f6+ looks fine with the exception of making Black's Queenside seem like a great home for Black's King.} 24. f6+ Ke6 {Don't worry about your Rook, Black. I'll make sure I won't capture it (maybe; it depends on what I need to do which depends on where Black moves).} 25. Ne4 {Threatening 26.Ng5+} Bb7 {Change of plans...} 26. Qh3+ {Black's Queenside, after his most recent move, is used uselessly by the LSB, trying to gain something out of this lost game. This means that Black has no other chances of being safe again, forever. } Kd5 {Now, I'll make sure that Black has no chance of turning the tides.} 27. Rfe1 Kc4 {These next moves are forced, I think.} 28. b3+ Kd5 {This move wasn't forced, but moving to my Queenside is equally dangerous.} 29. Rad1+ {Only move gets Black checkmated.} Kc6 {There's the "only move". Here comes the checkmate.} 30. Qe6# {Instead of the losing move 25...Bb7, how about if Black played 25...Bd7 to leave an escape square for his King and make that "escape square" a home for then? Well, even if he did, this same position is likely to occur except that I get to take the Rook after Black's move. This is a great example of how to lose an escape square in King chases. Make sure to keep an eye out for possible escape squares and make sure that if you can make one and use it in time, you use it wisely. However, every lesson we learn about chess is based on the question, "Are you thinking about where you move and use your time wisely, or are you making a bunch of moves that are saying, 'I hope you do this'?" If you're admitting that you made a bunch of random moves (referring to the question above), you are playing a chess coach's most disliked game of Hope Chess. I have to admit, it is the most miserable, excruciatingly painful and hopeless game anyone ever plays. To close this up, please avoid playing Hope Chess. }
