1. c4 {This is probably the most aggressive and risky game I have played for a long time. It happened in my Halibut gambit tournament.} b5 {Starting position} 2. cxb5 a6 3. Nc3 axb5 4. e4 {This is surely a mistake.} b4 5. Nd5 c5 {I think I would have been tempted by e6.} 6. d4 e6 {It was around this point that I decided to go for it. I think having such an advanced position for my knight went to my head and I thought I could see all sorts of possibilities. } 7. Bg5 {Obviously if the queen takes the bishop I can fork King and rook with my knight and may get to develop my remaining knight with tempo to f3} f6 8. Nxf6+ {Against a player ranked so much higher than me this is a high risk gambit.} Nxf6 {I was hoping for (though not expecting) gxf6 as I then have Qh5+ } 9. e5 {Trying to maintain the pressure on black.} h6 10. exf6 {I didn't want to retreat the bishop as g5 might follow if I did and that would give black advanced pawns on the kings side where I was looking to castle in future} hxg5 11. f7+ {Black may have been expecting fxg7 but I have another plan which will regain my lost material and possibly more, the bonus with this was that black couldn't castle - not that he was likely to now} Kxf7 {Black can't afford to leave one of my pawns so far advanced so has little choice} 12. Qf3+ Qf6 13. Qxa8 {Suddenly I am ahead on material with the chance of more. Black can no longer castle and  and I need to work out how to take advantage of the position} Qxd4 {I was really expecting something like Bd6 here, though black was trying to keep his advanced pawns together, they could still yet prove a thorn in my side.} 14. Rd1 {I'm still not sure that the simple Qxb8 wouldn't have been better here, in the end I decided to keep trying to pressure black. I figured that he would be tempted with Qxb2 partly to equalise on material but also because it means that his c and b pawns look a lot more threatening then.} Qxb2 15. Bb5 {Looking to develop here but again the simple Qxb8 or Nf3 may have been better. I wanted to preserve my a pawn as I may need it to keep the black pawns back a little. } Qe5+ 16. Kf1 {I didn't want to block as I wanted to develop my knight to f3 threatening check with Nxg5} Qc7 17. Qf3+ {With blacks queen there my queen is better off somewhere else. I wanted to try to keep black under pressure} Kg8 {This works well for me as I still have my lsb and am hoping to make good use of it} 18. Nh3 {Aiming at g5 with the simple threat of Qf7} Bb7 19. Qb3 {This foils my immediate plan but now I am looking at another. If I can get my knight to g5 then a sacrifice on d7 could be nasty for black with Qxe6 threatened} Bxg2+ {I'd completely missed this nice move which allows black to gain a pawn} 20. Kxg2 Qb7+ 21. f3 Qxb5 22. Nxg5 {I am very happy with my knight here} c4 23. Qe3 Qa6 {Black now wants my a pawn so that he can escape but I think this is a blunder} 24. Qf4 {reverts to my earlier threat of Qf7#, as far as I can see the only way to slow this down is something like ... Qxa2+, Rd2, Qxd2, Qxd2 with more material loss to follow. } Qxa2+ 25. Kf1 {Now things are really looking up for me, black cannot check and I have mate in one} Rh6 {I don't understand this move, I guess he was looking at Rf6 and had missed my threat.} 26. Qf7+ {Thanks for reading please comment.}
