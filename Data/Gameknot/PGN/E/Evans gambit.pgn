1. e4 {I have only recently started playing the Evans Gambit, but it has quickly become one of my favourite openings as i'm a bit of a risk taker and it compliments my style of play. Hope you enjoy the game :) } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {d3 can be considered here, but where is the fun in that? i'll play b4 everytime :)} Bxb4 {This is the usuall reply. Black could decline the gambit but this is seen as inferior due to the lost of tempo and nothing gained.} 5. c3 {c3 chases the bishop away forcing it to move for a 3rd time in just the first 5 moves, although black is compensated by having the pawn advantage.} Ba5 {Ba5 is the most common move, Be7 is another alternative.} 6. d4 {Whites bishops can become very strong later on in the game. d4 gives them move room to manouver while also contesting the center.} exd4 7. O-O {Nxd4!? is an option here as it stops black from gaining any extra pawns. This however would allow black the chance to castle after 7. ....Nf6  8. 0-0 Nxd4  9. Qxd4 0-0. Or even cxd4 as a different option. Personally i prefer to give black the chance to take the 3rd pawn as i'd rather black did not castle.} dxc3 8. Qb3 {No rush to take the pawn back just yet. Instead i focus on blacks weak points f7 and b7.} Qf6 9. e5 {By advancing the pawn, black must move their queen again to maintain their advantage. Black is not going to play Nxe5 as whites next move would be Re1! pinning the knight to the king and so giving white the edge.} Qf5 10. Nxc3 Nge7 11. Ba3 {The bishop is now on a very strong diagonal. Black could castle but it would leave their knight pinned to the rook...} Ng6 {but by moving the knight it opens up the diagonal.} 12. Rad1 Ngxe5 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. Nd5 c6 {f6 is better as it maintains blacks advantage. c6 leaves the game in the balance after 15. Qg3 focusing on the weak pawn but....} 15. Ne7 {I don't like playing for draws, Ne7 is quite risky as it allows for some complicated continuations and also forces the queen to move again.} Qg4 16. Rfe1 {Rfe1!? I can see the potential of controlling this file and i am prepared to exchange my rook for blacks bishop to get it. Black is pretty much forced to play Bxe1 as there isn't really any better alternative.} Bxe1 17. Rxe1 {Although white is down the exchange and a few pawns. white can pull the game level. Black's knight is stuck on e5 because if it moves it leaves black open to a discovered check after either Nxc6  or Nxc8  17.....Nf3  is not an option either as after  18. Qxf3 Qxf3 19. Nxc6  Qe4  20. Rxe4        or (18.....Qxc4 19. Nd5  Kd8 20. Be7  Ke8 21. Nc7  )} Qg5 {Black spotted this but played Qg5?? protecting the knight. Blacks best move would have been d6 instead, but that allows white to draw level and with blacks numerical advantage perphaps they did not want to settle for this.} 18. Nxc8 Rxc8 {Blacks best alternative was is Kd8, but after Be7  it loses the queen.} 19. Qxb7 {Black resigns as to avoid mate black has to give up alot of material. 19.... Kd8 20. Ba6 Nf3  21. Kh1 Qxg2  22. Kxg2 Nxe1  23. Kg3 c5 24. Qxc8  etc....  I'd like to say thanks to Magicking for the game, and i look forward to the return game where i am certain he'll show how strong the Evans gambit is too :)}
