[Opening "Sicilian defence (B40)"]

1. e4 c5 {The engine doesn't invariably play the Sicilian, but does so more often than not.  The other day it played an Owen Defence (1...b6!?), and i have seen other first moves tried...} 2. Nf3 e6 {This is also Black's 'favorite', though the other day it played an 'Ultra-fianchetto': 2...g6!?} 3. c4 {(!?) Something out of left field from me.  Far more common is 3.d4.  Against that the engine often played the Kann System, with ...a6 and ...Qc7.} Nc6 {Immediately staking his claim on the d4-square.  White hopes his light square hold will be the stronger and more decisive.} 4. d3 {4.d4 was actually playable...} d6 {Possibly with the view to locking up the centre by ...e5, but this never eventuates.} 5. Nc3 Bd7 6. Be2 {White could fianchetto the Bishop via g2 (after 6.g3, naturally!), but I wanted to save a bit of time.} Nd4 {Going after the exchange of minor pieces.  I probably ought to have exchanged on d4 (7.Nxd4 ) but, again, preferred to preserve time.} 7. O-O {Willing to exchange my 'bad' bishop for Black's active knight...} Nxe2+ {(?!) I consider this exchange to be dubious, as it is my less useful bishop, and at the moment his more useful knight.  But in playing the knight to d4, Black had pretty much committed himself.} 8. Qxe2 Be7 {By developing the bishop ahead of the knight, Black dissuades White from playing a minor piece to g5.  Not that I particularly wanted to move anything to g5, but at least Black doesn't have to worry about weakening the K-side by ...h6.  But a few moves later he (I'll use a personal pronoun rather than the impersonal) played that pawn move anyway...} 9. Be3 {a fine spot for the bishop.  Black's knight is in no position to challenge this bishop's posting.} Nf6 10. Nd2 {A 'dual purpose' move.  It's primary intent is to free the f-pawn to advance.  It also prevents ...Ng4, so the e3-bishop will not be molested where he stands.} O-O 11. f4 b6 {Intending, possibly, to force an advance on the Q-side.  } 12. Nf3 {(?!) I don't like this move much, on reflection.  The idea is OK, but could have been better timed.  Instead 12.g4 deserved more consideration than I gave it.} h6 {Preventing Ng5, but I wasn't planning that move for a while yet.  It (...h6) tends to weaken Black's K-side slightly.} 13. h3 {Deciding that I wanted to keep the bishop on e3, I make sure the enemy knight is not going to make a nuisance of himself (...Ng4).} Bc6 {Preparing ...d5, maybe?} 14. g4 {Beginning a general pawn advance against the Black King.} Re8 15. f5 exf5 {I did think he might try ...e5, but this capture was no real surprise.  White has a fine game at the moment.} 16. gxf5 {Capturing 'towards the centre'.  There are several reasons for this: 1.  It keeps the centre strong and closed; 2. an opened e-file would be much more useful to Black; 3. The half-opened g-file is very much in White's interest.  The fight develops into Black's effort to preserve the balance by attacking on the Q-side and in the centre; whilst White attacks the King directly and tries to hold the centre closed.} Qc8 {(!?) A little bit of a puzzle, this move.  It seems to involve some vague notion of attack against h3, or maybe the light squares on the Q-side.  Later on it infiltrates White's game via a6 and becomes a bit of an annoyance.} 17. Nd5 {Offering to exchange knights.  I had no particular intention to exchange on f6 or e7 myself, but rather keep the knight on d5 if Black didn't exchange, just to keep the tension and tie up the centre.} Nxd5 {Unsurprisingly, Black exchanges knights.  I think it prefers the bishops.} 18. cxd5 {Of course. I don't want to open the e-file.  This does leave a bit of a weak point at d3, which Black at once seeks to exploit.} Bb5 {Striking at d3.  This has to be taken seriously, as after ...Bf6, Black will have several nasty threats against the compromised center, e.g.: 19.Rad1?! Bf6!  20.b3 Rxe4! or 20.Qg2 Qa6 and Black will have wrested the initiative from White.  What, then , should White do now?} 19. a4 {Hitting the Bishop.  If it drops back to a6, at least the Queen can't come to its support in attack.} Bd7 {(!?) I really did expect 19...Ba6, here.   There were a number of replies I could have made to that (Rd1, Ra3, Kh1, Qd2) but I didn't have to make the decision.  For the moment the pressure against White's centre has eased.} 20. Qg2 {Threatens 21.Bxh6.} h5 {(?!) I did not expect this!  I thought Black would simply move the King over to the h-file.  21.Bh6 is still playable, but there is little point after 21...Bf6.} 21. Kh1 {Preparing to bring a rook in behind the Queen.} Qa6 {The expected counter-attack!  The threat is ...Qxd3, and undermine White e-pawn and the whole central position.  The battle is becoming more intense...} 22. Rfg1 {For the moment the d-pawn is safe: White threatens a direct mate.  Recall last time I mentioned the role of short-range threats that, though easily contained in themselves, yet can help to make progress one way or another.  The mate in one is stopped easily, but it preserves the White centre for an extra move whilst at the same time reinforces the attack down the g-file.} Bf6 {Among other things, this threatens ...Bxf5.  White's centre pawns are coming under enormous pressure, as are the dark squares.  There is a battle royal going on now that spans the whole width of the board.} 23. Bh6 {Throwing everything into the direct attack.  Which will prevail?} Qxd3 {White's central phalanx starts to crumble...} 24. Bxg7 {Threatening another quick mate!  Now the game escalates into a tactical melee...} Bxf5 {Desperation?  The fact is that the threatened discovered check is so strong that Black requires extreme measures to defend.  This represents his best chance, but it ought not to be quite enough...} 25. Bxf6+ {(!) Best, but 25.exf5 was almost as playable: 26.exf5 Re2  27.Qxe2! Qxe2  28.Bxf6ch Kf8  29.Ng5! Qd3 (say, to try and check White's King) 30. Nh7ch Ke8  31.Nh7ch Ke8  32.Re1ch and mate in a couple more moves.} Bg6 {White has won a piece, but the centre is still as much a battleground as the K-side.} 26. Ng5 {Protects the e-pawn.  Black can not capture it even with 3 attackers against 2, as he must at all costs keep the g-file closed.} Kf8 {Freeing up the bishop to take on e4.  The g-file pin is not so effective now, as the captures on e4 set up a counter pin on the light long diagonal.  } 27. Rad1 {(!?) Good enough, as 27...Bxe4  28.Rxd3 Bxg2ch  29.Rxg2 wins a second piece for White.  I have a feeling that 27.Re1 was a better option, though.} Qc4 {Keeping the pressure up against e4.} 28. Ne6+ {(!) All out attack!  Will Black take the knight, or has the king once more to endure the hazards of the g-file?} Kg8 {I was expecting ...Rxe6, actually, though that loses the exchange with White's attack still ongoing.   Instead, ...fxe6 was immediately hopeless as 29.Qxg6 led to a quick checkmate.} 29. Rde1 {Concerned about the centre, White reinforces it.  The eye was drawn to the possibility of 29.Qxg6ch but after 29...fxg6 30.Rxg6ch Kf7, White has insufficient attack.} Qxa4 {(??) As it transpired, this allowed the attack I rejected the previous move.  I did give it a quick glance once again, but not thoroughly enough...} 30. Qg5 {(!?)  The intention is, of course, 31.Qh6 and 32.Qg7#, but was this the best White could play?  It depends on whether Black had a viable defence.  The alternative line was this (temporary) Queen sacrifice: 30.Qxg6ch!? fxg6  31.Rxg6ch Kf7  32.Rg7ch!!  Kxf6  33.Rf1ch ... (This move was not available whilst the Queen stood at c4.)  33... Ke5  34. Rg5ch! Kxe4  35.Rf4ch Ke3  36.Rg3ch Ke2 37.Rxa4, with an extra knight for two pawns, and the Black king isolated and alone behind enemy lines.} Kh7 {For a horrible moment I thought White's attack had come to an end, right here.  But a half-minute's thought unearthed what followed...} 31. Qxh5+ {BAM! Giving away a Queen for a mere pawn? The Black King will be subjected to a ferocious attack.} Bxh5 {Forced.  This is one Queen sac that won't be declined!} 32. Rg7+ Kh8 {Not 32...Kh6 as 33.Bg5# seals the deal.} 33. Rxf7+ {What follows is an example, albeit short lived, of a windmill.} Kg8 34. Rg7+ Kh8 35. Rxa7+ {Rubbing it in - rather wasted on the machine, but... well... Instead 35.Re7 would have been equally effective.} Kg8 36. Rg1+ Bg6 37. Rxg6# {It is not often one gets to play out a sound Queen sacrifice that leads to a forced mate.  It is an opportunity not to be missed when it comes your way!  It is quite an economical checkmate, too: all 4 White pieces contribute.}
