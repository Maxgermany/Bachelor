1. c4 d5 2. cxd5 {The Exchange variation. Can be boring and therefore drawish. For more interest, try 2. e3 or 2. Nf3.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Nxd5 4. Nf3 Bg4 {A Trompowski-type move, so I meet it as I do a Tromp-proper.} 5. g3 Bxf3 6. exf3 Nxc3 7. bxc3 Qd5 8. d4 e6 9. Bg2 Qc4 10. Qb3 Qxb3 11. axb3 {Queens gone, two pairs of minor pieces gone, neither side developed: this game seems destined to drift toward a lifeless draw.} c5 {? -- This weakens b7 severely, and will come back to haunt Black shortly. Better Was 11. ...c6 which neither impedes Black's KB nor the Knight's eventual development to d7.} 12. Be3 Nd7 13. O-O Be7 14. Ra2 {I've got a half-open file, so I may as well at least threaten to use it for something.} a6 15. f4 Rb8 16. f5 {! -- Taking advantage of Black's weakness on his Q-side diagonals. Suddenly Black is in difficulty.} O-O 17. Bf4 Rbd8 18. Bxb7 cxd4 19. cxd4 {Keeps Black's Knight inactive.} exf5 20. Bc7 Rde8 21. Rxa6 Bf6 22. d5 {! -- Passed pawns must be pushed!} Nc5 23. Rb6 Nxb7 24. Rxb7 Re7 {Black wants to play ...Rc8 next, but it's too slow.} 25. d6 Rd7 26. Re1 Bc3 27. Re7 Rxe7 28. dxe7 Re8 29. Rb8 {Brings down the curtain. But Black needs a little more convincing.} Rxb8 30. Bxb8 {Black resigns.}
