1. c4 {My favourite English Opening.} e5 {A standard response.} 2. Nc3 {I used to move 2.g3 but employ the more cautious 2.Nc3 now.} Nc6 {Nf6 is more usual but this is not a bad move.} 3. g3 {I could have moved Nf3 either.} Nf6 {Nf6 this time - still the most common response to 3.g3 per the GameKnot DB.} 4. Bg2 {I've started so I might as well finish, although the Games BD prefers Nf3} d6 {The first departure from the orthodox response.  The Games DB insists that Bb4 or Bc5 offer better prospects.  d6 blocks the black bishop in} 5. d3 {I get nervous leaving c4 unprotected.  For the 3rd move in a row the Games DB is heckling me to move Nf3 instead!} Bg4 {This is aggressive -looking but won't achieve much unsupported.  Games DB prefers Be7} 6. Qa4 {I want to put some pressure on the c6 knight} Qd7 {This supports the knight, blocks a potential check and sets up Bh3.  So that's all good, right?} 7. Bg5 {I don't see any point in Nf3 now.  I want to keep pressure on the c6 knight.  I could play Bxc6 to force bxc6 (with or without a queen exchange) and stuff his pawns up.  But I want to keep the threat alive for now.  Bg5 is also threatening to double-up his pawns} Nh5 {Black has little choice unless he meekly retreats back to g8.  I think Be7 would have been better.  Still, black must think that he has an attack building on the kingside} 8. h3 {I want that bishop out of there.  h5 is now blocked and retreating to e6 will further constrict his development} Bf5 {An unexpected bonus because...} 9. g4 {...that's a nasty fork!} Nf4 {Black appears to be able to limit the damage to 1 point here by  9...Bxg4 10.hxg4 Qxg4 Unfortunately 11.Bxc6+ bxc6 (forced, as Kd8 is prevented and 11...Qd7 12.Bxd7#) 12.Qxc6+ Qd7 (forced) 13.Qxa8+ Qc8 (followed by 14.Qxc8#) or Qd8 (followed by Qxd8#) [See puzzle #21064]} 10. Bxf4 {I considered gxf5 hoping for Qxf5 and a different version of my forced mate in 5.  However Nxg2+ would wreck that} exf4 11. gxf5 {Taking a 3-point lead} Be7 {Black needs to develop pieces and castle his king out of immediate trouble} 12. Nd5 {So I ratchet up the pressure a little.  This move threatens the bishop on e7 and also the pawns at c7 & f4.  It gives black a number of problems 12...O-O 13.Nxe7+ Qxe7 14.Bxc6 winning a pawn  12...O-O 13.Nxe7+ Nxe7 14.Qxd7 winning the queen  13....Ne5 or Nd4 14.Nxc7+  The queen is pinned and can't move so Kd8. White can exchange queens & retreat the knight, having won a pawn and ruined black's castle  13...O-O-O 14.Nxe7+ Nxe7 15.Qxa7 Qxf5 (the only way to avoid Qa8# or losing the queen) 16.Qxb7+ Kd7 and white is another pawn up  In fact 12...Bg5 was just about the only response I could see that didn't involve immediate extra problems.  I would probably have responded 13.Nf3} Qxf5 {Well, of all his options this was one of the worst.  Sure it wins a pawn, but at what cost?} 13. Nxc7+ {Nxe7 Kxe7 wrecks his castle but I'm after bigger game} Kd8 {I think Kd7 was better.  It protected the knight on c6 and allowed an immediate Rxa8 response} 14. Nxa8 {8 points up but black should be able to re-take the knight if he plays his cards right} Re8 {Which he doesn't!  I understand that this move is trying to develop his remaining rook, but as we shall see blocking the king from e8 will prove to be disasterous.  Black's priority should be to take the vulnerable white knight on a8.  Qc8 both protects c6 and threatens a8} 15. Bxc6 {OK, at last it's time for Bxc6} bxc6 16. Qxa7 {Both Qxc6 and Qxa7 threaten Qc7#  Qxa7 stops 16...Qa5+ which puts white in check and protects c7} Qc8 {16...Rf8 was the only way to avoid a hasty end  16...Qd7, seeking an exchange of queens, could also have worked.  But black would have had to be careful of traps such as: 16...Qd7 17.Qb6+ Qc7 18.Qxc7#  16...Qd7 17.Qb6+ Kc8 18.Qa6+ Kd8 19.Nb6 (threatens Q but also Qc8#) Qf5 20.Qa8+ Kc7 21.Qxe8   } 17. Nb6 {Hanging the black queen to avoid immediate mate  Qa1, Qb1, Qa6 all lead to an immediate Qd7# Qd7 Qxd7# Qb7 Qxb7 and Qd7# next turn can't be avoided Qc7 Qa8+, then Qb8 Qxb8# or Qc8 Qxc8# Qe6 or Qf5 leads to Qb8+ (not Qa8+ to block Kc7) then Qc8 Qxc8#   So Bg5 is about the only way to avoid mate in 3 or less} Qe6 {The fat lady is singing} 18. Qb8+ {And it's goodnight from him. 18...Qc8 19.Qxc8#  I never did get to move Nf3!!!}
