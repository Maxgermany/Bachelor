[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {Yes, I still refuse to play 1. e4. Never have. Ever. Some day I must I know, but right now Caesar is just going to get my bread and butter.} Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 {KID. Seen it a million times I'm just praying to get out of the opening equal.} Nc6 {Always a dicey choice for black right here methinks. Bg4 or even Nbd7 seems more natural.} 7. d5 {Punishing that knight's impudence correctly.} Nb8 {Where else? It seems to me that Na5 is awful, and Nb4 only helps white expand on the queenside.} 8. O-O e5 {Establishing a strong central presence, and probably hoping I'll take e.p.} 9. Bd2 Ne8 {? Now I'm kind of tortured. What in the world is he up to? I've never seen Caesar play so passively. I immediately look for a mating net on my king:) OK Caesar......I'll drink the Kool Aid.......} 10. Qc1 {I want his DSB.} f5 {!? It had to be done, but not sure if this move was timed correctly.} 11. Bh6 f4 {Fine by me. I get my prize and reach a pretty closed position (which I prefer over open games).} 12. Bxg7 Kxg7 13. g3 {! this move served two masters....1, it picks away at the tip of black's sword and 2, it continually punishes black's lack of development. With his king on the g file, I hope to rip it open and flood major pieces up it.} g5 {?! Either he doesn't see what I'm up to, or he has some faulty intel. I think this only assists white.} 14. gxf4 gxf4 15. Kh1 Kh8 16. Rg1 {All righty then! Only 16 moves in and I'm digging my position. King is safe, pieces far better developed than black, and I own a file.} h6 {FOR SALE: Prime real estate around the black king. 15 minutes from downtown. Great school district.} 17. Rg6 Kh7 18. Qg1 {And I begin thinking uber aggressive thoughts. No kidding, my blood pressure was pounding. I actually have a shot to beat Caesar for the first time. I pray for patience, as I know he never gives up.......} Rf6 19. Nh4 {Surprise:)} Qe7 {Black sees immediate threats around his king, and maneuvers to protect. Has the time for development been lost for black?} 20. Bh5 Ng7 21. Bg4 Nd7 {Finally, but at what cost?} 22. Nf5 Nxf5 23. Bxf5 {YIKES! That just happened! I win the Exchange!} Rxf5 24. exf5 Nf8 {Ok, black's position is loosening up. I have a material advantage that I want to take to the the next level ASAP. Time to encourage trades and press the attack.} 25. f6 Nxg6 {Black capitulates. I'm quite sure my good buddy Caesar is relying on his endgame experience advantage. I'll continue to sip the Kool Aid.} 26. fxe7 Nxe7 27. Qg2 Bf5 28. Nb5 {I'm thinking that this knight will be my chief pawn gobbler, so I set him up for success.} Rg8 29. Qf3 {I considered QxR for about .045 seconds. Grow up Thomas. Play correctly.} Rg7 30. Rg1 Ng6 {Black still has game, even though down in material. The light squares are open for business, and he still has his LSB.} 31. Nxa7 Nh4 32. Rxg7+ {Of course I'll accept immediate simplification. I realize that victory is sight if I can just hold it together.} Kxg7 33. Qh5 {Just hitting as much as possible knowing full well I'm gonna have to sidestep a few checks.} Be4+ 34. Kg1 Nf3+ 35. Kf1 Nd2+ 36. Ke2 Nxc4 37. Qg4+ Kf6 38. Qe6+ Kg5 {Black has bet the farm on his h pawn.} 39. h4+ Kh5 40. Nb5 Nxb2 41. Nxc7 Bd3+ {I take perhaps my longest think of the game here. Black is now poised to run connected passers down my throat. Can I survive the immediate danger and get my knight into an attack? I think so.} 42. Kf3 e4+ 43. Kxf4 {Mate in 1.} Be2 {Forced.} 44. Qxd6 Kxh4 45. Qf6+ Kh3 46. Qxh6+ Kg2 47. Qh4 {As I am well stocked up on tempo, I can afford to give a little back in order to get my knight involved. Plus, I still have the option of running my d pawn. My heart is pounding audibly.} Bf3 48. Qg3+ Kf1 49. Nb5 Nd1 50. Nd6 Nc3 51. Ke5 b6 52. Nc4 Nxa2 {? White can now race for promotion.} 53. d6 Nb4 54. d7 Nc6+ 55. Kd6 Nd8 56. Nxb6 Be2 57. Ke7 Nc6+ 58. Kf8 {No more checks Caesar. Time to bring it on home.} Nd8 59. Nd5 Bb5 60. Nf6 Bc6 61. Qc7 {! I loved this move. } Ne6+ 62. Ke7 Nxc7 63. d8=Q Nb5 64. Qb6 {Black's LSB is trapped. He's gonna lose SOMETHING.} Be8 65. Nxe8 Nc3 66. Qd4 Ne2 67. Qe3 Ke1 68. f4 {The final dagger. Black has to take.} exf3 e.p. 69. Qxf3 Kd2 70. Nf6 Kd1 71. Ne4 Ke1 72. Qh1+ {....and black resigns. Give it up to the 'D' players of the world! Even a mighty Caesar can be taken down!}
