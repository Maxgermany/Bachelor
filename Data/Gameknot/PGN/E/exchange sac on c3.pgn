1. Nf3 {Reti Opening} d5 2. d4 {Now basically a transposition from 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 which I am perfectly fine with} Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 4. a3 {A little bit too prophylatic IMO. White wastes a move guarding a square which I might haven't even put the bishop on.} c5 {getting the typical strike on c5,usual in all Queen's pawn openings} 5. Be3 {I would prefer 5.e3 because the Bishop looks awkward here. But it does threaten c5} cxd4 {so I take the pawn. An interesting (and good) continuation would be 5...b6 planning to fianchetto the Bishop on b7 and keep the active center.} 6. Bxd4 Nc6 7. e3 Nxd4 {interesting that the comp. gives this as a mistake. I would prefer this move. I win the two bishops} 8. Nxd4 Bd6 {Both sides are developing their pieces quietly} 9. Bd3 O-O 10. Ndb5 a6 {interesting that I would gain the two bishops only to give them back. Indeed,I didn't follow my plan but I really shouldn't waste time retreating my Bishop} 11. Nxd6 Qxd6 12. Qe2 {clearing the back rank and not giving away where he will castle} Bd7 {developing the final piece. Things look very boring and equal} 13. Qf3 {why would he waste two moves moving it there when he could've just taken one? wastes a tempo} Rac8 {putting the rook on the semi-open file } 14. O-O-O {? looks safe but things aren't what they seem!} Rxc3 {! I played this quickly and intuitively. It just looked right. and I calculated lines later and my intuitions did not let me down} 15. bxc3 {no turning back now} Qxa3+ {Things on the Queenside break down and the king has to flee} 16. Kd2 {the alternative 16.Kb1 Qxc3 is good for Black. with a minor piece and two pawns(one of them passed) and a rook ready to swing over to help,White needs to be very careful} Rd8 {The comp. gives 16...Rc8 as best but I disagree! White loses the pawn on c3 and is fine,but the move played aims more at the King and gives a big advantage to Black!  there is no way to stop the threat of 17...Ne4+} 17. h4 {Again there is no way to stop 17...Ne4+. And the computer "improvement" 17.Qf4 leads to the same result! 17...Ne4+! and it leads to the same motifs as the line played. } Ne4+ {The crushing move. White must at least lose material} 18. Bxe4 {?? This loses immediately, although 18.Ke1 Nxc3 is not pleasant for White} dxe4 19. Qg3 {avoiding 19.Qxe4 Bc6+ but that is still better than what happened!} Bb5+ {Its all over} 20. Ke1 {Mate in 2} Qxc3+ 21. Rd2 Qxd2# {Thanks for viewing my game. Comments and analysis are very welcome}
