1. e4 {Capturing En Passant is what this tutorial is about.} d5 {d5, if e4 captures df black's queen would go WAM!! and be knocked of the board, but if black captures white, no consequence.} 2. e5 {a way to bock the treat, not the wisest, but a way.} f5 {A way to protect the pawn to get any further. If e5 moves e6, its stuck. Two reason's that move is not the best: 1. moving to be6 would've stopped it, no choice, frozen. 2. Obviosly, the player doesn't know En Passant.} 3. exf6 e.p. {There you go, En Passant!
