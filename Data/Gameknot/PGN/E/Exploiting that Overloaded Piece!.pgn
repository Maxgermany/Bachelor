1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I have just returned from a nice holiday in sunny Bognor Regis - the last 3 days have been lovely with the sea at West Wittering being like a Turkish Bath.  Well, after that relaxing break it is time to catch up on my moves and do a bit more annotating.  I have been giving considerable thought to the feedback I received after my last annotation.  I was so chuffed with the new toy Gameknot Analysis that I thought I would use it.  However, with the use of it it started to detract from useful comments, so much so that my previous annotation was as impressive as the United Kingdom's performance in the Eurovision Song Contest.  I will remedy this by posting the Gameknot Analysis Version here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13490591&rnd=0.09771577577484708 and give normal commentary from now on.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - here are some pretty standard moves of the Sicilian Defense.  Am I gonna get the Naijdorf or the Dragon?  I have mixed results from both these systems.} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {5. ...... a6 - hmm, the Naijdorf.} 6. Be3 {6. Be3 - enter Fou Lenoir!  I am keeping my options open as to where to put Henry so I am clearing the decks as quickly as possible.} e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3 Be7 9. Qd2 {9. Qd2 - this system is transposing into the Fisher-Byrne Attack.  Glenda is eyeing up the backward pawn on d6 with interest.  Next move I will castle queenside and pile up on that little footman.} O-O 10. O-O-O a5 {10. ........ a5 - hmm, who's attacking who?} 11. Bb5 {11. Bb5 - Fou Leblanc develops to b5 and tries to halt the advance of the queenside pawns.  I have yet to build a counter-attack on the other wing though.} Nbd7 12. Qe2 Ne8 13. Kb1 {13. Kb1 - Henry bolsters the defense of the a2 pawn.} Nc7 14. Ba4 Qc8 15. h4 {15. h4 - now I start a kingside attack but will it come off?} Nf6 16. Bg5 {16. Bg5 - a pin but it is not as innocuous as it looks.....} h6 {16. .... h6? - black is oblivious to the fact that his dsb is overloaded and I am alert enough to exploit it!} 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. Rxd6 {18. Rxd6 - as a result of the overload combo I have won a pawn.} Be7 19. Rdd1 Na6 20. Nd5 {20. Nd5 - threatening to win the exchange with a fork on b6.} Bd8 21. Qb5 Bxd5 22. Qxd5 {22. Qxd5 - A white knight disappears for a black lsb.  Must be careful, opposite coloured bishops are on the board.} Nb4 23. Qd2 {23. Qd2 - hmm, must watch that black knight on b4, the Wicked Witch of the West on c8 and my pawn on c2, now who should come and defend that pawn?  Ah yes, poor put upon Glenda!} Qc4 {23. ..... Qc4 - the Wicked Witch moves in closer, aargh!} 24. Nc1 Be7 25. Bb3 {25. Bb3 - ah, but I now have a Witch Ejection Plan up my sleeve, Fou Leblanc yells "Begone you evil besom!"  The Witch flies back to c7 - I must still take care even though Henry seems well protected.  Hmm, maybe if I put up this defensive formation when playing against the Master Mater it will sentence him to a few days of head scratching!} Qc7 26. c3 Nc6 {26. .... Nc6 - now that pesky black knight is driven back.} 27. g4 b5 28. g5 Rfd8 29. Qg2 {29. Qg2 - Glenda is relieved of defensive work and moves stealthily towards the kingside.  Already she is indirectly bearing down on the black king.  I am threatening gxh6 next move.} Rd6 30. Rxd6 Qxd6 {30. ...... Qxd6 - the rook move to d6 met that threat but as I am a pawn up I decided to trade rooks.} 31. g6 {31. g6 - now putting pressure on the pinned pawn on f7.} Nd8 {31. ..... Nd8 - drat that pesky knight!} 32. Rg1 {32. Rg1 - I keep up the pressure on the g column.} Qf6 33. h5 Rb8 34. gxf7+ Nxf7 35. Qg6 Kf8 36. Qxf6 {36. Qxf6 - I decided to trade queens here as I am still a pawn up.  Gameknot suggested Qh7 however - please refer to the link in my introductory speech for further detail.} Bxf6 37. Bxf7 Kxf7 {37. ..... Kxf7 - I have avoided the opposite colour bishops but can my knight prove stronger than black's bishop?  We shall see.} 38. Nd3 {38. Nd3  - looks a good start, puts pressure on the isolani on e5 and improves the scope of the white knight.} Rc8 39. a3 Bg5 {39. .... Bg5? - an oversight dropping another pawn!  I now take immediate advantage.} 40. Nxe5+ Kf6 41. Ng6 {41. Ng6 - this knight entrenches himself on g6 to support a possible advance of my passer to e5.  Getting this pawn to Glendadom however is by no means a simple task however.} Be3 42. Rg2 b4 43. Re2 {43. Re2 - thought I would annoy the black bishop before trading queenside pawns.} Bc5 44. axb4 axb4 45. cxb4 Bxb4 {45. ..... Bxb4 - this trade has now resulted in me getting another passer on the queenside.} 46. f4 {46. f4 - this pawn move stops the black king getting to g5 and hassling my isolani on the h column.} Re8 47. Kc2 {47. Kc2 - I have a vague plan of getting Henry towards the kingside to bolster my e5 passer.  My queenside b2 passer will be used to tie black down as much as possible.} Ba5 48. Kd3 Bc7 49. Ke3 {49. Ke3 - as planned.} Rd8 50. Rd2 Rb8 {50. ..... Rb8 - putting pressure on my b2 passer.  Henry now heads for g4 but before he gets there my opponent suddenly decided that a two pawn deficit was too much and waved the white flag.  If you refer to the gameknot analysis link in my intro note you will see how big a positional advantage I had in the final.  My opponent recently held a Class A 1800+ rating like myself so I was really pleased with the result.  Hope you have had a good read - bye for now - Joanne} 51. Kf3 {}
