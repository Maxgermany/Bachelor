1. e4 {I thought I'd annotate my loss against this opponent since I annotated the win I think it's pretty interesting, for a while I had the advantage but I blundered it away Actually, for most of the game I was materially ahead, but I took a rook with my queen early on and lost the use of it for the rest of the game.} e5 2. Qh5 {Trying to get Scholar's mate. It's been used against me so many times I've memorized the responses.} Nc6 3. Bc4 {Yup, he's threatening mate in one} g6 {Stops the mate and chases the queen} 4. Qf3 {Tries again} Nf6 {Stops the threat and develops a piece} 5. c3 {Prevents Nd4 but takes away the knights favorite square.} Bc5 6. d3 d6 7. Bg5 {pins the knight, and adds another attacker} Bg4 {I though it dealt with it, but I didn't notice Qf6! winning a knight. Luckily, neither did my opponent.} 8. Qg3 O-O {Looks like it blunders away a bishop but if my opponent plays Bxf6 then I play Qxf6 Qxg4 Qxf2+ Kd1 Qf2b2} 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 10. Qxg4 Qxf2+ 11. Kd1 Qxb2 12. Nf3 Qxa1 {And I end up ahead by a rook and two pawns for a knight} 13. Kc2 {Boxing in my queen. } h5 {Probably not great, blows away more of my pawn cover} 14. Qg3 Kg7 {??????} 15. Ng5 f6 {Weakening it even more and allowing ...} 16. Ne6+ {Arrg a fork!} Kf7 {At least I get the knight} 17. Nxf8+ Kxf8 18. Qxg6 Nd8 19. Qxf6+ {The game is in white's favor now} Ke8 20. Qh8+ Kd7 21. Qxh5 Ba3 {If he takes the bishop I take the rook and if not then I can get my queen out} 22. Qh7+ {But everything stops for check} Kc8 23. Qf5+ Kb8 24. Nxa3 {Well I get the rook} Qxh1 25. Qf8 {At this point, I think I might have done best to abandon the knight and move the a pawn forward so my king can escape} Kc8 {But now, I try to keep the knight} 26. Be6+ {And I pay the price} Kb8 27. Qxd8# {...And mate. Still, a fun game and I learned from it, be careful taking rooks with you queen because your queen can be boxed in. Again, please comment.}
