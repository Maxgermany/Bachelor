1. c4 {The English opening.} e5 {Black grabs the center.} 2. Nc3 {White develops his knight behind the pawn and takes control of the white central squares.} Nf6 {Black contests the center and prepares for castling.} 3. d3 {Supports c4 and stops ...e4} d5 {Initiates a trade of a central pawn for a good knight outpost.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 {Excellent outpost for the knight.} 5. g3 {Prepares a fianchetto.} Nc6 {Develops the knight.} 6. Bg2 {Completed the fianchetto. And puts the knight on d5 under fire. The whole game will revolve around the h1-a8 diagonal.} Be6 {Protects the knight and develops the white bishop.} 7. e3 {White prepares d4 and temporarily locks in the dark bishop } Be7 {Bb4 is an option but stretches Blacks resources. Black has already a good hold of the center. Hence Be7 is a good move and enables castling.} 8. Nge2 {* enables castling * develops a knight * supports the d4 advance} O-O {Bring the king to safety before committing oneself to uncertain campaigns. } 9. O-O {ditto} a6 {Takes the b5 square from the c3-knight.} 10. d4 {Here we go! A little central activity.} exd4 {Forced: 11.dxe5 would have discovered a third attacker against Nd5 I would have loved 11...e4 but that looses the pawn } 11. exd4 Bf6 {Put more pressure on the d4 pawn.} 12. Be3 {Protects the pawn.} Nce7 {Ne7 supports Nd5 and enables the advancing of the queen-side pawns.  My long term target is the isolated pawn on d4 } 13. Nf4 {Attacks d5 but fails after...} Nxc3 {which gives me an excellent outpost on c4 and releases the pressure on d5. } 14. bxc3 Bc4 {Alternatives: c6 to protect my pawns and against d5 or Bc4!? grabs the outpost and avoids 15.Nxe6  } 15. Re1 {I wouldn't have played 14...Bc4 against a stronger player: 15.Bxb7 would have been complicated: 15...Rb8 16.Rb1! Bxf1 17.Kxf1} c6 {* Protects b7  * Takes control of d5 * Opens the a5-d8 diagonal for the queen} 16. Qa4 {Threatens the bishop} b5 {Natural follow up move - cements the bishop on c4. It will take the knight at least two moves to unsettle the bishop  Because of Qa4 - with tempo} 17. Qb4 {The queen is going to c5 which is a good outpost for White.} Re8 {Seizes the open file and protects the knight. I will soon need to move the dark bishop or the queen and I don't want any tactics against the knight } 18. Qc5 {Threatens c6.  The queen has a good position here with many possibilities. It is also safe against short term threats from  Black's minor pieces.} Rc8 {c6 needs another defender.   } 19. Nh5 {I think White contemplated 19.Qa7 threatening a6. But this fails after ...a5. Instead White decided to remove the dark bishop. Black's dark bishop is putting lots of pressure on the c3-d4 pawns.} Nd5 {Black don't want to take back with a pawn. Instead  19...Nd5 * protects the bishop twice  * threatens the c3 pawn.  * still protects the c6 pawn by blocking the h1-a8 diagonal.  Not bad with one move.} 20. Nxf6+ {White continues with his plan.} Qxf6 {Best is to take back with the queen. * Makes the queen more active. * Binds the rooks * Keeps the pressure on the c3-d4 pawns. * Protects the c6 pawn so the knight can move. } 21. Bxd5 {? Defends c3 by removing the attacker. But this exchanges the light bishop for a knight. This means that the Black's light bishop can seize the h1-a8 diagonal.} Bxd5 {The exchange ends with the bishop on the deadly h1-a8 diagonal shooting directly against White's king. Black dreams of Qg2 which ends the game.} 22. f4 {Takes away f3 from the queen.} Qf5 {Putting the queen on the same color as the bishop to give me maximum flexibility.  White it terribly weak on the light squares.} 23. Qa3 {The queen retreats: * defend the second rank (23...Qh3 24.Qb2)  * threatens a6.} Rxe3 {Re3!? My plan is to: * remove the dark bishop, which is a good defender: a queen invasion Qc2 is blocked by Bf2 * invade on Qc2 - threatening mate on g2. * check on g1 and gobble up the rook: Kf1 Qg1  Kd2 Qxa1} 24. Rxe3 {Black is now vulnerable on the e-file, back-rank and a6 and must keep the initiative. } Qc2 {Qf2# is imminent and cannot be blocked for long.} 25. Kf1 {Forced, the only way to avoid mate.} Qg2+ 26. Ke1 Qg1+ 27. Kd2 {All according to plan when I realized that Qxa1 looses after 28.Re1! and the queen is trapped! I should have calculated one more move before sacrificing the rook.  Actually mate can be forced in 10 moves after 22.Qa3. A sample variation is 23. Qa3 Qe4 24.Re2 Qh1  25.Kf2 Qf3  26.Ke1 Rxe3 27.Qf8  Kxf8 28.Rxe3 Qxe3  29.Kf1 Qf3  30.Ke1 Re8  31.Kd2 Re2  32.Kd1 Qf1#} Qxh2+ {Gobbling pawns is another way to compensate for the sacrifice. White gives up at this point - probably premature. The possible continuation 28.Re2 Qxg3 29. Re1 Qxf4  30.Kc2 is a very sharp and uncertain position}
