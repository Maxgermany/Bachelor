[Opening "Centre game (C21)"]

1. e4 {The king's pawn opening. My usual opening move as white. Gives my queen and light-square bishop freedom, and potentially threatens checkmate quickly.} e5 {The king's pawn game. My opponent is possibly hoping to checkmate quickly, too.} 2. d4 {The centre game. I have a high success rate with this opening sequence of moves. My dark-square bishop is free, too, and I have control of three diagonals.} Nc6 {He develops his knight to attack my queen's pawn and defend his king's pawn...} 3. dxe5 Nxe5 {...so we swap pawns...} 4. Nf3 {...and I delay bringing out my queen one move, instead attacking his knight with mine...} Nxf3+ 5. Qxf3 {...and we swap knights. My queen sits nicely on the 3rd rank, placing me ahead on development.} Nf6 {He now develops his remaining knight...} 6. Bg5 {...so I develop my dark-square bishop, attacking the knight, forcing it to act as a pin for the queen...} d6 7. Nc3 {...and I develop my remaining knight, allowing me to castle queenside...} Be7 {...and he moves out his bishop to allow his knight to move away, and to castle kingside...} 8. O-O-O {...and I castle queenside, placing my rook on the d-file, threatening e5, a pawn fork on the d6-pawn and knight...} O-O {...and he castles kingside to allow this to happen...} 9. e5 {...here. If he keeps his knight on f6, he either loses it for a pawn, or he loses his queen for a rook and pawn...} Nd7 {...so he moves it out of harm's way...} 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 {...so we trade bishops...} 11. exd6 cxd6 {...and pawns, creating an isolated pawn on d6...} 12. Qd5 {...so I line it up with my queen, covered by her rook...} Nc5 13. Qxd6 {...and remove it, giving me the slightest of advantages - a single pawn.} Qg5+ {Now he checks my king with his queen...} 14. Qd2 {...so I block with mine, looking to exchange, being ahead on material.} Qg4 {He moves his queen out of my queen's attacking line, eyeing up my kingside knight's pawn, should my bishop drop its guard...} 15. Qe3 {...so I move mine to attack his knight...} Bf5 {...but this was a gamebreaking move. Bringing out his bishop and leaving his knight en prise, no doubt hoping to threaten checkmate in two moves, when the e4 square was covered by my knight...} 16. Qxc5 {...allows me to steal his knight with my queen. I have 31 points, he has 27.} Qg5+ {He checks my king with his queen again...} 17. Qe3 {...so I block with mine again, higher up. I have more of a reason for like-for-like exchanges now: I have a more significant advantage.} Qg6 {He moves his queen away, keeping my KNP under her attack, behind her bishop, on its line...} 18. Bd3 {...so I attack his bishop with mine, allowing me to win at least one piece, with my bishop being on the same diagonal as his bishop and queen. I have also connected my rooks...} Bxd3 19. Qxd3 {...so we trade our remaining bishops, leaving our queens as the only pieces that can move diagonally. I now have 28 points, he has 24.} Qxg2 {He finally captures the pawn his queen was threatening...} 20. Qg3 {...and I attack her with my queen...} Qc6 {...forcing her to the only safe place.} 21. Rhg1 {I now place a rook behind my queen, threatening mate in one move...} g6 {...but he moves the threatened pawn to avoid this...} 22. h4 {...so I move my rook's pawn to threaten it...} h5 {...but he stops it with his rook's pawn...} 23. f4 {...so I move my bishop's pawn to threaten from the other side...} f5 {...and again he stops it with his bishop's pawn. However, his knight's pawn has lost the protection from its neighbours, with only the queen covering...} 24. Qxg6+ {...so I win back the pawn, opening up the g-file, also performing a royal fork...} Qxg6 25. Rxg6+ {...and I finally get the queen exchange I was looking for. I have 18 points, he has 14.} Kf7 26. Rdd6 {I now double my rooks on the 6th rank, boxing the king onto his bottom two...} Rfe8 {...and although his rook takes the open e-file...} 27. Rdf6+ {...I check with one of mine...} Ke7 {...forcing him onto his only safe square...} 28. Nd5+ {...so my knight can come up to help...} Kd7 29. Rg7+ {...and my rook checks again...} Kc8 {...to force him onto his starting rank, but on the same shade square as my knight...} 30. Ne7+ {...so my knight can check him again on the 7th rank...} Kb8 {...but as he keeps his king on his starting rank, with my knight covering the g8 square...} 31. Rg8 {...I can skewer his rook on that square...} Rxg8 32. Nxg8 {...so I can exchange rooks. What I intended to do next was to hoover up the pawns on f5 and h5 to make mine on f4 and h4 passed.} Kc7 {As he moves his king off his starting rank...} 33. Nh6 {...my knight must retreat. It is also threatening the f-pawn...} Re8 {..and although his remaining rook takes the open e-file...} 34. Rxf5 {...mone can hoover up his kingside bishop's pawn, making mine passed...} Re1+ {...and his rook lands on my king's starting rank...} 35. Kd2 {..forcing him off it, to his only safe square.} Ra1 {His rook threatens my queenside rook's pawn...} 36. a3 {...so I move it to its only safe place...} Ra2 {...and his rook threatens my knight's pawn...} 37. Kc3 {...so I move my king to protect it...} Ra1 38. Rxh5 {...and my rook can hoover up his kinsgide rook's pawn, making mine passed.} Rf1 {He threatens my bishop's pawn on the kingside...} 39. f5 {...so I move it up, into my rook's path.} Kd7 {He's obviously hoping to threaten my pieces with his king, although only the rook can be threatened...} 40. Kd4 {...so I move my king closer to my kingside bishop's pawn...} Ke7 {...and as his king moves closer...} 41. Ng8+ {...I check him with my knight...} Kf7 {...but he moves onto a light square, the same shade as my knight's...} 42. Nh6+ {...so it checks him again. I didn't know what to do next...} Kg7 43. Kc3 {...so I move my king back one rank. I was thinking of Ng4 then Rg5, to allow my kingside pawns to advance to the 6th rank...} Rd1 44. Ng4 {...and I move my knight to the g4 square to cover the f6 and h6 squares my pawn were hoping to move into...} Rg1 {...and although his rook movs behind my knight, no doubt hoping to surprise it...} 45. Rg5+ {...my rook protects it, checking the king...} Kf8 46. h5 {...so my rook's pawn advances to the 5th rank, into the rook's protection.} Rg3+ {His rook checks on the 3rd rank...} 47. Kb4 {...so I move my king up one, to avoid being checked on the 2nd rank.} Rg2 {His rook lines up my pawns on the 2nd rank...} 48. f6 {...but I can't understand why I move up my kingside bishop's pawn there...} Rxc2 {...when I was clearly about to lose my queenside one...} 49. h6 {...and I also can't understand why I moved up my kingside rook's pawn...} Rxb2+ {...when my queenside knight's pawn was also under attack, and that losing it would result in check.} 50. Kc3 {I move my king to attack the rook...} Rb6 {...so he moves it as back for cover from its pawn.} 51. Rg7 {With his king on his starting rank, I move my rook to the my 7th rank, hoping to advance my kingside rook's pawn to h7, and possibly to checkmate with promotion...} Rc6+ {...but as his rook checks again...} 52. Kb2 {...I move my king close to my queenside pawn, for cover...} Re6 {...but moving his rook along the rank without checking...} 53. h7 {...allowed my kingside rook's pawn to advance to the 7th rank, and cover the g8 square: should my opponent's rook threaten it from behind, Rg8+ will distract the king, and queening will cover it.} Re2+ {He checks on the 2nd rank...} 54. Kc1 {...so I drop my king onto his starting rank...} Re1+ {...and he checks again, on my bottom rank...} 55. Kd2 {...so I threaten his rook...} Rh1 {...and he moves it to threaten my pawn from behind...} 56. Rg8+ {...so I move up my rook to check his king and distract him...} Kf7 {...forcing him to his only available square...} 57. h8=Q {...allowing my pawn to the far right-hand corner to queen...} Rxh8 {...and as his rook captures her...} 58. Rxh8 {...I can capture his rook...} a5 59. Rh7+ {...and check him one more time...} Kf8 {...and as his king moves onto his starting rank, again...} 60. Rxb7 {...my rook can hoover up another pawn, with his only remaining pawn about to be blocked by mine on a3...} Ke8 61. Kc3 {...so I advance my king to close his down, to get into his position for my rook to mate...} a4 {...and his pawn advances to the square where it can move no more...} 62. Kd4 Kf8 63. Ke5 Kg8 64. Kf5 Kf8 65. Kg6 Kg8 66. Rb8# {...and I keep my king moving, up to the 6th rank, and with my opponent moving his king onto the same file, my rook could advance to the top rank for a king and rook checkmate.}
