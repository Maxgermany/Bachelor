[Opening "QGD (D06), Grau (Sahovic) defence"]

1. d4 {My favored opening. My friend rt4sm claims this is not an exciting way to start. He may very well be right, but I have played it so many times, it feels like an old flannel shirt or your favorite shotgun;comfortable and warm.....It's won me a fair amount of games too, and in my opinion seems to favor white more than e4. (keep in mind my opinions are pretty laughable most of the time)} d5 {A pretty standard response.} 2. c4 {1.d4 seems to commonly followed by 2. c4. The Queen's Gambit. Will he accept or decline?} Bf5 {Decline!  D06: QGD, Grau (Sahovic) defense. I've played this twice as white, one win, one draw. Seems like I have a chance if I don't make a blunder, but all of my previous games with yodean have gone _his_ way, so I know I have to play perfectly to have a chance.} 3. Nc3 e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 {This seems pretty standard so far, both sides are getting pieces in place for the coming battles. QGD games allow for development for both sides and don't seem to have huge attack potential for black right away. } 5. Bg5 {I normally don't use queen pins like this as they are so easily counteracted, but I thought I'd give it a whirl this game. Worst case is a pawn attack on the bishop and having to skulk back to g3. Really not a bad spot for a bishop anyhow. } Be7 {Black frees the knight from the pin and leaves potential for a discovered attack on the  bishop.} 6. e3 {protecting the c pawn and preparing for a kingside castle.} h6 {Now he's out to dislodge the bishop.} 7. Bh4 Bb4 {Now MY knight is pinned. This happens so often in Queen Pawn games I hardly give it a second thought, I'm normally happy to trade Knight for Bishop. } 8. Be2 Be4 {Still not concerned. I'd love to have both his bishops off the table!} 9. O-O Bxc3 10. bxc3 {This is fine with me. Only downside is the lone pawn on the a file. I rather like the doubled pawns in this case. } Qe7 {Hmmm. wasn't sure what to make of this move. I'd have castled, and the black diagonal he moved on seems like a dead end. Crap, he has a plan, I'm sure.} 11. cxd5 {the pawn is a dead duck, but has  another one right behind him to complicate matters.} exd5 12. Rb1 {?? I am trying to get him to move the b pawn. It seems SO smart to move here. If he advances the b pawn I can move my Bishop to b5 and cause all sorts of mischief. } Bxb1 {EXCEPT for Blacks Bishop. Crap crap crap. I was trying to be so careful. What a moron. I'm doomed and I know it, down 2 points and minus a rook to dean is certain death. I should just quit. This sucks, I loathe myself and all of chess. The squares are leering at me. I'll take the Bishop before I quit at least......} 13. Qxb1 {What the heck, I just as well play on. I've been less willing to resign lately with some success, so I decided to play on. I didn't need that stupid, bulky, hard to move rook anyhow! } b6 {Hey wait! This is what I wanted in the first place!} 14. Bb5+ {and this!} c6 {and even this!} 15. Ba4 {he's going to take all the fun out of this when he castles.} O-O {Fun hater!} 16. Qd3 {I see a potential on h7 if I can dislodge his knight.} Qe6 {Dean sees it too.} 17. Nd2 {Clearing the file for f pawn advance and attack on e4, I prefer to move the f pawn over the h pawn to protect g4} Nbd7 {Uh oh, paired rooks. And mine is in hiding.} 18. f3 Rfe8 {Black sees a potential open file.} 19. Re1 {So does white!} Qd6 {He'd rather not trade Queen for rook, I'm sure! Has to move it before the file opens up. Also points her at h2 and can cause real problems if he can get N-g4!} 20. e4 {This is what I have been working for. I have lots of firepower pointing at e4.} dxe4 21. Nxe4 Nxe4 22. fxe4 Qg6 {He is now going to load up on my pretty defenseless king.} 23. Bc2 {But I have that silly knight out of the way and I can proceed with my attack on h7} c5 {no WAY am I breaking my pawn chain. If he takes the d pawn I still own the center with my pawns, but if I take his c pawn, I am opened up like a gutted deer, no thanks!} 24. Re3 {R - g3 is on my mind.} Qg4 {dean is going to get rid of that pesky bishop and prevent R-g3. Good move.} 25. e5 {But might have been the kicker. Now he HAS to protect h7. Makes me very glad I did not take his c pawn. My king feels pretty secure, but this is still dicey! } Qg6 {About the only logical thing. I think moving the g pawn would have been worse.} 26. Qe2 {"Scoot, Ms. Queen!"  I see some potential here.} Qe6 27. Rg3 {I could have taken the attack right to the queen with B-b3, but I decided I should seal off the g file first. } g6 {He knows what I'm thinking........} 28. Bb3 {Now where is that queen going? } Qf5 {It's getting uncomfortable for Black's Queen now, mostly responding to my attacks than mounting one of her own.} 29. Rf3 {Again! ...  more limited choices for black, and I am liking the Bishop/rook pointing at f7. Looks like I might win that rook back after all!} Qh5 {Dean resigns at this point. I am amazed. I think he was being kind. I did feel good about my play though, I kept up the pressure and did not allow him to gain momentum ...  Had he been able to involve his rooks, I would have been sunk, but applying pressure to the queen and the h7 square kept my foe off balance. Thanks for a great game Dean!}
