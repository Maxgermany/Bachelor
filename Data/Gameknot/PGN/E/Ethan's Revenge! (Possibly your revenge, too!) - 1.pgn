[Opening "QGD (D06), symmetrical (Austrian) defence"]

1. d4 {My standard as white, Queens Pawn. } d5 2. c4 c5 {QGD, symmetrical (Austrian) defense   I have only played against this opening once, looks like it should be a very open fast paced game.} 3. cxd5 {I opt for immediate exchange.} Qxd5 {Black obliges.} 4. Nf3 cxd4 5. Nc3 {I have 2 knights developed and the black pawn at d4 is a dead duck. Not to mention his Queen being under attack. So far so good, and pretty standard judging from the GK database.} Qa5 6. Nxd4 {Material equality.} e5 {I have to move the Knight twice, which I normally loathe, but I'm okay with that for now. He still has only his Queen developed and my reply will attack her.} 7. Nb3 Qb6 {I think Black is looking at f2, but with no support that will be a tough one. I don't like having both my knights placed so far from his (and my) King, but this looks playable!} 8. e4 {Stopping the pawn and opening up the WS Bishop.} Bb4 {Very common pin in the QP game. I never worry about them. I'm typically happy to have a bishop over a knight.} 9. Bd2 {I still allow the possibility of the knight moving (like to d6!) and get another piece into the fray. But Black has much potential and I have to be careful!} Be6 {More pressure on the knights. I want my WS Bishop out of there and my King safely ensconced in the corner!} 10. Be2 Nc6 {pretty even in development and his queen could present a problem.} 11. O-O {Mow I can focus on the Queen side attacks, and try some of my own.} Rd8 {I expected nf6 to prepare to castle. Unless I act, I lose the knight!} 12. Qc2 Bxb3 13. Qxb3 {I decide to leave my pawns intact. I wonder though if the open file on A would have helped. Oh well, the die is cast!} Rxd2 {Rats! This seems to be my trademark. Squandering a minor piece early on. And one of my beloved bishops at that!At least I still have the other one!} 14. Bc4 {I am attacking f7 as well as getting the WS Bishop the heck out of there!} Qc7 {Q-c7 was the most common reply in move 7, now I see why....} 15. Nd5 {Wheee! Fork!!} Qd7 16. Nxb4 {I grab the Bishop like a bum grabs a bottle of MD 20/20. Material equality! I'm not convinced the rook/queen pair on the d file isn't going to be a problem.} Nd4 17. Qc3 {I'm gonna get that rook!} Nf6 {Or not. I really had it figured that the Rook was doomed. This was a good move in my opinion, I am forced to protect the e pawn.  I also see that if Qxd2 then N-f3  and my queen is cooked. } 18. Rae1 {I probably opted for the wrong rook, I never have figured that out. One quote I read said something to the effect that you should consider which rook to move for a long time,...then move the other one! } O-O {Black looks stronger now, esp with the rook on the 7th rank!} 19. Nd5 {He has to trade knights (or move it away) or risk wrecking his king side pawn structure.} Nxd5 20. exd5 {still materially equal, but black looks more able to attack.} Rc2 {And he does!} 21. Qd3 {I have had my eye on the e5 pawn, now he has to protect it. And I have effectively broken the Queen/rook pair he had.} Rxb2 {He opts to trade.} 22. Rxe5 {Fine with me.} Nc2 {He had to move it, but I don't think this was the best spot.} 23. a3 {The Knight has no way out now.} Qa4 {I pondered the board for some time here, and saw an opportunity. I'll stop the jabbering until the end now, and just let you play it out. } 24. d6 Qxa3 25. Bxf7+ Rxf7 26. Re8+ Rf8 27. Qd5+ Kh8 28. Rxf8# {And there it was. Right out of the Bobby Fisher Teaches Chess book! ( I think anyhow, I gave my copy to a buddy.)  Back rank attack, deflecting the king with the queen check, all started by a pretty innocuous pawn move and a bishop sacrifice. Sweet!  Thanks for the great games remybear, I hope we play hundreds more!}
