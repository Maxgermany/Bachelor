1. c4 {Another game from my fishy tournament. A draw would put me joint third and a win joint second with only one game left for me to play.  Despite making some poor moves and losing material, I made a bit of a fighting come back near the end, probably the best come back I have ever made, helped by a few mistakes from white.} b5 {Starting position - the halibut/Jaenisch gambit} 2. cxb5 Nf6 {Staking a claim on the centre and discouraging e4} 3. Nc3 e5 4. Nf3 {This move takes us out of the gameknot database where the only listed options are d4 and e4} Bb7 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 d5 7. Bg5 Nbd7 {Looking back I have severe doubts about this move, perhaps Be2 was better} 8. Rd1 Bc5 9. Qf4 h6 10. Bxf6 {Gives me the bishop pair but I need to work out how to take advantage of it} Nxf6 11. e3 Qd6 12. Be2 O-O 13. Qxd6 Bxd6 14. O-O Rfe8 15. Nh4 Rad8 16. Nf5 Bc5 17. Na4 {Surely not the best move from white, the knight here looks rather out of place to me} Bf8 18. Bf3 Ne4 19. Rd4 c5 20. Rd3 Kh8 21. Rfd1 c4 22. Rd3d4 g6 {Trying to push the other knight to the side} 23. Bxe4 gxf5 {I can't recall why I did this, looking now dxe4 looks better, particularly as this loses me a pawn} 24. Bxd5 Bg7 25. Rd4d2 Bxd5 26. Rd2xd5 Rdc8 27. Rd5d7 Bxb2 {sacrifice with the hope of promoting the c pawn but I miscalculated as we will see} 28. Nxb2 c3 29. Nd3 c2 30. Rc1 Red8 31. Ne5 Rxd7 32. Nxd7 Rd8 33. Rxc2 Rxd7 {threatens Rd1#} 34. g3 Rb7 35. a4 a6 36. bxa6 Ra7 37. Rc6 Kg7 38. Kg2 f6 {This was to shield from the rook} 39. Kf3 Kg6 40. Kf4 Rd7 41. h4 Rd2 {threatens Rf2#} 42. f3 {Whites king is starting to look a little uncomfortable} Rb2 {Looking at Rb4 regaining a pawn} 43. a7 Rb4+ {White obliges} 44. e4 Rxa4 45. Rc7 fxe4 46. fxe4 h5 {Looking to keep whites king away as much as possible} 47. Ke3 Kh6 48. Kf4 Kg6 49. Rd7 {By now this game was looking drawish to me as  am not going to allow white to promote on a and I am hoping I have enough to hold back the rest of his pawns} Kh6 {This may look like a mistake but I had a plan here} 50. Kf5 {Again white obliges but this loses a pawn} Rxa7 {I was very pleased with this move. My rook is immune as RxR gives stalemate} 51. Rd6 Ra3 {This is a poor move, Kg7 is probably better} 52. Rxf6+ Kg7 53. Rg6+ Kf7 54. g4 Ra5+ 55. e5 hxg4 56. Rxg4 Ra6 57. h5 Rh6 58. Rg5 {Whites optons are limited, would Rh4 be any better?} Ke7 59. Kg4 Kf7 {Avoiding e6 due to Rg6+ which would lose} 60. Rf5+ Ke6 61. Kg5 {This is another mistake from white} Rxh5+ 62. Kxh5 {Game drawn and I moved up a place in the tournament.   Please rate and comment}
