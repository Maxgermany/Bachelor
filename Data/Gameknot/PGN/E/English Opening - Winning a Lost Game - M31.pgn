1. c4 {Trying another English against the computer, this time at a higher level, FH003. } c5 {I was hoping for this response, to try some ideas. } 2. b4 {?! A gambit because I felt like trying it out. I have no idea if this is a known gambit. } cxb4 {Accepted. } 3. Bb2 {A modern approach to the center. } d5 {This is a good response, it immediately challenges control of d5. } 4. e3 {Playing to activate and mobilize pieces, and saving c4. } Nf6 {Controls e4 and g4, important squares, double protects d5. If (5.Bxf6 exf6) then black can activate a bishop. Prepares 0-0. } 5. Nf3 {Controls d4 and e5, prepares 0-0. } Bg4 {A strong pin is applied. } 6. h3 {Forcing a decision for the bishop. } Bf5 {Good placement, nice control of d3 and e4, contributes to central control. } 7. Nd4 {Forcing more positional choices for the bishop. This may not have been the best move, but maybe not quite dubious as it fights for central control. } Bd7 {?! Releases central control, Bg6 is better. } 8. Bd3 {?! Adding to control of central squares. The bishop is hanging and a little akward here, but it is fighting for central control. My mental ply was set a little low though because black can lock up the bishop with a good set of attacking pawn moves, as will be seen in the game continuation, which had I been more focused I would have noticed and may have played differently. } e5 {A good move, threatens to take the center, gains tempo. } 9. Ne2 {The best choice, 9.Nf3 ?? loses to a pawn fork. } e4 {! Wins a pawn and gains positionally. } 10. Bc2 {Now white has a shutdown of 4 essential pieces. Plans for freedom are considered, and for castling as well. } dxc4 {-/+ An interesting position where the pawns threaten some, but more so they keep key pieces trapped in the corner. } 11. O-O {This almost seems like it should have been delayed so that the pawns at b4, c4, e4 can be attacked, but with the text move is the enabling of the move f3 which contributes to the freeing of pieces over a little time. } Bc5 {Good development of the bishop, controls center, allows 0-0. } 12. Ng3 {Double attack on e4. } Qe7 {Counterplay. -/->e4 } 13. f3 {Breaking open a line. } c3 {?  -/= Black decides to mix it up and makes a lunge at the bishop, while an attacking move, it does give up the constrictive control that the pawns afforded in their previous position. Now white can free pieces from the corner. } 14. dxc3 Bxe3+ {Forcing, gains tempo with material, but the bishop has no more gains afterwards. } 15. Kh1 exf3 {Offering some threat by fxg2+ if ignored, so it forces a response. } 16. Rxf3 {Enacting a simple plan of attacking the bishop, but the timing does not really allow this to work and it seems positionally akward. Mabe Qxf3 would have been better since it attacks b7 and prepares Re1. } Na6 {Besides covering b4 it allows the knight to be developed in the event of cxb4. } 17. Bf5 {?! Trying to swindle by (17...Bxf5 18.Nxf5) forking attack on queen, bishop and g7. } O-O-O {! Refutes my simple attack well and gives me something to think about now that the queen can become rook fodder. } 18. Bd3 {Regrouping. } Rhe8 {Nice centralization of the rooks. } 19. Bxa6 {!? Breaking down the walls, makes this move worthy because it doubles pawns as well, creating a bit of luft around the king. } bxa6 20. cxb4 {! Prevents pawn chains, opens a nice line to the king, frees the bishop. } Qxb4 {Besides recapture, attacks the bishop. } 21. Bc3 {Saves the bishop while working to gain positionally. } Qb6 {Maintains some positional control, especially by overprotecting the bishop. } 22. Na3 {?! A risky move made entirely with the idea of freeing the rook, a piece of obvious importance now that there is a nice open file to the king. The possibility of this being a sacrifice was considered when choosing this move. } Bxh3 {! Taking advantage of the tactic while it is still available. } 23. Qe2 {It seems an akward placement of the queen, but it keeps an eye on g2 while not making an obvious try at Qc2 with a simple revealed attack on the king because that is too easily seen and can be refuted. Instead I planned to bring the rook inline with the king while maintaing a safe placement of the queen. } Bc5 {A revealed attack on the queen, almost seems like white is beaten into the corner with this move, but there is a small positional factor to consider. } 24. Qc4 {!? Pins the bishop while relieving the queen from the rook attack. } Be6 {But now it seems that while does not even have this refuge. } 25. Qf4 {A seemingly pointless move, but it takes away an escape route from the king in the event of an attack while placing the queen in a place of relative safety. There are still some moves to consider before an attack will succeed, but I was optimistic at this point. Yes, this move sacrifices the knight. } Bg4 {Black tries to take away every positive positional plus from white, but surprisingly this move actually benefits white by moving the rook to a better position. } 26. Rff1 {Tied rooks are stronger, and the back rank affords the rooks some safety for manuevers. } Bxa3 {And now black finally makes a nice material gain. } 27. Qa4 {!? A risky move with the idea of contributing to an attack on the king while threatening to win back material. Its not easy to visualize the concepts that are forming in the position, but they will become clearer over the next few moves. } Re3 {The text move is based on the assumption of (28.Qxa3 Rxg3) and then taking advantage of the pin to the c3 bishop to try and take the piece. } 28. Ba5 {! Striking back with a strong move that is not made with the idea of simply winning the exchange, but instead with the idea of gaining positionally by clearance for the rook and siezing an important line by the bishop, taking control of key squares. } Qd4 {?? A positional blunder which gives the game to white. Better was ...Qd6 to try for counterplay. The text move loses control of c6, a critical square. I considered an alternative variation, but it does not stop the inevitable. (28... Qd6 29. Bxd8 Qxd8 30. Rfd1 Qb6 31. Qc4+ Kb8 32. Rab1 Qxb1 33. Rxb1+ Ka8 34. Qc6#) } 29. Qc6+ {The game is now irrefutably won. } Kb8 30. Bc7+ Kc8 31. Bd6# {I am actually surprised to have won this game, it actually seemed to be failing miserably back at move 9...e4 where the black pawns were constricting the position badly. I made the decision to play on just to try some tactical/positional exercises. Most the of the game seemed to be me fighting my way back out of the hole I played myself into. Just goes to show you, never give up. }
