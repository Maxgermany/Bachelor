1. c4 {English I did not play this game on GameKnot.com.  I played this person to person.} e5 2. Nc3 g6 {This is a very slow move. It can give white the initiative d4! or Nf3!? I believe in the future, I'll play g6; Bg7; e5 or e5; Nc6; g6 Knowing my opponent, I think he wouldn't even play the attacking move mention.} 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 Nc6 {Both of us are now controlling each others (4th & 5th rank) d-pawn square } 5. d3 {I am not sure if he played this move or e4 right away, but I know what it transposed to} d6 6. e4 {My foe decieded to play the Nimzo-Botvinik system,  I learned of this system while my days playing at a chess club in seattle.  I've seen a couple of games  with white winning by using this system and heard it is a universal system for white.  I also seen a couple of games with black winning.  The setup I use, I'm black, is what Gregory Serper used to beat a young kid Michael Lee in Wa state Championship.  However, I did not play Nh5 and Instead playing Nd7 incorrectly playing the system.  Kasparov also played this line as black a couple of times} f5 {Now I am setting up a King's Indian formation without having to move my knight twice to play f5.} 7. Nge2 Nf6 8. O-O O-O 9. a3 {?! A little meek.} a5 10. Rb1 Be6 11. Bg5 Qd7 12. Nd5 Rf7 {This can lead to a wasted tempo via B/Nxf6; Bxf6 and B/Nxf6 and then I have to move my rook again.  This is where my knowledge of the Serper game left me.  Here he played Nh5 for what reason, I do not know.} 13. b4 axb4 14. axb4 Ne7 {  ?  Now I made a mistake.  I did not want to move the rook and surrender the a-file to White's Rook.  So, I wanted to attack the Nd5; c6, but this allows white to win the b-Pawn} 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7 16. exf5 {  !} gxf5 17. Bxb7 {This is when I said, "darn it, I knew I should have played Raf8"} Raf8 18. f4 {!?} Qd7 {Trying to trap his bishop, in vain.} 19. b5 e4 20. Nd4 {  ?!  He gives me a extra move.} exd3 {  !} 21. Bc6 {  !} Qc8 {I did not want to pin my queen against his dark squared bishop on e7, restricting the mobility of my knight.  In the future, I knew he was going to be useful on e4.} 22. Ra1 {  !  I foresaw the doom of my Queen } Bxc4 {  !  I decided to go into the endgame} 23. Ra8 Qxa8 {  !} 24. Bxa8 Rxa8 25. Re1 Ne4 {  !} 26. Nxf5 Rxf5 27. Rxe4 Ra1 28. Qxa1 Bxa1 29. Rxc4 Rxb5 {  ??   Missing the chance to queen my pawn.  I played this on a real chess board  and did not calculate  deep enough.} 30. Kf2 {Now I can't queen my pawn} Rd5 31. Ke1 d2+ 32. Kd1 c5 33. Rc2 h5 34. Rxd2 Rxd2+ 35. Kxd2 Kf7 36. h3 Ke6 37. g4 hxg4 38. hxg4 Bg7 39. Ke2 Kd5 40. f5 Ke5 41. Ke3 d5 42. Bh4 Bf6 {  ??} 43. Bg3# {}
