1. d4 {For this game annotation, I am assuming viewers understand basic openings and the reason those "book" moves are played. If you have any questions about any opening or certain moves in an opening... feel free to message me.} d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {4.Nf3 is sometimes played so as to delay the commitment of the QB . However, the moves (4.Nf3 & 4.Bg5) are usually both played one way or another. The battle is revolving around the d5 pawn and with that... the control of e4.} Nc6 {This move caught me off gaurd. A little reminescent of Chigorins Defense but, it is a little late for that. Still, I see no way to win the d5 pawn since an immediate 5.Bxf6 Qxf6 leaves me having to defend my d4 pawn instead of winning the d5 pawn.} 5. Nf3 h6 {This move only helps White decide what to do. Doubling Blacks pawns on f6 (6.Bxf6) was a threat since recapturing with the Q loses the d5 pawn i.e. 6.Bxf6 Qxf6  7.cxd exd  8.Nxd5! but, it is too early to know if the Bg5 will be missed. After 5 ...h6, White doesn't have much choice.} 6. Bxf6 gxf6 {As previously noted... 6 ...Qxf6 loses a pawn on d5} 7. e3 {I decided at this point, because Black has the 2Bishops, I would like to close it up as much as possible and limit his 2B as much as possible especially with that open g file his Rooks conviently have against my eventual O-O. Playing in the Center with 7.e4 or 7.dxc will leave me with better control of the Center but, it will just open up the position for his 2B which I feel, I did not want to allow. My plan at this point is to close up with ...c5 and follow up with an eventual b2-b4-b5 & a2-a4.} Bd6 8. c5 Be7 9. Be2 f5 {I think Black might be beginning to feel the predictament his 2B are in but, with that in mind... maybe 9 ...e5 would be better. It's hard to prove but, I just wouldnt feel comfortable giving up e5 & g5 to Whites Knights. I suppose Black can shore up the defense of e5 by playing his doubled f pawn to f6 but then his dark Bishop is locked in again AND his light Bishop now has TWO pawns blocking him instead of just one.} 10. O-O {It is important to play this position slowly. Black made the mistake of losing control of e5 with 9 ...f5 but, this is a strategic game, nobody is going anywhere. The e5 square isnt going anywhere. I did not want to put my Knight on e5, start some attack on the Queenside only to have to pause to castle because Black played a well-timed ...Rg8!! attacking my undefended g pawn. Castling first does allow Black to cover up the e5 square with 10 ...f6 but, my previous note explains why that would just make things worse for his 2B.} h5 {I think Black is best to try opening up the position. Even at the cost of a pawn with 10 ...e5?! 11.Nxe5 (11.dxe Bxc5 12.Nxd5 Be6 13.Nc3 Bd6 and despite being a pawn dow, I feel the the 2B and the open g file give Black the better game) 11 ...Nxe5  12.dxe c6! followed up with 13 ...f6 opens up the position for Blacks Bishops.} 11. Ne5 {This is the problem with 9 ...f5 since Black cannot capture with 11 ...Nxe5 allowing a further cramping of his position with 12.dxe Bxc5  13.Qd2 f6  14.f4 followed by Nb5-d5!} Rg8 {I did not capture the h5 pawn because I was still convinced that I would focus on the Queenside and Black would have no counterplay elsewhere on the board. I was afraid that giving Black another open file on the kingside would help him find counterplay on that side of the board later when I have all my pieces committed on the Queenside. To me, that was not worth the pawn. I would rather just slowly squeeze the position rather than win a pawn and possibly allow some counterplay.} 12. Nxc6 {If my Knight was not on e5. I would rather gain momentum on the QS with the traditional order of moves i.e.12.Rb1 a5  13.b3! followed by 14.a3 then 15.b4! & b5! (IF 13.a3? THEN 13 ...a4! & White would never accomplish the b4 push). However, with my Ne5, obtaining b2-b4-b5 loses importance since Blacks Nc6 has somewhere to go (...Nxe5) so, I decided to create a new target on the Queenside...} bxc6 {The c6 pawn will be my new target and, unlike the last target (Nc6)... this target is immobile making it an easier target.} 13. Qa4 {Attacking c6 with b2-b4-b5 is no longer optimal since not only can Black attack the b pawn directly down the b file but, once I obtain b5 (If I ever do), Blacks c6 pawn can simply bite back with cxb!! something the previous target (Nc6) could not do. With this in mind, it is best to attack c6 with long range pieces and manuevering a Knight to a5.} Bd7 {I was thinking 13 ...Qd7 so that I could try & find some activity with ...a5 & ...Ba6.} 14. Bxh5 {There is a reason why I made this move but, to state it here would be irrelevant so, I will only explain it to bluber53 or anyone else who just wants to know just so they can know.} Rb8 15. b4 Rg5 16. Be2 {This is where I feel the Bishop needs to be in order to help over on the Queenside although I am hesitant on removing it completly away from the Kingside squares which I am worried may soon come under some pressure due to the open g & h files. All Black may need to do is ...Bf6 & ...Ke7 in order to clear the way so that the Q and other Rook can swing over to those open files.} Rb7 {Black is a pawn down and has 2 Dead Bishops. I think it is time to get aggressive and play the strategy I mentioned in my last note. My attack on the Queenside is quicker than Blacks Kingside attack but, Black is attacking my King which makes his attack a bit more dangerous.} 17. Ba6 Rb6 {This move surprised me. I'm not sure if Black had a plan or if this is just a mistake?} 18. cxb6 cxb6 {I was beginning to believe that Black might have a plan for the sacrificed Rook after all, although if its worth a whole Rook..... ?} 19. Qc2 {Herein lies my dilema. After 18 ...cxb my gut tells me I have to get my Bishop off of a6 before it is entombed with 19 ...b5 so, I was going to play 19.Be2. Then I noticed by leaving my Queen on a4 (after 19.Be2) Black can get a protected passed pawn with 19 ...c5!  20.Qc2 c4! & Black has managed to not only neutralize the Queenside BUT... has an endgame trump card with the protected passed pawn on c4. If that isnt enough... now he can proceed with his Kingside play without any worries. Is that scenario worth a whole Rook? I dont know and I dont want to find out so, I decided to leave the Ba6 to their fate.} Qc7 {Yes, this is a good idea since this facilitates attacks against my Kingside but, i think Black should immobilize my Ba6 first with 19 ...b5. It became very clear to me that Blacks Rook sacrifice totally snubbed my Queenside play leaving him with his Kingside attack. The only thing I have is my material advantage and my passed h pawn. This is where I changed my plans in order to accomadate those two advantages.} 20. Be2 {Because I felt i had nothing more over on the Queenside & because I feel this Bishop was doing nothing on a6, I wanted to reposition it over towards the Kingside. My general plan was to use it to help advance my passed h pawn.} Bd6 {I must admit, I really thought Black would take the b pawn if, for no other reason but to close the material gap. This is a good position to demonstrate the importance of Pawns & how they can effect Bishops. Imagine if Black's e6 pawn was on e4 & Black's f5 pawn was on f4! Black's Bishops and their threats against my King would compensate for the material loss.} 21. f4 {The reason for this move was not to protect h2 (21.h4 could have done that & also further my plan) but, rather to continue to keep Black's 2Bishops under lock and key. Once things started to roll on the Kingside, I did not want Black's Q B to have such easy access to my King's position. Coincidently... I seem to remember regretting the weakness I cause to g3.} Rg6 22. h4 {More salt on my wounds. As strategically savvy as I like to THINK I am... I was not suspecting the g3 weakness would cause me minor problems. Hey! Just because I'm annotating a game doesn't mean I can play well.} Bxf4 {While I dont think this is a correct sacrifice, it does cause me some distress in a couple moves. In light of my plan (promote the hpawn), I think Black should be re-deploying this Bishop to f6 OR... to h4 to keep my pieces off of e1-f2-g3. Another plan might be ...Ke7 with the idea Qc7-d8-g8(or h8) with the follow up being ...f6 & ...Bd7-e8-h5.} 23. exf4 Rg3 {& here is the thorn in my side that Black's 22 ...Bxf4 causes me: My plan is to promote the h pawn. However, Mr. hpawn wont survive much further than h5 without a Rook backing him up. I had a simple plan to play my King to f2 and allow my Rooks to swing over but, if I did that now... 24.Kf2? THEN 24 ...Qxf4 followed by ...Qxh4. Nor can I play 24.Rf3 since after 24 ...Rxf3  25.Bxf3 Black's Q still infiltrates with 25 ...Qxf4 How about the weakness of g3? How does that play a part? Imagine if I had a pawn on h2 then, obviously Black would not be able to play 23 ...Rg3 here. Why does 23 ...Rg3 bother me? Well, one way I wanted to get the Rooks over to the h file without allowing Black's Queen to capture on f4 is (only showing White's moves) 24.Rf3, 25.Raf1, 26.h4 (remember, we put the h pawn back on h2), & 27.Rh3 Problem solved. However, since Black is able to cover the f3 square BEFORE I play my Rook there, I can no longer use that plan. *NOTE: All my Stress I was having here on this position is really unneccesary since I am actually winning the game on material. Any exchanges actually help me so, in reality... 24.Rf3 is a good move but, my inability to veer away from my plan made it impossible to find that move. Be sure to always keep a flexible thought process & do not be afraid to change, modify or delete your plans and ideas.} 24. Kh2 {My "NEW" plan is to chase the offending Rook off my property (24.Kh2), protect the f4 pawn (25.g3) & move off the h file (26.Kg2) so my Rook can play to h1 to make room for the other Rook. But, I sure did hesitate putting my King in line with Black's Queen. No matter hom many pieces stand in the way... always be a little wary when your King is in a direct path of an enemy piece.} Rg6 25. g3 e5 {? This seriously weakens d5 thanks to the undefended Queen on c7. However, if i played an immediate 26.Nxd5 then what to do after 26 ...Qd6 Hmmm? Therefore, I chose to capture on e5 first so that to limit Black's Queen moves. Two lessons: 1) Undefended pieces are usually a good signpost indicating that a tactic is present!!! The real trick is finding it. 2) It does no good just to go around blindly attacking pieces. This is Chess not Checkers, these pieces are mobile!! One would do better by making the enemy pieces as immobile as possible before attacking them.} 26. dxe5 {26.fxe is suicide for g3 i.e. 26 ...f6! and, I would not be able to keep b8-h2 diagonal closed A) 27.e6? Qxg3 28.Kh1 Qg2# B) 27.exf? Qxg3 28.Kh1 Qg2# C) 27.Bd3 fxe 28.dxe Qxe5 & g3 becomes a burden... again.} f6 27. Nxd5 {The c6 pawn cannot capture my Knight since this would allow 28.Qxc7!} cxd5 {I am not certain if Black did not see this or if, he simply gave up?} 28. Qxc7 {And what is it the REAL GM annotators Love to say here?? Oh yeah... and the rest is just cleaning up so, no further annotation is neccesary. IF ANYONE HAS ANY SUGGESTIONS ON MY ANNOTATIONS, PLEASE MESSAGE ME. I WISH TO IMPROVE ON MY GAME ANNOTATIONS SO AS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FOLLOW. I WELCOME BOTH GOOD AND BAD CRITICISM, NO MATTER HOW GOOD OR BAD.  Thank you, Michael} Ke7 29. Qd6+ Kf7 30.
