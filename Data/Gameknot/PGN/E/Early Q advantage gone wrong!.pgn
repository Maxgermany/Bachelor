1. d4 {Interesting game for couple of reasons: 1) An early Q advantage that disappeared shortly thereafter 2) Maneuvering at the end that almost escaped me... You'll see why.} d5 2. Bg5 f6 3. Bh4 Nh6 {I haven't played this opening before. I am sure I followed some kind of weird DB moves, trying to explore some kind of unusual and interesting game. Well, it got interesting much faster than I anticipated. I don't like Knight on h and a line anyways. What was I thinking?} 4. e3 g5 {Here I decide to throw King side castling away. I see a Q attack on h5, but I also see a possibility to trap that same Q. He was 1600 level player, there was a good chance he will see it and get out of it, but I take a risk again and I go for it. We played pretty fast that night and the next few moves if taken quickly might cost him greatly.} 5. Bg3 {He doesn't take the bate right then.} Bg7 {I still pretend like I don't see the Qh5 attack.} 6. Qh5+ {He goes for it. The next move was pretty crucial for the faith of the game. I am hoping he makes the wrong one.} Kf8 {The option to move the king and give up the castling allowed for a possibility of the Q trap. As for the castling at this point I really didn't care to try to preserve it. I have already given up on the King-side, by the time I clear the Queen side, it will be too late. His Q is already in my face. At this point I chose to risk it and leave Nh6 where it is, and try to go for the Q trap.} 7. Bd3 {He didn't see it! The end! } Bg4 {Bam! Over, right?} 8. Qxg4 Nxg4 {He didn't resign? Fine, I can do it slow and painful.} 9. h3 Nh6 {Retreat.} 10. Nc3 {Developing. He is down in material significantly. In reality his only option is to make the game more about the position than material advantage.  I, on the other hand although ahead in material, am completely jammed up and underdeveloped, spending so many moves on setting up the trap. Who would have thought at that point that that would matter considering my significant material advantage.} e5 {Trying to open up. Perhaps a Nc6, Nd7 would have been better. Don't know, didn't care at that time.} 11. dxe5 fxe5 12. f3 d4 {I thought that f3 was a weak move and I can afford another pawn move. Wanted to make his Nc3 uncomfortable, advance the pawns, and/or open up his e-line, before he attempts to castle.} 13. exd4 exd4 {e-line opened, Nc3 forced to move. I gain tempo, advance the pawn and open up the e-line. Very effective I thought.} 14. Ne4 {I have no pawns to attack Ne4 after the pin with Q on e-file. So his Ne4 was effective in protecting the King long enough for the castling.} Nf5 {Finally I am starting to reposition some of my stronger pieces and hopefully making them effective. Not sure that this was the best move either, however, there was still no sign of any danger.} 15. Bf2 {He is still not castling. I have no problems with that.} c5 {Looking back now I see the problem. Too many darn pawn moves! But then again, does this white position still look dangerous? I thought that too.} 16. Ne2 {He continues to develop.} Nd7 {About time.} 17. O-O {My Bg7 is attacking the wrong side, my Q not utilized, Rh8 is trapped by the King. My Nf5 is the strongest piece currently, but even this Knight is not supported and could be chased away easily if needed. All in all ugly board for the Black.} h5 {I like attacking the castled side. Is there a better time to take a risk by removing the pawns in front of your King and attack with it than with  6 material advantage? It was also a way to liberate the Rh8 rook.} 18. Nxc5 {Nice sacrifice, but discovered attack on Nf5. I did not see this move. Nice.} Nxc5 19. Bxf5 {So I lost a bit of my material advantage. Not a big deal, right?} Qd5 {I am starting to close in on his King, attacking Bf5. Plus opening 8th row for the Ra8 to get into action (if needed - I figured I really wouldn't need it).} 20. Be4 Qc4 {Attacking Ne2, and putting pressure on c2 (Be4 can be exchanged with Nc5). Note that it would not be wise to exchange N with Be4, because if NxBe4, then fxNe4, and opens up the f-file (Bf2 moved discovers R check !!!) So I decided to move the Q instead.} 21. Ng3 Re8 {I get my R involved.} 22. b3 Qa6 {I did not want to expose the Q to the constant pestering by the Bishops and the Knight by moving it to the King side of the board. So I decided to put it in the least productive part of the board! Go figure.} 23. a4 Kg8 {I really wanted to exchange as early and as often as possible, and having K on f-file prevents me from exchanging Nc5 with Be4.} 24. Bd5+ Kf8 {He takes advantage of it, and forces me lose tempo by retreating back to the original place. I really wanted to keep the h pawn supported by Rh8, hence no Kh7. Kh7 is exposed to the same diagonal attack by the white Bishop, anyway.} 25. Nf5 {He is closing in on my King?} Re5 {Dual attack on Bd5 and Nf5. Plus I am thinking it would be good to get the Rook engaged here.} 26. Bc4 {Pestering my Q again. Note that my d4 pawn is gone. Attacked by both Knight and the Bishop. More dangerously Bishop!} Qg6 {Get both  Q and the R behind the pawn surge on his King. } 27. Nxg7 {Very clever! I cannot avoid taking the Ng7, but note the a1-h8 diagonal is ruled by his Bf2 (Bxd4!). } Kxg7 {I decided to move the King off of the f-file.} 28. Bxd4 {It figures. My advantage is melting down. He has developed a very dangerous attack, and my material advantage plays no role any more.} Qd6 29. Rad1 {Very dangerous move! BxRe5  discovers attack on my Q. This is exactly why I wanted Q out of that side of the board few moves back. } Kg6 30. Bxe5 Qxe5 {My material advantage now is minimal. I am still thinking, Q vs his no Q is a stronger position any time you can have it. I usually take that scenario with up to  2 material advantage of my opponent (Q vs 2 rooks and  2 material advantage for the opponent). I found out that a free Q roaming on the open board is a much stronger than 2 rooks and up to  2 material advantage. Off course this is just a rule of thumb, but as this match shows all that can be useless if you are in significantly disadvantageous position. } 31. Rd5 Qe3+ 32. Kh1 g4 {I am finally getting the chance to start really closing in on his King.} 33. Rd6+ {Or am I?} Kg7 34. fxg4 {Opens up an f-file for his rook! f7 square supported also by Bc4. My King is in trouble! If I don't protect the f-file, I am done (Say 34. fxg4	hxg4  35.	Rf7 	Kg8 36.Rd8  Qe8 37. Rxe8#)	} Rf8 35. Rxf8 Kxf8 36. Rf6+ {He is not letting me even exchange hxg4 in peace! } Kg7 37. Rf7+ Kg6 38. gxh5+ Kxh5 39. Rf5+ Kg6 40. Rf1 Ne4 {Threatening with Nf2.} 41. Bd3 {But that is useless now.} Kg5 42. Bxe4 Qxe4 43. c4 a6 44. Rf3 {I was so happy to gain all that early advantage I could not believe I found myself in this position. He has offered a draw at this point. His Rf3 is protected with g2. This rook protects b-pawn, which protects the a and c pawn. I can't get my King anywhere close to his King to checkmate him. This is a draw! Wow. This realization hit me as a ton of bricks. However, I was so upset with myself for allowing to get to this position that I really committed to analyzing every possible combination available.  I was going through hundreds of combinations, which I won't bother you with here. However, each time I found an opening, I would also discover a well thought out counter play. However, because there was a chance of a slip up I decided to continue attacking. Frustrated I declined the draw offer, and plowed ahead in hope of a miracle...} Qb1+ {First I try to trap his Rook in some kind of King Queen combo.} 45. Kh2 Qe1 {With this move I limit his moves to pawns and Rook only.} 46. Rg3+ {I was considering 46. ...Kh4, but 47. Rg4  would just push me back. Perhaps I can attack him with Qe5, pinning his rook?} Kf5 47. Rf3+ {Nope, that's not gonna work. He really has no choice but to play there. Any other pawn move and his Rook is pinned and done.} Ke4 {Here I see an opening around his abc pawns! I am starting to develop the hope that this is a winnable match after all.} 48. Rg3 {I would love to be able to pin his rook now with Qe5, but my King is blocking the attack!} Kd4 49. Rf3 b6 {Changing the turn of the play forcing him to play Rg3 and then pinning him with Qe5.} 50. Rf4+ {He is not cooperating again. It figures.} Kc5 51. Rf3 Kb4 52. Rd3 {He is carefully avoiding the Qe5 pin and avoiding Rf4, Rg3.} Ka3 53. Rf3 Kb2 {I have gotten through his unpenetrable protection and I am inside his a-h x 1-3 rectangular castle. Can I get close enough to his King? That Rf3 has a protective wall around his King. Wall inside a wall! But I can't be stopped now.} 54. Rd3 {Again, staying away from Rg3 or Rf4. This pin would either result in loss of the rook or having to move g2. Either one a losing proposition. } Kc2 {I am closing in on the safe squares for his Rook.} 55. Rf3 {Here also note that my K is attacking b3, in case Rook moves from the 3rd row. Which if I can find a non Q, non K move, I can force him to move away from the 3rd row. However, I can't find such move. Perhaps I didn't consider a5 long enough?} Qc1 {But I think this move should suffice too.} 56. Rg3 Qf4 {Finally pinned! He was avoiding it long enough. It becomes a formality from this point on.... almost.} 57. h4 Qxh4+ 58. Rh3 Qf4+ 59. Rg3 Kd2 {Has to move the King now (more or less, abc pawns are irrelevant).} 60. Kh3 Qh6+ {His King now has to separate from g2 pawn.} 61. Kg4 Qh1 62. Kf3 {By using this side to side checking technique I get to move my King closer and closer to the g2 pawn.} Qf1+ 63. Kg4 Ke2 64. Kh3 Qh1+ 65. Kg4 Kf2 66. Kf4 Qh2 {Rook pinned, Kf2 is there, and the game that should have been over long time ago finally finished the way it was supposed to after the early Q fall. However, never would I have thought I would have had to fight for it like this. For all intents and purposes this was a draw game. It took only my relentless analysis and end game maneuvering to get the win. Hats off to cw40832! Thanks for giving me hell even after you lost the Q. I learned a lot in this match about the early development, and positional advantage. I also learned (AGAIN) to not give up early and consider every option before resigning or accepting a draw.}
