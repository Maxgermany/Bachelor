[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence"]

1. e4 {My opponent starts off with the King's pawn opening. At this point, I decided to play an unusual, but well-known opening.} Nc6 {The King's Pawn Nimzovich Defence (B00).} 2. Bb5 {This wasn't one of the lines. 2.Nf3 and 2.d4 are continuations for this defence, and 2.b4 is the Wheeler Gambit.} Nd4 {Since my opponent wasn't doing anything much to my Knight (such as pinning the Knight to the King), I decided to strike back at his Bishop, an unnecessary idea.} 3. Bc4 {Aftre this, I chose not to chase the bishop any further, but I am setting myself up to win one of his two pieces.} e6 4. Nf3 {White's knight attacks my Knight, but instead of retreating it, I take White's Knight.} Nxf3+ 5. Qxf3 {Whatever I do, I should never play e5 until one of those two white pieces moves away. In the meantime, I am still trying to play d5.} c6 {I expected him to do 6.Nc3.} 6. O-O {However, he chose to castle.} d5 {I'm looking at 7.Bb3.} 7. exd5 cxd5 8. Bb5+ Bd7 9. Qb3 {I have no idea what White is trying to accomplish. If I had to take a guess, it would be that White is trying to achieve Queenside control.} Nf6 {I prepare in advance the old-fashion Kingside mate. Unfortunately, I started to worry about my opponent's attack.} 10. Bxd7+ {Believe it or not, this is another reason why I brought my Knight out.} Qxd7 {I couldn't decide which piece to take the Bishop with, the Knight or the Queen. } 11. d3 Bd6 {Perhaps 11...Be7 was better.} 12. g3 {This is another key detail about this game. My opponent created light square weaknesses that 1) he can't cover with his Bishop; 2) it is almost impossible for his Queen to cover these weaknesses in time.} O-O {I castle while I had the time to.} 13. Bg5 {Another useless pin, but I overreact to it.} Be7 14. Bxf6 {According to the pawn chain, White should attack Black's Kingside and Black should attack White's Queenside. This means that White is attacking the wrong side of the board. } Bxf6 15. Na3 {Instead of directing the Knight to the edge of the board, White should have done 15.Nd2.} d4 {I have no idea why I did this move, but I probably was trying to prevent 16.c4.} 16. Nc4 {Not a bad idea here for White, but he should be cautious about his next moves.} b5 {I attempt to attack his Knight.} 17. Na5 Rfe8 {I prepare to advance my passed pawn.} 18. c3 {I think I overreacted to this threat.} e5 {At least I'm scouting for an open file.} 19. c4 {Surprisingly, White advances his c-pawn.} a6 {I have an idea to take the Knight.} 20. cxb5 {As expected.} axb5 {White lost the Knight. If 21.Qa3 to guard it, 21...Be7 forces it away. Also, the Knight can try moving away, but it won't work. "A Knight on the rim is grim," as they say.} 21. a4 {Why would I take this rook pawn...} Rxa5 {when I can capture a free Knight?} 22. axb5 {I also nabbed the pawn} Rxb5 23. Qc2 {If I were White, I'd try 23.Qa4.} g5 {I didn't know what to do, so I plotted out a couple of moves.} 24. b3 {I definetely tried to get rid of the Queen (or chase it away).} Rc8 {With this, White chose to give up his b-pawn.} 25. Qe2 {25.Qb2 was better.} Rxb3 26. Ra6 Kg7 {I rushed to my Bishop's aid using the King. It's the endgame, right?} 27. Rfa1 {Now, I can attack my opponent's light square weaknesses.} Qd5 28. Qh5 {This move...does nothing.} Rxd3 {Perhaps 28...Rb5 is better.} 29. Ra1a5 {This leads to the key factor of this game, the 8th rank. When White played the wrong rook, he lost his control of the rank which I have a forced mate in two on. Also, White's King's escape squares were lost when I played 27.Qd5.} Rc1+ {So White resigned while I had two ways to mate him. White had the right idea, but he should have played 29.R6a5. }
