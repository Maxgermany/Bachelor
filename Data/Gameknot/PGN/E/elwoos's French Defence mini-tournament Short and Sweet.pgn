1. e4 {This is one of the games from my French Defence tournament. As you will see it didn't last very long. I set this tournament up as I knew nothing about the French defence, its proved to be an interesting experience.  Please feel free to comment} e6 2. d4 d5 {Starting position} 3. Nd2 {I must admit I don't really feel comfortable with this move but I wanted to see how it went} c5 4. Ngf3 cxd4 5. Nxd4 {The Gameknot database suggests exd5 is better } Nf6 6. exd5 Qxd5 7. Nd2f3 Bc5 8. Be3 Bd7 9. Nb5 {the only other game in the Gameknot database that got here had Be2 here which I guess implies this is a premature move but I quite liked it and had a feeling I might gain something out of it.} Bxe3 {This is a fatal blunder, black had clearly missed the threat of the royal fork on c7} 10. Nc7+ {Thanks for reading please comment}
