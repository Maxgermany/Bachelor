1. d4 {This is another annotation to help my friend understand where this game was lost and to learn from his mistakes.} Nf6 {I don't give my friend's real name, as I don't want his opponents to be able to prepare, so instead I'll give you his Gameknot name.} 2. Nf3 {Starts conventionally enough.} g6 {This is a sound way of meeting the white opening.} 3. Bf4 {White plays the trendy London system.} Bg7 {Black completes the fianchetto} 4. e3 {White opts for modest development.} d5 {This move is perfectly sound, establishing a pawn in the centre, although I personally would have played 4....0-0 followed 5....d6 and prepared to play e7-e5} 5. Nbd2 {White continues to develop.} Nc6 {Quite playable, but black rules out either c7-c6 or c7-c5 for the time being.} 6. c3 {White now has established a rock-solid pawn formation in the centre.} Bg4 {Sensible development of the bishop.} 7. Bb5 {And white responds to the pin with a pin of his own.} Qd7 {Black seems worried about having doubled pawns after Bb5xc6 and b7xc6 but there was no need to worry. Best was 0-0.} 8. h3 {White correctly puts the question to the bishop, probably the best move, but 8. Qa4 is also strong here. 9. Ne5 is a powerful threat and if 8....Bxf3 9. Nxf3 and 10. Ne5 is threatened. Black's best may then be 9....Ne4 in order to meet 10. Ne5 with Bg7xNe5 and white has the advantage - the two bishops are better than the two knights.} a6 {Bold play, counter-attacking the bishop on b5, but in fact a massive blunder, that white fails to exploit. White could simply take on c6 now. If black takes back then white can capture the bishop on g4 and if black continues with Bxf3, attacking the white queen, white has bishop takes queen WITH CHECK and goes a queen up.} 9. Bd3 {Fortunately white didn't take the chance.} Be6 {Black corrrectly doesn't exchange on f3, but Bf5 was slightly better, exchanging off his bad bishop for white's good bishop on d3. Black's light squared bishop is the bad bishop as it is blocked by the pawns on white squares, while the white bishop on d3 is a good bishop. able to weave in and out of the white pawns on black squares.} 10. Ne5 {White attacks the queen.} Nxe5 {Bravo! Clearly best is to remove the troublesome equine.} 11. Bxe5 {White takes back of course.} O-O {Another good move by black, getting the king safe. Equally good was c6.} 12. Nf3 {White brings his knight up to a more aggresive position than d2} Ne4 {This move is good too, exchanging off white's attacking bishop on e5 for the more passive bishop on g7. Fritz also like the plan of 12....b7-b6 followed by c7-c5.} 13. Bxg7 {So white takes.} Kxg7 {Black of course takes back.} 14. Ne5 {White also advances his knight.} Qd6 {Black keeps the queen active.} 15. f4 {White supports his knight on e5. This is a blunder as it leaves the g3 square weak. Better was 15. Qc2 or 0-0.} f5 {Black copies white, but this is a mistake. It leaves the Be6 a dreaful piece, blocked in by the pawns on d5 and f5. Much better was either pushing the white knight back with 15...f6 or taking advantage of the new weakness on g3 with 15....Ng3 attacking the Rh1. 16. 0-0 would of course be illegal, as the knight on g3 also attacks the f1 square, so the rh1 would have been forced to move and 0-0 would have been ruled out forever.} 16. Bxe4 {White correctly removes black's most active piece and prevents Ng3 forever.} dxe4 {This is the correct way to recapture, and the bishop on e6 now has influence along the a2-g8 diagonal.} 17. h4 {White boldly - and correctly - goes for the king-side attack.} h5 {Black decides to black the h pawn but in the process leaves the g6 backward, and white exploits this fact. However black is between the devil and the deep blue sea. Allowing white to play h4-h5 would have been risky with the consequential opening of the h file. Another option was to try and open lines in the queenside with 17....c5 or 17....Rf-d8 preparing 18.....c5 but it is hard to generate counterplay against white's rock-solid centre.} 18. Rh3 {White correctly mobilises the rook. The problem for black is that when the rook reaches g3, not only will the pawn on g6 be attacked, but also, because of the pin on g6 pawn by the rook, white will be threatening Qxh5.} Rad8 {This is a very plausible move, developing the rook from a8 to the semi-open d file. However black needs to do something about the threats on the king-side, so better was Rf6 protecting g6 and then 19. Rg3 can be met by Kh7 or Kh6 and black is still OK.} 19. Rg3 {So the rook attacks.} Rf6 {Black defends f6, but....} 20. Qxh5 {But the h pawn goes, and there is another attacker of g6.} Bf7 {In a bad position, black finds the best move.} 21. Qe2 {Now the threat is h4-h5. 21. Qg5 was also strong, keeping the queen nearer the scene of the action.} Rh8 {This is the best move on the board for black, but it doesn't actually stop h4-h5 as the g6 pawn is still pinned. } 22. Rh3 {This is a reasonable move by white, although the immediate h4-h5 was even better.} c5 {I can understand this move, trying to open up the position on the queen-side. Fritz prefers 22....a5 or 22.....b5.} 23. g3 {I don't like this move - it doesn't seem to do very much. Fritz likes 23. dxc5 here, the point being 23......Qxc5 is met by the knight fork Nd7 attacking Qc5 and Rf6. Fritz also likes 23. Nxf7 followed by 0-0-0 - the point being an immediate 0-0-0 loses the a pawn to Bxa2.} Be6 {Black avoids the exchange of bishop for knight and also covers the d7 square. Fritz prefers exchanging on d4 or 23....b5 but this move seems reasonable enough.} 24. a3 {White seems to be preparing 0-0-0. Fritz thinks that white can play 0-0-0 immediately - it is worth sacrificing the a pawn to bring the Ra1 into the game. Fritz also likes Kf2.} Rff8 {Black appears to be sorting out his position.} 25. Kf2 {This move seems inconsistent with white's last. Why not 0-0-0?} Rh5 {Black blocks the h pawn.} 26. Rg1 {So white instead prepares to advance the g pawn.} Bf7 {The position was hard to defend, but this makes it easier for white, as after g4 white can take back with the queen. Fritz prefers cxd4 or Rc8.} 27. g4 {So white advances.} fxg4 {Black takes.} 28. Qxg4 {With a threat of 29. QxRh5, exploiting the pin on the g file again.} Kh7 {So black moves the king off the g file, escaping the pin.} 29. Qd7 {An interesting move, of course if black takes the queen with 29....Qxd7 white has 30. Nxd7 forking rook on f8 and pawn on c5 and white would win a second pawn, and with it excellent chances of winning the game. Fritz thinks black's best moves are 29.....Be6 or Be8, but black goes down a different route.} Qf6 {Played presumably on the grounds of not exchanging pieces when materially down.} 30. Qg4 {This doesn't seem to achieve much - why not just take the pawn on b7, or play something like Rh-g3 going after g6.} Be6 {Black goes after the exchange.} 31. Qg3 {Which white concedes! better was taking on g6 with check, black has to take the queen, then white takes back with the knight attacking Rf8.} Bxh3 {So black snaps it off, and is back in the game.} 32. Qxh3 {White has to take back.} Rxh4 {Black takes a pawn.} 33. Qg3 {White threatens g6 again. White also has a threat of Nd7 forking queen and rook. I think time pressures were starting to play their part.} g5 {This is a bold thrust, taking advantage of the pin on the f file, but unfortunately it is the losing mistake. Black did have chances to save the game with Rd8 or Rh6. White could just win a pawn here, with 34.	Qxg5	Qxg5 35.	Rxg5	and if Rh2+ (going after the b2 pawn) 36.	Rg2, but white has something far better.} 34. Nd7 {This forking rook and queen.} gxf4 {Black counters by attacking white's queen, but....} 35. Nxf6+ {Unfortunately white takes WITH CHECK. White doesn't miss his chance this time.} Rxf6 {Black take back.} 36. Qxh4+ {Black resigns. It is mate after 36...Rh6 37. Qxe7+ Kh8 38. Qg7 mate. A sad ending to the game. Black started soundly, both players missed the white win early on. On move 18 Black seemed to miss that 19. Rg3 would threaten h5 as well as g6 and as a consequence went a pawn down. After that black fought back gamely, eventually won back the exchange, only to make a horrendous blunder under time pressure. Lessons from this - Good and bad Bishops Taking WITH CHECK Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
