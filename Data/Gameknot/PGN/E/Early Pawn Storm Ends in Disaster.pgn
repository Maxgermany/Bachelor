1. Nf3 e6 {Passive. Better would have been d5 or Nf6.} 2. Nc3 {Two Knights Tango. Leads to classical positions but surprises the opponent. } d5 3. e4 {Contesting for the center from the very start. } dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bd6 {Although the idea of retaining a stronger center on Nxd6 is good, black needs to watch for a pin on the f6 knight in the future. } 5. d4 Nf6 6. Bg5 Nbd7 7. Bc4 h6 8. Bh4 g5 {A damaging move. I have yet to castle to kingside. This may have been appropriate if I castled kingside. } 9. Nxf6+ Qxf6 10. Bg3 Bxg3 11. hxg3 e5 {Premature. Better would have been to develop the bishop on b7 and prepare for queenside castling.} 12. Qe2 b5 {The reason for this gambit was unclear to me. Maybe to shake off some pressure on f7,  but it does not seem validated. Black has ruined chances to castle queenside. } 13. Bxb5 O-O 14. Bxd7 Bxd7 15. Nxe5 Rfd8 {To keep active, black should have played Rfe8. } 16. Qh5 {Earlier mistakes begin to appear in their true form. } Kg7 17. O-O-O {Giving myself more ammunition before I make the final assault. } Qa6 {A desperate attempt for counterplay that only ends in mate or the loss of major material.} 18. Qxf7+ Kh8 19. Ng6+ Qxg6 20. Qxg6 {Lessons of the game:  1) Find yourself a solid home for your king before making a pawn storm.   2) Being solid also means remaining active and making your opponent uneasy by your counterplay. }
