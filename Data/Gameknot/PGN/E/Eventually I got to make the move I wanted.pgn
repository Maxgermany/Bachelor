1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. c4 Nf6 4. e3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nc3 a6 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Nf3 b5 {I wanted to play Bc4, but he didn't give me the chance.} 9. a4 {It seems like opening the a-file might be good for me since my rook and queen are both on the back row and the  bishop's already out of the way.} Rb8 10. axb5 axb5 11. Be2 Bd6 12. O-O O-O 13. d4 {I've got that open a-file but nowhere really to put the rook. I'm worried about him playing Nb4 eventually, and his queen is making it hard on my queen because of the pawn on b3. d4 is a theme in this opening, so let's see if it helps out.} e4 14. Ne5 Ne7 {I'm worried about him playing f6 to trap the knight.} 15. Ra5 {I don't see anything better, and this might work out okay. Now, if he plays f6, I can meet it with Bc4 and skewer the queen.} Bb4 16. Bc4 {He says he missed this move.}
