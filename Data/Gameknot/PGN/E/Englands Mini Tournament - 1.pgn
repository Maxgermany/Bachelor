[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {The King's Pawn opening. Allows me to make my first-choice move as black, as my queen and bishop can move to the sides of the board.} e5 {The King's Pawn game. My queen and bishop have some freedom, and control two of the diagonals.} 2. h3 {Does this move have a name? My opponent may have wasted a move here, as his rook can only move to one square...} d5 {...as I can now move my queen's pawn into the centre, and attack his king's pawn.} 3. Nf3 {He moves his kingside knight out to attack my king's pawn...} dxe4 {...so I capture his with my queen's pawn...} 4. Nxe5 {...and he captures mine with his knight.} Nd7 {Instead of moving my queen, I attack his knight with mine, hoping that he'd take it, so I can develop my bishop...} 5. Ng4 {...but he moves it back, for some pawn cover. Moving the pawn in front of the rook has given it some protection.} Ngf6 {So I now move my other knight out, connecting it with its twin, and attacking his...} 6. Bc4 {...but developing his bishop...} Nxg4 {...allows me to remove his knight...} 7. hxg4 {...in return for mine. I'm surprsed he doubled awns on g2 and g4, instead of moving his queen, as I can now target these pawns...} Nf6 {...which I do with my knight, targeting the one on g4...} 8. Be2 {...but I can no longer attack it, as the bishop has now covered it...} Bc5 {...so I now bring my bishop into the centre of the board to allow me to castle kingside...} 9. f3 exf3 10. Bxf3 {..and we trade pawns, but he still keeps the doubled pawns on g2 and g4...} Qe7+ {...so I move my queen out to attack his king...} 11. Qe2 {...he blocks with his...} Qxe2+ 12. Bxe2 {...so we exchange...} Nxg4 {...and I finally capture the isolated pawn on g4. See how the doubled pawns were a mistake?} 13. Nc3 Bf2+ {I now check with my bishop...} 14. Kf1 {...to force the king out of his starting square.} Bb6 {...so I now retreat my bishop.} 15. Nd5 O-O {What was I thinking, castling kingside...} 16. Ne7+ {...when the knight could fork my king and light-square bishop...} Kh8 {...forcing the king into the corner...} 17. Nxc8 {...allowing my opponent's knight to remove my bishop, exposing my knight to his bishop?} Raxc8 {So I capture his knight with my rook...} 18. Bxg4 {...but lose mine to his bishop...} Rcd8 {...and my rook must get out of its way.} 19. Bf5 g6 {I move my kingside knight's pawn to threaten the bishop...} 20. Be4 {...forcing it back...} c6 {...so I move my queenside bishop's pawn to safety...} 21. d3 {...he frees up his dark-square bishop...} f5 {...and I create a pawn chain on the kingside to threaten the light-square bishop again...} 22. Bf3 {...again forcing it back...} Rfe8 {...and I move my kingside rook into he middle to take the open e-file...} 23. b3 Bd4 {...and attack the rook with my bishop...} 24. Rb1 {...so the rook moves out of the way...} Bc3 25. Bb2 {...and my bishop is now pinned to the long diagonal...} Bxb2 26. Rxb2 {...so we swap. This was not a good trade for me, as I am behind on material.} Re3 {In an eventual attempt to win back material, I advance a rook to the 6th rank...} 27. Kf2 Rde8 {...and double on the e-file.} 28. a4 Re3e5 {I may have wasted a move here, but I keep my rooks connected...} 29. d4 {...but as the one furthest forward comes under attack from a pawn...} Re5e3 {... I move it up...} 30. Rbb1 g5 31. Bh5 Re8e4 {...and move my back rook to attack the unsupported pawn on d4.} 32. Rbe1 {With this move, I'm about to lose a rook...} Re3xe1 {...so I take one myself...} 33. Rxe1 {...and he completes the exchange. However, it is unwise of me to trade the other pair, as I am behind on material, and my king can move off his starting rank, should my opponent's rook land on e8.} Rxd4 {Also, my rook is needed to help hoover up enemy pawns, so I capture the exposed queen's pawn to halve the arrears...} 34. Re8+ {...and his remaining rook lands on my king's starting square, as predicted...} Kg7 {...but my king can escape it...} 35. Re7+ {...and he comes under pressure from my rook again...} Kh6 {...so I move him up to attack my opponent's bishop...} 36. Be8 {...so it moves onto my bottom rank, preventing my king from moving.} Rd2+ {So I check his king with my rook...} 37. Kg3 {...and as he moves his king to that square...} f4+ {...I do a hopeful check with my kingside bishop's pawn. I am hoping he'll do Kg4, so I can remove both the g2 and the c2 pawns...} 38. Kg4 {...but by sheer luck, that's exactly what he does...} Rxg2+ {...so I can therefore hoover up not one...} 39. Kf5 Rxc2 {...but two pawns, putting me ahead by four pawns for a bishop, giving me a fighting chance.} 40. Re6+ {As his rook checks my king again...} Kg7 {...I move my king back one rank, hoping to remove at least one of the rook and bishop.} 41. Rf6 Rc5+ {I check him again...} 42. Ke6 Rc3 {...and line up his queenside knight's pawn...} 43. Rf7+ {...but get checked myself...} Kg8 {...so I retreat my king to his starting rank...} 44. Kf6 Rxb3 {...and hoover up another pawn, putting me ahead by five pawns for a bishop...} 45. Rg7+ {...and as his rook checks me again...} Kf8 {...I attack his bishop...} 46. Re7 {...he defends with his rook...} Re3 {...so I attack his rook with mine. I wonder whether 47. Rxe3 fxe3 would have been any good, where I rely on my extra pawns to get a queen...} 47. Rxh7 {...but instead his rook removes my rook's pawn on the kingside...} Kxe8 {...and I capture his bishop with my king, as capturing with my rook would lose the game, with his rook landing in my near left-hand corner...} 48. Rxb7 {...but I also lose my queenside knight's pawn; however I am ahead by three...} f3 {...so I advance the one furthest forward to the 6th rank, for a promotion attempt...} 49. Rb1 {...and he moves his rook back to cover...} g4 {...but why did I move my pawn's neighbour to cover it, when f2 may have been more forceful?} 50. Kf5 {As a result, his king can close both down...} g3 {...so I advance my knight's pawn to the 6th rank...} 51. Kf4 {...and his king closes them down, along with my rook...} Ra3 {...so I move my rook out of the way to line up his last pawn...} 52. Kxg3 {...and lose my knight's pawn...} Kd7 {...so I advance my king up one rank...} 53. Rb7+ {...but it allows his rook to fork him and my queenside rook's pawn...} Kc8 54. Rxa7 {...and I lose the latter.} Kb8 55. Ra5 Kb7 {So I defend my queenside bishop's pawn...} 56. Rf5 Ka6 57. Rxf3 {...and lose my kingside one, but this time, with both of us having a rook and a pawn left...} Rxf3+ 58. Kxf3 {...I can trade the rooks, as my king is better placed: I can eliminate my opponent's pawn in two moves AND cover mine; he needs four moves to get to mine.} Ka5 59. Ke4 Kxa4 {I now clear his last pawn. Now as I have one pawn left, my king must stay ahead of it, until he reaches the 7th rank, or my opponent's king can cover the queening square.} 60. Kd4 Kb4 {My opponent offered me a draw, but I refused, as my pawn is not on a rook's starting file, making it promotable...} 61. Kd3 Kb3 62. Kd4 Kb4 63. Kd3 c5 {...but I wasted a couple of moves here, working out how to promote my pawn, finally moving it up to the 4th rank...} 64. Kc2 {...forcing my opponent's king away from it...} Kc4 65. Kc1 Kd3 {...so mine can switch to the other side.} 66. Kb2 Kd2 67. Kb3 Kd3 68. Kb2 c4 {Again I wasted two moves, finally advancing my pawn to the 5th rank...} 69. Kc1 {...forcing his king away...} Kc3 70. Kd1 Kb2 {..allowing mine to switch again, placing him on the 7th rank...} 71. Kd2 c3+ 72. Kd1 c2+ 73. Kd2 c1=Q+ {...to give my pawn a clear run to queen...} 74. Kd3 Qf4 {...allowing my new queen to close the king down...} 75. Ke2 Kc2 {...and I move mine to force him onto his starting rank...} 76. Ke1 Qd2+ {...so my queen can move onto her mating rank...} 77. Kf1 Kd3 78. Kg1 Ke3 79. Kh1 Kf3 80. Kg1 Qg2# {...then I move my king to his mating position, allowing my queen to get into hers.}
