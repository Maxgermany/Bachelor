[Opening "Giuoco Piano (C53), LaBourdonnais variation"]

1. e4 {King's pawn opening.} e5 {King's pawn game, my standard response.} 2. Nf3 {King's knight game.} Nc6 {Back to the king's pawn game.  Still nothing out of the ordinary.} 3. Bc4 {Still on the king's pawn game.  I personally like the Ruy-Lopez in this situation, but whatever.  To each his own.} Bc5 {Here's a new one for me, and it's apparently called the Giuoco Piano.  I'm not very familiar with this open, but it looked good from a development standpoint.} 4. c3 {Continuing the Giuoco Piano.  I was somewhat confused when I saw this move originally, but realized that it prevents my knight from moving to d4, which I would have liked to do.} d6 {Opening up my light bishop, keeping with the development.} 5. h3 {Now we break from the opening.  I don't really know what this move accomplishes aside from giving the knight an extra escape square.} Nf6 {Development, development, development.} 6. d3 {He opens up his dark bishop and protects his light bishop.} O-O {I wasted no time in castling here.} 7. Bg5 {He develops his bishop, and sets up a possible BxN trade.} h6 {I harass his bishop.} 8. Bxf6 {He starts the trade.  I'm not sure if he was hoping to disrupt my kingside defense, but if he was, it didn't work.} Qxf6 {Keeping my defenses intact.} 9. O-O {He castles.} Be6 {Now I go for the BxB trade.  I had thought about doing this a few moves earlier, but realized that it would cause me to weaken my defenses.} 10. Bb5 {He declines that trade, but sets up for a BxN trade.  Looks like it might wind up with my bishops against his knights.} a6 {Same thing I did on the other side.} 11. Bxc6 {He starts the trade again.  Maybe he has something against his bishops...} bxc6 {Maybe that trade wasn't the greatest idea after all.  Now I have my pawns doubled up on the c-file, but I am ahead in development.  Seems like a wash.} 12. b4 {Now he goes for my bishop.} Bb6 {No real harm done.} 13. a4 {I think he wanted to keep attacking my bishop here, but I wasn't going to let him.} a5 {So I block his pawn and set up for a pawn trade.} 14. bxa5 {He accepts.} Bxa5 {I finish the trade with my bishop.  Could've used my rook, but that would've given me no advantage in my attack.} 15. Ra3 {He moves to protect his c-pawn, which is already protected by his knight.} Rab8 {I try to get my rook onto a more active file.} 16. Nbd2 {There goes the knight.} c5 {I wanted to take this move back as soon as I made it.  It doesn't really hurt me in any way, but 16.d5 was such a better move in this situation.  I could've gotten a pawn off of the c-file and messed with his defenses.  It's not a huge difference, but I think that it would've helped some.} 17. Nh2 {He positions his knight for attack the next move.} d5 {Now I move to d5, but the reward isn't as great.} 18. Ng4 {Now he goes to attack my queen and currently unprotected pawn.} Qg5 {But no matter, I can protect it well enough.  I could've taken his knight with my bishop, but then I would've lost a pawn, and I wasn't willing to cede material at this point.} 19. exd5 {Now he accepts the trade.} Bxd5 {And I finish it.  I'm amazed that the material has stayed even for this long.  Usually, I'll do something to blunder away a pawn (or worse, a rook), or there will have been some gambit played.  But not here.} 20. f4 {Now he goes to attack my queen.} exf4 {But I capture instead.  So long even material!} 21. Nf3 {Another attack...} Bxf3 {... and another capture.} 22. Qxf3 {Now he gets his queen involved.} h5 {I go to harass his knight some, and hopefully force it back to the 2nd rank.} 23. Nh2 {There it goes.  I would've played 22...Nf6 here, because it gives the knight another exit square instead of trapping it on h2 for a few moves.} Rfe8 {Now I get my other rook onto an open file.} 24. Qxf4 {Now he goes for a queen trade, which gets us back to the even material.} Qxf4 {I accept the trade.} 25. Rxf4 {and he finishes it.} Re3 {Now I go to attack his pawns and get my rook into a forward position.  I figured barring 26.c4, he would lose a pawn, but he showed me wrong.} 26. Rf5 {He sets up for a trade (26... Rxd3 27.Rxc5 Bb6) that would give him a tempo advantage, which I wasn't willing to give him at this point.} Bb6 {... So instead I gave him that advantage without taking a piece.  Maybe I should've taken the trade.} 27. c4 {Now he saves his pawn.} Rd8 {I decide to set up for a possible rook trade.} 28. a5 {But he instead decides to attack my bishop.} Ba7 {Now he's got a solid tempo advantage.  He can dictate the attack and I'm on my heels for the time being.} 29. Rd5 {Now he sets up for the rook trade.} Rde8 {But I'm having none of that.  If I had taken it, the line would've probably looked something like 29...Rxd5 30.cxd5 c4 31.Rc3 and I would've been unsure what to do.} 30. Nf3 {Now he prevents me from playing 30... Re5+ and putting him in a tight squeeze.} c6 {Now I go to harass his rook.} 31. Rd7 {He attacks my bishop, but I think that he had a better move.  If he had played 31.Re5 I would've been forced to accept the trade or else lose one of my rooks, which would've stopped my attack.} Bb8 {I save my bishop and see a possible mate opportunity.} 32. a6 {Now he seems hell-bent on promotion.  But that may not be the best move in this situation...} Bg3 {Now, barring 33.Ra1, I have mate in two.} 33. a7 {He's too focused on promoting to notice.  Focusing too much on any one thing is often costly, as my opponent will learn shortly...} Re3e1+ 34. Nxe1 Rxe1# {And mate.  Now I think that I'm ready to face the day.  Better go get some breakfast...}
