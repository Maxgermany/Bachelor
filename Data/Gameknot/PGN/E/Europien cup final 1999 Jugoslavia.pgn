1. d4 d6 2. c4 e5 3. d5 g6 4. e4 Bg7 5. Bd3 Ne7 6. h4 {Good move , very effective after the 5...Ne7 , why ?! , because the idea of 5...Ne7 , 0-0, f5  exc exc which black usually plays in kings Indian defence , however white didn't castled on the kings side yet and it means that those kind of 0-0,f5... expose the blacks king position that cloud be very dangerous , there for white moves h4 , using the fact that the black knight is on e7 and not on f6 , because the knight on f6 if he will be forced , he will block the advanced h4 pawn to h5 , its only idea and it doesn't mean that both sides will play immediate moves .} Nd7 7. Nc3 f5 {This natural move is actually a mistake  and black is going to suffer , maybe better was 0-0 first  , safety of the king is very important and one of the main rules in chess , if its not enough that 7...f5? expose the king who didn't castled yet , its also create  a serious weakness on the dark squares on the blacks Kemp on the kings side . If  I was playing black here I would play 7...c6  and Wait to see what white is going to do , the idea is to move a5, Nc5 ,0-0,f5 ... , after 8.Nf3-a5.9.Be3-0-0... black steel have problems in developing however his only weakness d6 is hard to get , and even white is better , it steel takes to find a good plane to use it .} 8. exf5 gxf5 9. Bxf5 {Good move , taking a free pawn with no real compensation . Not 9.Qh5+? Kf8.10.Bxf5-Nf6 ... and white lost a piece for a pawn . } Nxf5 10. Qh5+ Kf8 11. Qxf5+ Kg8 12. Nge2 {Good move , the idea is to maneuver the knight to e4 through g3 , in this case the knight on e2 is more effective and useful than f3 due to that also avoids any attacks like e4 in the future for example 12.Nf3-Nf6.13.Qc2-e4... 14.Nxe4-Bf5....} Nc5 13. Qc2 Qf6 14. Ng3 Bd7 15. Be3 Rf8 16. Bxc5 dxc5 17. Nce4 {white diminates the board undesputedly .} Qe7 18. O-O-O Rf4 19. h5 Bh6 20. Kb1 {Avoides any discoverd checks .} Kg7 {the idea is to activete the other rook to f8 , 20...Kg7,Rhf8...} 21. d6 cxd6 22. Rxd6 {the white starts to invade blacks Kemp with his heavy Pisces .} b6 23. Rhd1 Bc8 {black choose to save the option of double his rooks on f file , while the bishop on c8 avoids Rd7} 24. Rd1d5 {Good move , white wishes to triple the battery on d file , where the white queen is used as a base for this battery ,which is going to be an unstoppable force . Rd6,R1d5, Qd3 .} Re8 25. Qd3 Qh4 {Maybe black is searching for check trough the 1st rank , Qh2,Qg1+ , and than exchange scarifies for open the diagonal h6-c1 for the bishop , but its to slow and no use . I think that its kind of an desperate moves to create something .} 26. Rd6d8 Rff8 27. Rxe8 Rxe8 28. Nd6 {Black resigns , white threats Nf5 next , attacks the rook on the same time and in the end will win a piece for free , 28.Nd6-Rf8.29.Nxc8.... if 29...Rxc8.30.Nf5+and the black queen dies . 29.Ndf5+ Rxf5.30.Nxf5+Bxf5.31.Qxf5 -Kg8... is also very good option  black have no choise but to resigh.}
