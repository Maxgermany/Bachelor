1. d4 {Another game from my QGD slav exchange tournament. This is one of the few that I was lucky enough to win} d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 {Tournament starting position} 4. Nf3 {I'm still not sure about this move at this point it seems passive to me, though of course it is a step towards castling} Nf6 5. Nc3 Bf5 6. Qb3 {As black has moves his lsb I can make some early threats, I am hoping to get my lsb on the a4-e8 diagonal as soon as I can} b6 {I'm not sure this is the best move for black I think I would probably defend the pawn with my queen, perhaps Qd7} 7. Bg5 {black is starting to look a little cramped} e6 {While this opens a nice line for the dsb it also prevent the lsb from defending the king} 8. e4 {Now I can finally get my lsb to b5} dxe4 9. Bb5+ Ke7 {I'm not sure I understand this move, the black dsb is looking very sorry for itself now, I was expecting something like Nb8-d7} 10. Ne5 {My knight is going to be tough to shift from there while the black f6 knight stays where it is though of course it can't currently move} Qd6 {Looking to free some space for the king, I have the white squares around it dominated, I just need to work out how to claim the black ones too} 11. Bf4 {Threatens to gain the queen with something like Nc6+} Qxd4 12. Rd1 {Now Nc6 is even more tempting if it wasn't for the black knight on b8, I considered Bc6 which would gain material but in the end I wanted to trap the black king in, the black queens options are limited now} Qc5 13. Na4 {And now black is doomed, its hard to see how he can save his queen or the game} Qc8 14. Qb4+ Qc5 {forced} 15. Nxc5 bxc5 16. Qxc5# {Thanks for reading please feel free to comment}
