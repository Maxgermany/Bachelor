1. e4 {Played at the Emerald City Open in Seattle, 2011.  Igor was not only rated 340 points higher than me, he's also over 20 years younger.  So I had my work cut out for me in this game.} c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 {The Grand Prix Attack.  Aggressive, but not completely solid.  Fortunately I was well prepared against this opening, having a friend who plays it consistently.} e6 {The idea is to play d5 quickly, forcing white to either allow the exchange of the e-pawn or push e5, which immobilizes the center.} 4. Nf3 a6 {It's necessary to keep white from playing Bb5, as the pin on the knight interferes with the d5 push.} 5. Be2 d5 6. exd5 {White opts to exchange.  This breaks up his attacking formation, and leaves the f-pawn looking somewhat off-sides.} exd5 7. O-O Be7 {Blocking against checks on the e-file after Re1.} 8. Kh1 Nf6 9. d4 {This looks inaccurate to me (even though Fritz doesn't find anything wrong with it), since it allows Ne4, doubling white's pawns.} Ne4 10. dxc5 {Since both Nxe4 and Bd2 drop a pawn, this seems to be best.} Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bxc5 12. Nd4 {Here I decide that my plan will be to drum up counter-play on the c-file.} O-O 13. Nb3 Be7 {The bishop needs to retreat here, rather than to b6, in order to help defend against white's forthcoming kingside attack.} 14. Bf3 Be6 15. Be3 Bf6 16. Qd3 Ne7 {Heading to f5, and opening the c-file for my rooks.} 17. Bd4 Nf5 {black will meet 17. Bxf6 Qxf6 18. Bxd5 with 18. ... Bxd5 19. Qxd5 Ne3, with a nice fork.} 18. Bxf6 Qxf6 19. g4 Ne7 20. f5 Bd7 21. Nd4 Rac8 {Finally I have time to start bringing my rooks to the c-file.} 22. Rae1 Rc7 23. Qe3 Nc6 24. Qf4 Rfc8 25. g5 Qd8 26. Bxd5 {white misses his opportunity to gain an advantage with 25. g6!} Nxd4 27. cxd4 Bb5 {a nice finesse} 28. c4 Bxc4 29. Bxc4 Rc7xc4 30. Re4 Qc7 {Now my plan bears fruit.  With my heavy pieces in position on the c-file I have sufficient counter-play to neutralize his attack on the e-file.  My task is made easier by the weakness of white's kingside on the diagonals - a weakened king position is the price white paid for his early aggression. } 31. Rfe1 Qc6 {Forced.} 32. Kg1 {Freeing the rook.} Rc1 33. Qxc1 {It doesn't seem to make much difference what to capture with, most of the heavy pieces are coming off either way.} Qxc1 34. Re4e8+ Rxe8 35. Rxc1 Kf8 {Protecting e7, which will allow me to defend the 7th rank.} 36. Rc7 {Fritz evaluates this position as a dead draw.  During the game I considered playing Rd8 and hoping the advanced g & f pawns would turn out to be vulnerable, but wisdom got the better of me and I opted to avoid any further complications against my higher-rated opponent.} Re7 37. Rc8+ Re8 38. Rc7 Re7 39. Rc8+ {Drawn - which was a moral victory for me as all my other recent outings against experts have gone into the loss column.}
