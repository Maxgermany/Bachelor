[Opening "Petrov (C42), classical attack"]

1. e4 {At this point I want to thank nuntar whom I invited to indulge me in the Main Line sequence.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 f5 {5... f5 ?! The starting position of my experimental line. I have searched the GK database and Lasha Janjgava's book "The Petroff" for this position. I can safely say this is an ignored continuation of the Classical Petrov. GK computer analysis indicates it is weak (-0.34) but apparently it is not a blunder. I am not discouraged by this score (yet) because "book" positions in other openings are similarly weak.} 6. Bd3 {Not an unexpected response. OTB I have also seen 6. Bb5+ c6, 7. Bd3.   Edit: White avoids Nc3 Nxc3, bxc3 and the doubled pawns. Perhaps White SHOULD let Black double the pawns to gain breathing space?} Be7 {The only viable move. Black's plan is simple - hold the 4th and 5th ranks with minimal pieces and develop quietly. The e4-Knight is meant to annoy rather than attack.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 d5 {Black would rather not commit the pawn to d5 because a hole opens up on e5 but again, this is the only viable move I have found so far. } 9. c4 Be6 {White begins to chip away the edges of Black's stronghold. GK analysis gives White the advantage. This position resembles one typical of Petrov games except the Black Bishops are now on the e-file instead of the d-file.} 10. Nc3 dxc4 11. Bxe4 {Huge mistake here by White. GK analysis gives its best continuation as: 11. Nxe4 cxd3 12. Nc3 Bc4 13. Ne5 Bd5 14. Qxd3 Bb4 15. Nxd5 Qxd5 16. Re2 Na6 17. a3 Ba5 18. Bg5 Rae8 (-0.76). White's game goes downhill from here.} fxe4 12. Nxe4 Bg4 13. Ned2 Nc6 14. h3 Bh5 {Black has attained full development, the Bishop pair + Knight vs 2 Knights (1 pinned) + bad Bishop, spatial advantage, and a semi-open f-file. White has cleared the middle and grabbed the e-file with the Rook. However, White has no immediate attacks against the exposed Black King and cannot expect to keep his isolani alive.} 15. g4 Nxd4 16. Nxd4 Qxd4 {White still cannot capture the Bishop on h5 because of the threat to f2. } 17. Ne4 Qxd1 18. Rxd1 Bg6 19. Nc3 Rae8 20. Be3 a6 21. Rd7 {This move allows Black to neutralize White's active Rook as follows...} Bd6 {The Bishop temporarily cages the Rook while putting a bead on the White King.} 22. Na4 Rf3 23. Bc5 Rxh3 {The rest of the game is inconsequential so I will end the annotation here. This annotation was meant to stimulate discussion about the possibilities, feasibility and flaws of the  5.f5?! line of the Classical Petrov. I use it in blitzes when possible but most players I meet here avoid the Classical Petrov completely with 3.Nc3. Have any other Petrov players explored this option? Please comment. Thank you.  } 24. Bxd6 cxd6 25. Nc3 b5 26. a3 Be4 27. Nxe4 Rxe4 28. Rd1 Rxg4+ 29. Kf1 Rh1+ 30. Ke2 Re4+ 31. Kf3 Rxd1 32. Kxe4 Rd2 33. Ke3 Rxb2 34. Rxd6 Rb3+ {White resigns}
