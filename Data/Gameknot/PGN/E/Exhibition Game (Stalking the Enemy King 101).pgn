1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 {Italian Game.} 4. b4 {Evan's Gambit. White cedes material for rapid development.} Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. O-O Nf6 {Black leaves the book. 6...d6 was the play.} 7. Ba3 {Develops and prevents enemy castling.} Bb6 {? Again, 7...d6 was better.} 8. d4 {Steinitz initiates the action.} exd4 9. Qb3 {! f7 is a target of opportunity.} d5 {Logical - center is staked, light squared bishop now active, and the attack on f7 is slowed.} 10. exd5 {Creating a totally open file white will rush to.} Na5 {! Looking to break up the threat along the a2-g8 digonal.} 11. Re1+ {We all saw this coming..........Black must interpose the check and lose a piece, as 11...Kd7 gets  messy after 12.Bb5 .} Be6 {Black opts to sac his bishop, and probably hopes to castle queenside.} 12. dxe6 {!! Steinitz sacs his queen! A six move combo of death is unleashed.} Nxb3 13. exf7+ {1} Kd7 14. Be6+ {2} Kc6 15. Ne5+ {3} Kb5 16. Bc4+ {4} Ka5 {[16...Ka4 17.BxN  Ka5]} 17. Bb4+ {5} Ka4 18. axb3# {6! A real gem of a mini! The calculating ability of Steinitz was really incredible. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas}
