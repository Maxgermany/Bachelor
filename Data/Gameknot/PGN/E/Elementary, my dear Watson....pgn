[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), English defence"]

1. d4 b6 {He played several times this defence. My approach to fiachetto's are to... be careful, but play as it doesn't matter.} 2. Bf4 Bb7 3. Nd2 {Now I am "threatening" e4. It has his downsides, though. } e6 4. e4 Nf6 5. g4 {?? A blunder that should have costed me the game. It didn't. } Nxe4 {Hard thinking: how to "save" my Rh1. Be careful about ...Qh4.} 6. Nxe4 Bxe4 7. f3 {Qh4+, Bg3 is now possible, and holds. For the time being. } Bb7 8. h4 {Trying to justify somehow my previous sacrifice. A pawn move, yes, but...} Qf6 {? My opponent reurned me the favour with this. My pieces are well placed where they are...} 9. Bg5 Qg6 10. Bd3 f5 {From here, the game is a tactic excercise. } 11. gxf5 exf5 12. Qe2+ Kf7 {Only move to survive. Good. Now... Bc4+ comes to mind, but it fails after d5, blocking. Nh3, Nf4 is too slow and black has Bd6 coming. Qe5 comes to mind, but, exactly, Bd6... Fails, because THEN there is no defence against Bc4. Found!} 13. Qe5 {Threatens Qxc7, Bxf5...} Qe6 {! The logical one, and best. I didn't have time to avoid it all. But my advantage has not vanished. I just have to be sure the exchange leaves an edge to me. And this is not QxQ (I'll have pressure on e6, but not all that definitive. I can get more from this). If Bxf5, after the Q's exchange he'll be able to play Bc5, getting strong pressure... but I sensed it was handable, with his K so weakly placed. I couldn't caculate, of course. I had to trust on my "nose".} 14. Bxf5 Qxe5+ 15. dxe5 Bc5 {As predicted. Now, BxN and he grabs f3, finally... but this won't be of any help! Nb8 is blocked (or Bxd7). He can play the Rh8 to e, but Bf4 will cover it... and e6+ is coming soon. } 16. O-O-O {Threatening d7, but my intention is not to take it, of course. My B pair is too strong, and he will soon kick it out if I leave time to do so. I thought my opponent will go for the pawn, opening for me the f column. } Bxg1 {? A clear example of a situation in which winning a single pawn is far too costly. } 17. Rhxg1 Bxf3 18. Rdf1 {Now what? } Be2 {I already have Be4+, BxR, RxB+, Kmoves, BxR. I also have Re1, but Bc4, and e6 is not deadly anymore. And after this, there is no discovered check. So the choice was rather sadistic...} 19. Rf2 Rf8 {? This doesn't help black. Threatening any of the bishops won't work either. Maybe the "less worse" was Nc6, but Bxd7+ was the end of the story. Bc4 doesn't help after b3, Be6, Bxh7+, Ke1, Bg6# (if I'm right: no analyze board when commenting!)} 20. Bxd7+ {From here is very simple. Maybe he got a surprise when he saw I didn't get the a8 R...} Kg8 21. Be6+ Kh8 22. Rxf8# {...but those are still the nice combinations one has to master - and the ones that make chess so beautiful. }
