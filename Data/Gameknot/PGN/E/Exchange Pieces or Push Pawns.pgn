[Opening "Amsterdam attack (A00)"]

1. e3 {This game was a lot of fun, so I'd thought I'd try writing another annotation. There are certain to be many errors here, but only through practice can we improve. This opening sequence started as Amsterdam attack until 2 b3, h5} e5 2. b3 h5 {I read up up another opening called the Anti Borg where white rams the h side pawn up black's throat to obstruct him from castling king side. I thought it might be fun to see if black could do the same. } 3. Bb2 {white continues with the Amsterdam by pressuring the king pawn} Nc6 4. Bb5 {Good move by white, at this point I realized this opening was going poorly. } Bd6 5. Nf3 {White is definitely winning in tempo} f6 6. Nc3 Nge7 7. Ne4 {Here White makes a minor mistake. Instead of Ne4, I would either castle or push the queen pawn to c5. The knight can't do anything, even though black's position is too clumped, the knight can only take the bishop which as we'll see doesn't do much good. } a6 8. Nxd6+ cxd6 9. Bxc6 dxc6 {This was a poor piece exchange. White has fixed black's position from me. } 10. h4 {This move doesn't make much sense either. That pawn is no threat to white in any sense. Even if white castles king side, that pawn would be overextended because black cannot afford to do anything other than get the bishop and the queen out of the bank rank. Black has to castle queen side because a decent pawn push king side will tear his line apart and expose the king. } Bg4 11. e4 Qd7 {White is wasting time. Bg4 is no attack, it's just the best place to put the bishop. } 12. Qe2 {White realizes he needs to castle, but he no longer has tempo. } O-O-O 13. O-O-O f5 {here comes the pawns. } 14. Qd3 Bxf3 15. Qxf3 Rdf8 {the advantage of pushing pawns becomes clear. Because black pushed first, he can use his knight, rook, and queen to support the pawns. White is basically playing defense with the queen. } 16. exf5 {Bad move. } Rxf5 17. Qg3 Nd5 {Another bad move. Attacking the pawn gives black an excuse to move the knight. The advance of that knight is going to be decisive. } 18. f3 {Why? I see no reason why white does this. He needs to get the rooks in the game. } Nf4 {White now has to react to black, the initiative has passed from black to white. Ne2 is fatal.  } 19. Rhe1 Rg8 {Getting the second rook in play. } 20. Kb1 {Why does white do this? Perhaps so the rooks can move out, but this is the wrong way to do it. Rg3 is better, allows white to put rooks on the same line. } g5 {obvious} 21. Bc1 {Why do this? Perhaps to exchange later? But white does not have time. } Qh7 {White is in deep trouble. } 22. hxg5 Rfxg5 23. Qf2 Rg5xg2 {Ng2 doesn't threaten the queen. And I want to keep the Queen moving, it prevents white from getting his rooks into the game. } 24. Qe3 h4 {White has a small window to defend. Rf1 would probably have been the best move. } 25. d3 {WHY? This move is such a waste. Does white want to trade rooks? He can already do that, Rg1 would have potentially forced the exchange. } h3 26. Reg1 {Too late. } h2 27. Rgh1 {The knight turns this from an even position into a route for black. } Ne2 {threatening Ng3. White thinks he sees a way out. } 28. Qh6 {Nope} Qxh6 29. Bxh6 Rg2g1 30. Rdxg1 hxg1=Q+ {Minor mistake. Rxg1 gets me a queen instead of a rook. But damage done} 31. Rxg1 Rxg1+ 32. Kb2 Rf1 {White decides to keep fighting. I move to eliminate the isolated pawn. } 33. a4 Rxf3 34. b4 {pushing pawns } Nd4 35. Kc3 {Not a good choice. } Rf2 {Threatening mate. } 36. Bd2 {White does not want to surrender the pawn. But the bishop is now stuck. He can't move to check the black king and if he moves anywhere else the result is checkmate. } d5 37. a5 Kc7 38. b5 Nxb5+ 39. Kb3 {White resigned here. Like to thank him for a well fought game. The moral of the story here is I think to avoid exchanges which simplify a crappy position. Instead, push pawns. }
