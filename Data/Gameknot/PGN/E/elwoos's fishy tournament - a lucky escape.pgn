1. c4 {Another game from my Halibut gambit tournament} b5 {Starting position} 2. e4 {This was one of the first games I played as white and this seemed a more interesting move than accepting the pawn.} b4 3. d4 e6 4. Qa4 {Probably a premature move however I was looking to maintain my centre by pinning the d pawn} a5 5. Nf3 Bb7 6. Bd3 {Perhaps not the best place for the bishop but it does line up against the king side where I am expecting black to castle} Be7 7. O-O Nf6 8. Bf4 O-O 9. Qc2 {My queen no longer serves a purpose where it was, from here I can threaten to annoy the pawns in front of blacks king with a simple e5} g6 {This allows me to tuck my bishop away at h6 when I choose} 10. Nbd2 c6 {I'm not sure what black is attempting here - all this seems to achieve is to block in his lsb and give his knight no good places to go} 11. e5 Nh5 12. Be3 {I didn't want to force blacks rook to e8 just yet so this was my only other choice, looking at it now it seems a pretty weak move.} d5 13. Bh6 {This just makes my previous move look even more silly.} Ng7 {I'm not sure about this move, I expected Re8} 14. Be3 {waste even more time with my bishop} Nd7 15. Kh1 {This strange looking move is part of a plan to get my knight to f4 to put even more pressure on the g6 pawn} Rc8 16. Ng1 c5 17. b3 Nb6 18. Nh3 Nf5 19. Bxf5 exf5 20. Qb2 a4 21. dxc5 Bxc5 22. Bh6 {Moving back to where it should have stayed all along, now e5 threatens Qg7#} Re8 {The rook was temporarily safe where it was, now only the queen is protecting the f6 square where he could block my plan} 23. cxd5 {Trying to tempt the queen out, though I am expecting the knight to take.} Qxd5 {White's threat of Qxg2 is easily parried} 24. Nf4 {This is a mistake on my part, Nf3 would have been better} Qxe5 25. Qxe5 Rxe5 26. Nd3 Re2 27. Nxc5 Rxc5 28. bxa4 Nxa4 29. Rab1 Rb5 30. Rbc1 Rc5 31. Rcb1 Rb5 32. a3 Nc3 33. Rb3 Bd5 34. Rxb4 {Another wasted move on my part, this makes my last move a waste of time.} Rxb4 35. axb4 f6 36. h3 g5 37. Nb1 Ne4 38. Kg1 Kf7 39. f3 Nd6 40. Nc3 Rd2 41. h4 Kg6 42. Bf8 Bc4 43. Rd1 Rxd1+ 44. Nxd1 Nb5 45. hxg5 fxg5 46. Kf2 h5 {I need to watch those pawns but I am hoping I can get my passed pawn moving} 47. Ne3 Bd3 48. Be7 g4 49. f4 Nc3 50. Ke1 Ne2 51. Nd5 Bc4 52. Bg5 h4 53. Ne3 Kh5 {I thought at the time this was a mistake but now I am not so sure.} 54. Nxc4 {My knight is now far from the action and black can push his pawns forward.} h3 55. gxh3 {pretty much forced, at this point I figured I could get my king in fast enough to prevent promotion} gxh3 56. Kf2 h2 {Probably better was Kg4 but this would allow me to push my b pawn.} 57. Kg2 {black resigned. Thanks for reading please comment, in particular if you can see a way that black can promote here. }
