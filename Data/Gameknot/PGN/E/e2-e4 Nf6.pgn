1. e4 {This is a wild game because white plays very sloppy in the beginning. However, White wins in a pretty queen sacrifice. } Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. f4 {this is known as the vennia openning which is not very good for white. I choose to play it here because I wanted to do something different. In the past, I used to play this openning in tournaments and had good results against weaker opponents.} d5 {A great move that creates a vey dynamic centre.} 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. fxe5 {a bad move that does not deal with black's major of ...Qh4. I needed to play Nf3 } Qh4+ 6. g3 Nxc3 {ouch man I really needed the knight} 7. bxc3 {as a general rule it is always better to capture toward the centre} Qe4+ {good bye rook} 8. Kf2 {the most stubborn defence} Qxh1 9. Nf3 Nc6 10. d4 {defending e5 and freeing the dark bishop} Bg4 11. Qe2 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qxh2+ {This is where black goes off the tracks. Black should continue to trade peices, simplify the game and head into a favorable endgame. Instead he allows white to consolidate and retain an advantage of space which I take full advantage of.   } 13. Bg2 {Now black has run out of checks and his queen is out of position} g6 {?? a massive blunder that loses because of white's superior mobilty better is:13. ...Be7 denying white the d8-h4 diagnonal  } 14. Bg5 {!! black's king is now stuck in the centre and white is suddenly winning} Qh5 {?? Black is totaly oblivious to what is coming next. } 15. Qxc6+ {Boom. And this bomb goes off in the black camp like a nuck. Black is left scratching his head and wondering what just happened }
