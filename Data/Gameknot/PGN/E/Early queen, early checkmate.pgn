1. e4 e6 2. d4 Qf6 {A rather quiet first move for Black, but this second move is rather curious.  Interesting.} 3. Be3 d5 {An attempt to prosecute a delayed attack.} 4. e5 Qe7 5. c4 {An attempt to press forward and gain superiority over a more open center.} Qb4+ 6. Qd2 Qb6 {Defeats the aggressive alternative 6...dxc4, beaten by 7. a3 Qb6 8.Bxc4.} 7. a3 c6 8. b4 g6 {Black has missed White's bridge to be built, attacking the Queen.} 9. c5 {White has a strong queenside position, attacking Black and getting a good stonewall position far into Black's side of the board.} Qc7 10. f4 Nh6 11. Be2 Qe7 12. g4 Qh4+ {White has made a small mistake and now stands to lose a pawn.} 13. Bf2 Qe7 {Black is arguably incompetent and misses a good chance, allowing White to continue on the offensive.} 14. g5 Nf5 15. Nc3 Bg7 16. Nf3 O-O {Black has few good attacks and really ought to shore up his defense, but instead moves his king to a place which is not well defended.} 17. Nh4 Na6 18. Nxf5 exf5 {Black's dinking around has allowed White to clear off Black's pesky knight.} 19. h4 Bd7 20. h5 gxh5 21. Rxh5 {Now we can see the writing on the wall.  Nonetheless, 21...h6 would force 22.gxh6 Bxh6 23. Rxh6 Kg7 forcing a retreat and allowing for some possible Black action to save a draw.} b5 {What in God's name is Black doing, anyway?} 22. O-O-O Nc7 23. Rdh1 {Not quite Alekhine's gun, but a strong attack on } Ne6 24. Rh5xh7 f6 {The first good move Black's made. } 25. gxf6 {Probably the best line for Black is 25...Qe8 16. fxg7 Nxg7 and the game is not totally lost.} Qf7 {Instead Black pins his king in.} 26. fxg7 Nxg7 {Even there, capturing with the Queen was essential.} 27. Rh7h8# {I think the game speaks for itself.}
