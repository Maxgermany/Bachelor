[Opening "Sicilian (B78), dragon, Yugoslav attack, 10.O-O-O"]

1. e4 {1.e4 remaining as the all time favourite move to begin the game with, no matter are you beginner or grandmaster you are going to face this best-by-test move more than any other opening move. But back to the game, my opponent decided to go for this instead of playing 1.d4 which was his main opening move(I would have tried to go for kings indian defence if that would have happened).} c5 {My main defence against e4. I play other moves here too but it is a good rule when facing a stronger opponent on paper to go for the opening which you know the best.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {My absolute favourite of all times, Dragon variation, which is also regarded as one of the most complicated openings employed in modern practice. Back in early days of Dragon, the moves to begin with were much more different: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 and after 6. Be2 g6 black would have successfully got where he wanted(move order was developed from avoiding c2-c4 marcozy bind and attacking move e4-e5 when they were used against the imaginary d6, e7, g6, h7 formation resembling Dragon constellation). Modern move order was found after response 6.Bg5 against old move order cause 6...g6? 7.Bxf6 exf6 is no good.} 6. Be3 {This move(we should say formation f2-f3, Bc1-e3, Qd1-d2, 0-0-0 cause Rauzer started it with 6.f3) was first demonstrated by well-known player Vsevolod Rauzer. It is beginning of organised attack on the kingside with already mentioned formation.} Bg7 7. f3 {With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack), white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside. Less common replies in use here are 7...Nc6 and 7...a6(which are sometimes called anti-rauzer cause black delays castling counting on other benefits like first bringing pieces on queenside where white intends to castle).} O-O {Most common reply, "Come on, I am not afraid of your attack on king's flank". Black is going to trust on his counterplay which he can get from queenside.} 8. Qd2 {There remains continuation 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Qe2 which is just "wrong" cause true spirit of Yugoslav attack is to go and see who checkmates first! But the continuation I gave there is to go up against blacks counterplay on queenside.} Nc6 {Black is ready for the battle, counterblow in the center that is. So white is going to either allow it by playing 9. 0-0-0, prevent it by 9.Bc4 or be a haymaker and go for 9.g4.} 9. Bc4 {Some call this a modern approach of this opening as after many games and research done with the move 9. 0-0-0 this is regarded as the best shot by white to get the advantage in game(keep in mind, that in openings you never know when old moves come into fashion again. There is surely room for new ideas in 0-0-0 variation, you just have to find them). This move is to prevent any ...d6-d5 plans while developing light-squared bishop to its most active diagonal. So what white is planning then? Long castle, h2-h4-h5, Be3-h6 if needed, launching attack against black king.} Bd7 {Alright, I am not going into details with other possibilities as 9...Nxd4, 9...Nd7, 9...Na5, 9...a6 or 9...a5(if this would be introduction of opening, then yes). Bishop move ...Bd7 is a flexible choice in this position, black has lot of possibilities. For example, there is knight manoeuvre possibility ...Nc6-e5-c4(without developing queen before it cause simply saving tempo).} 10. O-O-O {And white continues the plan I introduced. If you want to try something else here then go for 10.Bb3 cause immediate 10.h4 Rc8 11.Bb3 Ne5 leads to transposition(unless you are planning to delay castling then maybe some difference).} Rc8 {Black has to start working on his own counterplay queenside. There is nothing else now that we have come here so thematic c-file control in sicilian is a great way to start it.} 11. Bb3 {I don't believe there is much anything else. 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bb3 is not recommended as it doesn't give anything and black can even sacrifice pawn for an initiative: 12...b5!? 13.Bxa7 Qa5 14.Bd4 b4 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nd5 Bxd5 17. exd5 Rc5 and chances are usually on the side of player who is having more active bishop in cases where bishops are different colour included with other pieces on board.} Ne5 {And continuing with manoeuvre plan aiming for c4. White has now option to go for interesting 12.Kb1 which is prophylactic king move(when I was younger we used to joke about these as "GM moves"). Other interesting possibility is to play 12. Bg5 where white wants to play e4-e5 break cause of a pin on d-file. Main continuation is 12.h4 which we shall see in the game.} 12. h4 {Flank attack, following the spirit of this opening and starting the attack against black king.} h5 {Black weakens his castled position which should not be done if following general rules. Reason of this move is not to prevent g2-g4 advance cause it will come at some point anyway. But the reason is to delay it and make white to prepare it first. Question is: Can black achieve anything during that duration. 12...a5 is another move reducing blacks possibilities and 12...Nc4 is played here frequently.} 13. Bg5 {Here white had several possibilites: 13. g4, 13. Kb1, 13. Bh6, 13. Rhe1, leading to a different game. White goes to threaten knight protecting g2-g4 break and also narrows blacks counterplay possibilities.} Rc5 {Now this is interesting move which needs an explanation. Here has been tried 13...Nc4 but it doesn't look promising after 14. Qe2 Na5 15. Kb1 and white is happy to set attack on the kingside(1-0, Nunn - Mestel, London 1986, can be taken as example game). This rook move is unusual in Dragon but wonderful possibility in this position, prepares b7-b5 and scouts important squares on 5th rank.} 14. Kb1 {14.f4 and 14.g4 are other two moves used here which are more like risking everything. King move is safer option but useful one at this point. Other options let black too easily to get counterplay with knight manoeuvre e5-c4.} b5 {Preparation is done so I started my play on queenside by pushing a pawn.} 15. g4 {Yeah! This is what Dragon should be, typical plan in opposite-castled position, you have to be first with the attack!} a5 {Instead of going 15...hxg4, the sharpest continuation and where every move values extremely high, I decided to go for other accepted idea here which is to get a-pawn threaten bishop while it's not the only reason. Other plan is to get a-pawn to a3 and open up diagonal h8-a1 for bishop in some scenarios.} 16. gxh5 {All makes sense, white continues his attack.} a4 {16...Nxh5 would be the other move here which is a passive method dealing against whites attack by defending. Most likely the move played here offers better possibilities for black to actually do something.} 17. h6 {From what I heard this move is nowadays considered as intermediate move. The move which is considered to be stronger move is not hard to find that is 17.Bxf7(Schmidt - Varga, Germany 1991, white got strong attack with 17.Bxf7 Kxf7 18.hxg6+ Nxg6 19.h5 Ne5 20.Qg2 Rg8 21.h6 Bh8 22.f4 Nc4 23.Qh2 Nxb2 24.Rdg1 Rxc3 25.h7 Rg6 26.f5 Rxg5 27.Rxg5).} Bh8 {Forced move nothing too interesting.} 18. h7+ Nxh7 {Again, forced.} 19. Bd5 a3 {Okay, now this is some sort of novelty. Move that has been tried here instead of this is 19...b4 where black should be doing just fine. But as I mentioned earlier this move is to increase power of dark-squared bishop(and yes it does some damage around whites king) so idea to play this came quite naturally into my head in this game. How much I spent thinking the move 19...b5 as I do have some analysed lines in my old notes... well, I can still remember this like yesterday that I was simply too excited to find out where 19...a3 leads and didn't spend much time on 19...b5(I want to show you funny execution in here 19...Qc7 20.Bxe7 Re8 21.h5 Rxe7 22.hxg6 Nxg6 23.Rdg1 Nhf8 24.Nf5 Bxf5 25.exf5 Bxc3 26.fxg6 Re1+ 27.Qxe1 Rxd5 28.Qe4 Qc4 29.Qe8 fxg6 30.bxc3 g5 31.Rh8+ Kxh8 32.Qxf8+ Kh7 33.Qf7+ 1-0 and German player Hausrath was defeated in fashion by the best ranked player from Estonia nowadays, Kaido Kulaots, in wch U16 1992)} 20. Bh6 e6 {I didn't like 20...Re8 21.h5 e6 22.hxg6 Nxg6 23.Bb3 axb2 24.Rdg1 which seems to give white good chances. So instead I went for ...e6 immediately and maybe lose the exchange but this path seems to give black possibilities(certainly better than 20...Re8 which asks for trouble).} 21. Bxf8 {White decides to grab the material. 21.Bb3 would have been another choice and its hard to determine which one is the more accurate one between these two(hopefully someone finds the reason). Maybe 21.Bb3 would be the right choice by keeping dark-squared bishop on kingside for possibilities or that is what I have started to believe more I look this position. Problem with 21.Bxf8 seems to be that it just throws the fuel out and white can't create anything but aslong as his bishop stays on board it can be nasty for black. One example would be 21.Bb3 Re8 22.h5 g5 23.f4 b4 24.Nce2 Ng4 25.Bxg5 Nxg5 26.fxg5 Nf2 27.g6 Nxd1 28.gxf7+ Kxf7 29.Rxd1 Qg5 and now white has 30.Qxb4 otherwise it would be better for black but now it leads to whites advantage.} Nxf8 22. Bb3 {Now we get to the same point but white doesn't have his bishop and this doesn't look bad for black.} Bg7 {Now this looks weird move. The reason why I wanted to do this is that in some scenarios in chess it is not good to give opponent change to do check and develope a piece to good square same time(in here rook to g1 and check same time).} 23. h5 gxh5 {This is already looking dangerous for black(if you look deeper in position you might disagree) but 23...gxh5 is the only option, what else, and now we see a quite odd thing. Rook that was played to c5 square suddenly eyes this pawn aswell. White can't go for 24.Rxh5 cause black just goes 24...Nxf3 25.Nxf3 Rxh5. From how the game goes on it might be that 24.bxa3 would have been the right move as a-pawn is going to be troublesome in this game.} 24. f4 {?! I just don't know what was going in head of this guy. He decides to change his light-squared bishop to my knight while opening lines front of his king. Maybe he had seen something I didn't? or is it that white doesn't have better ideas like maybe just playing knight to e2 or rook to g1 and I can't see much wrong in those options.} Nc4 25. Bxc4 {This would make more sense if I take with Rook here: 25...Rxc4 26.e5! and he would get my h-pawn while keeping comfortable position.} bxc4 26. f5 {? So was this what white planned with f-push? makes even less sense as it doesn't seem to be doing much and I have hard time accepting that title player would go for this. Maybe there were snakes he saw and nobody else did?} Qb8 {! This had to be done now. Leading to forced sequence of moves after which black has his dark-squared bishop in great position towards white king and possibilities of using his h-pawn. And when you add the fact that black wins a pawn by clearing white pawns that stand on squares e4 and f5 this is starting to look really good. } 27. b3 cxb3 28. cxb3 exf5 29. exf5 Bxf5+ 30. Nxf5 Rxf5 {Now after seeing this position arising it makes me think would it have been any difference if white would have gone 28. axb3 keeping pawn on c2 to maybe(?) prevent ideas against his king.} 31. Rhg1 {Maybe rook would have been better on e-file as black has possibility to just close the g-file now with knight.} Ng6 {This is beginning of interesting and one of my most successful endgames. There was no reason to accept draw. The truth might be that black can't win this but as so often in games with these kind of chances you might sometimes earn the prize by trying. Black has a3-pawn in nasty position preventing whites play and three passed pawns from which h-pawn should be used in order to make possibility for chances. So maybe the earlier bxa3 would have done good for white(and that f-push included with losing those pawns on center was just terrible).} 32. Nd5 {? This might already lead into lost game for white cause of possibility to play 32...Qe8 and when analysed further it seems to be really good for black. 33.Rde1 Re5 34.Nc3 h4 for example is promising. So what else if not 32.Nd5... it seems that rook move 32.Rc1! would be the move that could save the game like if the game would continue 32.Rc1! h4 33.Qd3 Rc5 34.Ne4 Rxc1+ 35.Rxc1 Qe8 36.Qd5 there is good chances for draw. Maybe black has some other possibilities but 32.Rc1! must be strong move here.} Qb5 {Straight ...Qe8 was the right plan but this doesn't throw it away yet and black still has possibility to play queen to important e8 square. If white goes for move 33.Rge1 preventing queen from moving to e8 then it seems black can maintain advantage by playing 33...h4 34.Nc7 Qb6 35. Re8+ Kh7 36.Nd5 Qf2 37.Re2 Qg3.} 33. Qg2 Qe8 {! Black is probably winning now.} 34. Rde1 {Now what else? 34.Rc1!? seems like alternative try but after 34...Qe5 35.Nc3 h4 36.Rc2 there remains another ace 36...d5!} Re5 {Only move, for example if black goes 34...Qf8 then white gets into the game after 35.Rc1 Kh7 36.Ne3 Re5 37.Qf3 Qe8 38.Nc4 Qe6 39.Nxe5 Qxe5 40.Rg2.} 35. Qd2 {Rooks needs to be protected.} Qe6 {Focing knight to move away from center.} 36. Nb4 {Forced and now black is winning. Probably 36...Nh4 does the same  thing as the move I played in the game.} Rxe1+ {! Absolute stunner!} 37. Rxe1 {Maybe 37. Qxe1 would have been better by simply offering trade of queens to draw the game(if you know you are losing it is sometimes worth trying even stupid stuff). Black of course shouldn't change queens then but instead play 37...Qf6.} Qf6 {Using the power of mighty a1-h8 diagonal.} 38. Re2 Qa1+ {38...h4 might lead into won game aswell.} 39. Kc2 Qb2+ 40. Kd1 Bc3 {This move had to be made otherwise white manages to hold. For example 40...Qb1+ 41.Qc1 Qxc1+ 42.Kxc1 just throws it away.} 41. Qxb2 axb2 {Not 41...Bxb2? cause white has rook and this forces white to give knight away.} 42. Kc2 {42.Re8+ Kg7 43.Kc2 Bxb4 44.Kxb2 Ne5 and black wins.} Bxb4 43. Kxb2 d5 {!} 44. a3 Nf4 45. Rc2 {45.Rh2 can be tried here as it will lead to game where black needs to play carefully if he wants to win the game. So I am going to introduce one long variation right now for that: 45.Rh2!? Bd6 46.Rh1 Be5+ 47.Ka2 Kf8 48.a4 Ke7 49.a5 Kd6 50.Ka3 Kc6 51.Ka4 d4 52.b4 d3 53.b5+ Kb7 54.Kb3 Bc7 55.a6+ Ka7 56.Rh4 f5 57.Kb2 Be5+ 58.Kb3 Ne6 59.Rxh5 Nc5+! 60.Kc4 d2 61.Rh7+ Ka8 62.Rh1 Ne4 63.Rd1 Bf4 64.b6 Nf2 65.Rb1 d1Q 66.Rrxd1 Nxd1 and black wins.} Be1 46. b4 h4 {Black must push h-pawn in order to win this.} 47. Kb3 {47.b5 doesn't help anything 47...h3 48.b6 Bg3 saves the day for black.} h3 48. Rh2 Bg3 49. Rh1 h2 50. a4 Nh3 51. a5 Nf2 {This all has been just playing moves out nothing too interesting but now at first it might look that white has brilliant idea which unfortunately doesn't work} 52. a6 {White plays his last hope to get a queen on table.} Nxh1 {This had to be played now and not to react whites idea of promoting queen.} 53. a7 Nf2 54. a8=Q+ Kh7 55. Qxd5 {White is already in position which can be resigned but this good example how to win this position with black and something like this could be found from some endgame manual even(yes, I am flattering myself cause I was and still am so happy about this game.)} h1=Q {No surprise, now it is just playing.} 56. Qf5+ Kh6 57. Qf6+ Kh5 58. Qxf7+ Kg4 59. Qg7+ Kh3 60. Qh7+ Kg2 61. Qb7+ Kg1 {My friend mikey45 asked here why white doesn't trade queens. I agree, that would be the best try but black manages to stop b-pawn from promotion without losing a piece(just in time). Then it would be bishop+knight checkmate pattern.} 62. Qf7 Qe4 63. Qg7 Qf3+ 64. Ka4 Nd3 65. Kb5 Qd5+ 66. Ka4 Kg2 67. Qc3 Bd6 68. Qg7+ Kf2 69. Qc3 Ke2 70. Qc2+ Ke3 {And white resigned, showing that title players are not immortal(even against patzer like me). Black made few small inaccuracies which lost him the game: maybe trading the bishop to rook and not taking a3 pawn earlier in the game where bad choices and f3-f4-f5 push was something horribly wrong. Endgame which arose was really nice for myself to get a win out of it(feels good). Hopefully you find this game exciting aswell. I won't say it is 100% won endgame but it is clear that black is playing for win, which I did!}
