1. e4 c5 {Mini tournament, I'm playing black and begin with the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qb6 {The Grivas Variation. I'm not sure what motivated this move, other than that I found it in the GK DB. I have no analysis of this line.} 5. Nb5 a6 {Still according to the DB, choosing the path with the fewest draws. I hate draws. Unless I'm losing and play for one. But I never choose drawish opening lines if I can avoid them.} 6. Be3 Qa5+ 7. Nb5c3 e6 8. Be2 b5 {Still from the DB, only now I'm playing moves that seem to favor white more than black. I think that was a mental lapse, and I was cycling through so many new games where I was playing white that I was just in the habit of picking moves for white (I had just joined two mini tournaments and was white in almost all of those 8 games).} 9. Qd2 b4 {Off the reservation now. No more DB. I decide to hunt the knight since he has nowhere to go but back to the back rank.} 10. Nd1 Qe5 {A stupid move. I thought I was forking two pawns, e4 and b2. Not my brightest moment, since I just drove the knight to d1, I should have seen that it defends b2 from there. The move (10. ... Qe5?!) isn't exactly bad, so I get away with it. But it was poorly motivated and a better developing move might have been called for.} 11. Bf3 Bb7 12. O-O Bd6 {A cheapo. I never expected to get the checkmate on h2, but the move develops the DSB with a tempo. Still, would have been a fun quickie if white had been careless.} 13. g3 Be7 {After gaining a tempo with the checkmate threat, I decided to bounce him back to e7, though right now, annotating the game, I don't remember why. Howeer, I think I had plans to advance my d7 pawn and needed the bishop out of the way.} 14. c3 Nf6 {Not 14. ... bxc3. White's knights are stymied on the back rank, capturing on c3 just invites one of them to come out and play. Much better to develop with a threat.} 15. Bd4 Nxd4 {White miscalculated, and now he loses a pawn.} 16. Qxd4 Qxd4 17. cxd4 Nxe4 {Not only did black gain a pawn, but white's queen pawn is now isolated. I may like this Grivas Variation, even if I didn't play it well, wasting time with non-forks and bouncing bishops. I'm sure, along the way, there are moves white would rather have played differently too.} 18. Re1 f5 {A tough call. 18. ... f5 or 18. ... d5. I went with the move as played (obviously), choosing to not block the a8-h1 diagonal, though I was sorely tempted to liberate by backward d-pawn and get him into the center.} 19. a3 d5 {And then I gave into temptation. White had his own LSB on the long diagonal, so it's not likely that the black LSB will find much to do with it anyway.} 20. axb4 Bf6 {Sure, I could grab that pawn on b4, but it's now isolated and doubled, and the d4 pawn is more of a prize - oddly enough, white has no move on the board that will save his pawn.} 21. Nbc3 Bxd4 22. Na4 Rc8 {Not sure why the white knight chose a4, limiting its mobility to only three squares all covered by black's DSB. Black seizes the open file.} 23. Bxe4 fxe4 {Again beset with choosing between the f-pawn and the d-pawn. This time, I decided to keep the passed pawn on the d-file and open a half-open f-file aimed at the pinned f2 pawn.} 24. Ne3 O-O {Not so much getting to safety as connecting rooks and getting a rook on that half-open f-file.} 25. Rac1 Rxc1 26. Rxc1 Rc8 {The open file seems more vital than the half-open file right now, so black contests white's right to own it.} 27. Rxc8+ Bxc8 28. Nc2 Bf6 {I considered 28. ... e5, defending the bishop and inviting an exchange. I felt that trading off the two white knights would leave a strong endgame for black, with his passed d-pawn and kingside pawn majority, while the lone queenside pawn can bottle up whites doubled queenside pawns. However, after consideration, I decided that as long as the DSB is on the long diagonal threatening white's b2 pawn, white's knight is trapped on a4. This seemed like a better strategic consideration than simply inviting an exchange (an invitation that might be declined anyway). Turns out, the strategy dissolved in two more moves, so it didn't really matter either way.} 29. b3 Kf7 {Feels like an endgame. All the major pieces are gone and strategies are forming around promoting pawns. Although, with 11 pawns and 4 pieces on the board, it also feels a bit like a middlegame, too. However, I make an endgame decision that it's time for the black king to join the party. Threats against white's queenside pawns may give the black king an avenue to get in front of his passed d-pawn and bring him home to d1.} 30. Nc5 Ke7 31. Kf1 Kd6 32. Ke2 e5 {Needed to shut out the white knight and king from d4 and f4.} 33. Na3 Kc6 {33. Na3 might be the beginning of the end for white. I believe his plan was to play 34. b5, but black's king move prevents that. Net result is white has to go back to c2, thus wasting two moves giving black time to continue his advance.} 34. Ke3 a5 {Sneaky. If I do say so myself, 34. ... a5! may be the winning move. The lone isolated pawn invites white to capture it, undoubling the white pawns and giving white supported passed pawns on the queenside - but it will cost white a knight (35. bxa5? Kxc5). I had to think about this one long and hard. First, could white win with a pair of supported passed pawns on the queenside? After playing out lots of continuations, I decided he could not. Black's king and bishop pair could dismantle those pawns quickly enough to not lose ground on the kingside or in the center. Second, could white sacrifice his knight on e4, destroy black's center, and then safely capture on a5 forcing black to divert time and resources to stopping the white queenside pawns while black's king rampages through black's remaining pawns? Stay tuned...} 35. Nxe4 axb4 {Not 35. ... dxe4? which loses to white's 36. bxa5 followed by 37. Kxe5. As played, 35. ... axb4 leaves both white knights en prise. White must decide which to save, and regardless of his decision, he does not gain the queenside passed pawns he needs to win. Instead, black gains material and a more easily winnable endgame.} 36. Nc2 dxe4 37. Nxb4+ Kc5 {Normally it's a bad idea when a knight has your king in check to approach the knight on a space diagonal to that knight. It usually allows the knight to retreat and give check at the same time. But in this case, both squares that allow white's knight to move with check are covered (d3 and a6) so white can only retreat the knight.} 38. Na2 Bb7 {Saving the black pawnon e4.} 39. Nc3 Bg5+ {White's king only has one retreat. Even doubled and isolated, the two black pawns in the center are working together to limit white's king's mobility. White had planned to gain the pawn on e4 with 40. Nxe4 Bxe4 41. Kxe4. This would almost force black to waste time with his king dealing with white's passed b-pawn, giving white time to hassle black's kingside. End result would be three pawns each, with white having a superior pawn structure and black having a bishop. That could end in a draw. However, as played, white's king must retreat away from the black pawns, and then black wins a pawn with 40. ... Kb4, leaving black with a material advantage of bishop+pawn, enough to win. Seeing this, white resigned.}
