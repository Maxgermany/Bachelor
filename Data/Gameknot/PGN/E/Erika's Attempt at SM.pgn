[Opening "Bishop's opening (C23)"]

1. e4 {Like me, Erica opens with the King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {And, black responds with the King's Pawn Game.  Now, if I were black, I would have responded with the Sicilian Defense because of what happens during the next two moves..} 2. Bc4 {This is her first mistake and what I am talking about.  Knights are supposed to be developed before bishops because you know where the N is supposed to go but not the B.  Normally, that is almost irrelevant, but this is going to make a huge difference later on, as we will see.  The reason for 1...c5, as opposed to 1...e5 is because if 2.Bc4, 2...e6, to cut the bishops diagonal.  BTW, I am not saying this because of the Game DB, at all.  It is actually because I reviewed this with Jack Stockel, when an opponent plays 2.Bc4, in hopes of SM.  At first, Mr. Stockel advised me to immediately respond by bringing the Knight out (with 2...Nf6).  Then, I talked to him about a different version of the French Defense, and he studied the positions.  A couple of minutes later, he told me that 2...e6 is even better.} Nc6 {Interestingly enough, black decides to develop.  As mentioned on my last note, it would have been better to develop with the other Knight.  To me, however, that is totally irrelevant.  Why?  At his level, all that matters is development, and that is what he's doing.  As we will see momentarily, he will bring the other Knight out, momentarily.} 3. Qf3 {? This is her first big mistake.  In this position, she is attempting the f7 tactic.  In a different game, Erika lost because her opponent mated her, with the Four Move Trick.  In some cases, you want to use other peoples strategies and tactics, to defeat them.  For example, I used easy19's tactics and strategies to mate a different opponent, after getting, "Freddied", as jstevens1 calls it, as illustrated by Joann and I.  However, in this case, you don't want to use people's strategies or tactics for obvious threats like SM.  @goldmedal20: There is problem with this move for two reasons.  First, this threat is straightforward, and it is easy for almost anyone to see this threat, even novices.  Having said that, I have the same question for you that the reaper1 asked me, in previous annotations.  Did you think that your opponent would allow this mate in one?  Second, your Queen is out way too early.  Even I, do not bring it out by my third move.  Why?  Because you waste time by bringing this piece out, while your opponent continues to develop his minor pieces.  Later on, that Queen will get attacked, as you will see, momentarily.  So, in this case, trying to follow your opponents tactics and strategies, for this type of mate is, "the evil way to do things", as one of my coworkers would say.  Because of what I mentioned, it is important to develop and follow basic principles (General Opening Principles), before going for obvious tricks, like this.  BTW, principles are not absolute rules, but they are general guidelines to help you develop.  However, the most important principle is do not bring your Queen out before your other pieces have been developed; and that should be followed, except for extenuating circumstances.  In most cases, however, there's no compensation for bringing the Queen out early.  In addition, this is an example of unsound aggression.  What is unsound aggression?  Unsound aggression=aggression that does not harm your opponents position.  It is also aggression that does not acheive anything because you look for the most straightforward threats, so it is easily spottable.  More often then not, unsound aggression actually backfires and harms your position, and that is going to happen, later on.} Nf6 {Since ...e5, this is his best response to the threat.  In addition, he is developing, while white just wasted time, by bringing her Queen out early, as mentioned in her last move.} 4. g4 {I do not know she moved there, but this is another mistake, for two reasons.  First, she made it unsafe to castle Kingside.  Most importantly, however, is the fact that this move will allow Thom to attack her Queen.  Therefore, best was 4.Ne2 as it develops and keeps her Queen protected.  Now, black is much more developed then white, as a result.} Nd4 {Therefore, black is continuing to punish white for, "Poor Opening Play", as cdeburca calls it.} 5. g5 {?? Unaware of what's going on, white decides to attack his Knight.  However, she overlooks that her Queen is under attack.  Therefore, this is her loosing blunder, as she looses her Queen and a pawn for his d4 Knight, after 5...Nxf3+.  @goldmedal20: Bringing your Queen out early, is what ultimately led to this problem because of what I mentioned, earlier.  } Nxf3+ 6. Nxf3 Nxe4 7. O-O {? Now, she decides to castle.  Normally, castling is solid, but, this time, there is a problem with that.  g5 was played, before this move.  So, it's too little, too late.  Why?  This move exacerbates the position as it exposes her King.  Instead, white's focus should be to castle Queenside, as opposed to, Kingside.  The only problem is that her Queenside is completely undeveloped.  In other words, she did not get her other pieces out.  @goldmedal20: In general, you want to get your pieces out ASAP, and that is why there are General Opening Principles.  What are General Opening Principles?  Basically, they are a set of guidelines to help you develop and get your pieces out quickly.} d5 {! At first glance, this move looks dubious.  In reality, however, it is anything but a waste of time.  Before, his bishop was blocked, so that he would later have to waist time in order to complete development and get it out.  However, this is solid at it attacks her LSB and mobilises his other pieces.  Note: mobilization is the most important aspect of chess, as haile1996, mentioned in a previous annotation.} 8. Bd3 {So, she responds by attacking his Knight.  The only thing is, however, that black has other plans.  What are they?} Bh3 {This is it!  Black responds by attacking a piece much more valuable then a Knight, her Rook.} 9. Kh1 {?? However, white misses the threat.  In this position, best was 9.Re1, as this move protects her Rook and puts pressure on the e file.  This move, however, looses a lot more material, after 9...Bxf1.} Bxf1 10. Bxf1 {So, she looses a Rook and pawn, for a bishop.} Nxg5 11. Nxg5 {After that, she takes.} Qxg5 {Then, he retakes.  The thing is, however, that it is generally not a good idea to exchange material, when you are behind.} 12. f4 {? So, she responds by forking his Queen and e5 pawn.  However, that does not matter or bother black, in any way.  In fact, this move is another mistake, as it looses an additional pawn.} Qxf4 {Now, white must be careful, or black mates in one.} 13. Nc3 {?? And this is her final mistake.  I don't know why she moved there, but 13.Bg2 was her only option.  Either way, the game is lost, but 13.Bg2, would have prevented an immediate mate in one.  Now, black has an inevitable mating move, after 13...Qxf1#.  } Qxf1# {Here's the moral, Erika. You are supposed to develop your minor pieces (Knight followed by bishop), before the Rook+Queen.  In fact, your Queen should be the last thing that comes out.  As shakertjie would say, "your main goal should be to develop, develop, develop".  Disobeying General Opening Principles and not following the basics, will get you in trouble, as you saw, in this game.  That is because, "What you do in the opening will affect you in the middle game; what you do in the middle game will affect you in the endgame; what you do in the end game will affect the final result", as chesskingdom64 would say.  Also, patience is of a virtue.  You lost your cool and patience, as you wanted a quick ending, to this game.  In most cases, being impatient will cause problems, inside and outside of chess.  In addition, do not always follow the same tactics and strategies because it looks easy.  Afterall, "it's not so easy", as Jack Stockel would say.  In the other game, the opponent was lucky because he or she made mistakes, that you did not see.  In this game, however, you made mistakes that your opponent did see.  Having said that, it is not a good idea to assume that your opponent will not see the threat.  Instead, it is important to realise that your opponent will see your intentions.  Afterall, your opponents plan are just, as important as, your own.  That was illustrated here.  Remembering this lesson will bring you one step closer to improving your chess skills.}
