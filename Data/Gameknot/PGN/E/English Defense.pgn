1. c4 {This game introduces me to the English Defense, a response that Kosten seems to imply is underrated (esp considering it's only used in 1 out of 80 English openings!) and chessgames.com bears him out with black winning as often as white for games in their database.} b6 {The idea here is to fianchetto the QB the same as in a Queen's Indian Defense, this of course would tend to counter the KB fianchetto of White's.} 2. Nc3 {Unusual second move out of Kosten's book, not the usual 2. g3.} Bb7 {Develops the QB.} 3. e4 {This was the idea behind the second move, to establish the KP at e4, this allows for the KB to develop without incident as well as reinforcing control of d5.} e5 {A reply not covered in Chapter 16 of Kosten's book.  His favored line for Black uses a 'hedgehog setup' with 3...c5.  Possibly this is a 'tit for tat' response to my 3. e4.} 4. Nge2 {Develops the KN earlier than the text does, now if Black plays 4...Bb4 then 5. a3 refutes.} Be7 {Prepares to castle K-side.} 5. g3 {Fianchettoes the KB.} Nf6 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O {White has very strong control of d5 at this point, also has shared control of d4 due to Black's c-pawn hanging back.} Nc6 {This vies for control of d4, had I moved 7. d3 instead of castling could now counter with 8. Be3....} 8. d4 {....instead I get my Q into the mix by playing 8. d4, counter to Kosten's strategy of securing the center with d3 then pawn-storming the K-side.} exd4 {This of course invites an exchange of pawns...} 9. Nxd4 Nxd4 {....followed by an exchange of N's....} 10. Qxd4 Bc5 {....with an ensuing conquest of the entire diagonal containing d4 by Black's KB!  This is a rather disappointing turn of events considering....} 11. Qd3 {....my f-pawn is now pinned to my K and my pawn-storm must be put off for now!} Re8 {Put off indefinitely is more like it as my insecure center appears to have attracted some notice by the opposition.} 12. h3 {Makes way for the K as well as keeping Black away from f2.} Rb8 {This allows for the QB holding its own versus White's KB should White decide to advance his KP.} 13. Bd2 {A bit of a problem this QB, would prefer to move QR to e1 before moving B any further out.} Qe7 {Oh lord, this is beginning to look dangerous....} 14. Rae1 {....but if my figures are right it should hold (maybe).} d6 {Was expecting something worse than this, think he was worried about his undefended c-pawn.....} 15. a3 {.....unfortunately his KB has been boxed in!} a5 {Fair enough!  Will have to find further resources.....} 16. Nd5 {.....in fact have managed to make good use of the awkward QB, how serendipitous can it get?   Meanwhile the QN attacks Black's Q!} Qe5 {Expected an exchange, but Black means to maintain pressure on the e-pawn as well as to threaten White's Q-side AND K-side!   In fact, there is quite a lot going on at this point, would be forgivable to miss something I would think!} 17. Bc3 {This chases the Q away from the Q-side.....} Qg5 {.....she decides to go K-side!} 18. b4 {Now, about that KB....} axb4 {....first the exchange....} 19. axb4 {....now what?.....} Nxd5 {......why, a big trade of course!....} 20. exd5 {....first the N's.....} Bxf2+ {....followed by a kamikaze attack!....} 21. Kxf2 {....(here I needed to be careful lest my g-pawn fall prey to the black Q)....} Rxe1 {....and now for the R's....} 22. Rxe1 {....and White is a piece to the good!  Strangely, there are some recurring themes from my previous English opening, in particular the black Q at g5 potentially threatening my rear.} h6 {No doubt an escape valve (only the white Q has it covered!)} 23. h4 {This was to encourage the black Q to retreat....} Qd8 {.....which she does!  (sigh of relief)} 24. Qe4 {Nice spot for my Q, occupies the open e-file in front of the R, hope to get the KB behind her on the light-squared diagonal, with the QB's dark-squared diagonal to be held in reserve.} Ra8 {Now the QR threatens my rear....} 25. Ra1 {....this seems the easiest way if not the best.} Rxa1 26. Bxa1 {Still have my B's at least.} g6 {This seems like an invitation....} 27. Qd4 {....switch over to the QB's diagonal....} f6 {....Black's only saving move....} 28. Qxf6 {....decide to trade down....} Qxf6+ 29. Bxf6 {Down to our B's.} Kf7 30. Bd8 {More serendipity, certainly I never planned any of this (did I?)} c5 31. dxc6 e.p. {Was maybe hoping I would forget about en passant, no I don't think so, and look at where my KB is placed, wonder how that happened?  (pure luck I tell you!)} Bc8 32. Bxb6 {What luck!  (Black wishes I would trip and fall into a fumarole)} Ke8 33. b5 {My plan here is to block out the black K and make an end run with my b-pawn.} Ke7 34. Ke3 {This is just some insurance, in case he advances his d-pawn and I advance my rear c-pawn, might need to protect it.} Bg4 {Might have thought I would advance my forward pawn.} 35. Bc7 {This dispelled that notion.  Black resigned.}
