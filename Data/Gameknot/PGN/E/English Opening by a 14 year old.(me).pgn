1. c4 {The English Opening; i had never used it before and had not enough time to study it, but i wanted to try it out first.This is to try to claim the d5 square from the wing.This also prevents the reply d4, leading to the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfield defences.Thus, i saw this as a flexible choice for a start.} g6 {2.d4 is what white usually plays in the English opening. 1...g6 is preparing for a fianchetto of the king's bishop.} 2. b4 {I immediately played b4 to be able to bring my C-pawn ahead, which was not well played in my opinion.It can also attack a Knight when developped. This leads to a loose game which brought some difficulty. b4 also allows fianchetto attacking my rook.} Bg7 {As said before, a fianchetto is on its way!} 3. Nc3 {This seemed the best move for white. Somehow, this turned into my advantage due to black refusing the center.} Nc6 {Nc6 tries to retake the center.Fortunately the B-pawn is here to scare off the knight.} 4. b5 Ne5 {The knight has to look for refuge and e5 seems a safer place.} 5. Nf3 {Nf3?! i was looking for an early exchange but did not realise that c4 was unprotected.I also did not develop another pawn that will weaken my structure.} Nxc4 {In the end, c4 turns out a bait.} 6. e3 {e3 opens diagonals for the queen as well as bishop.This as an immediate response and i don't know if this move was good.} Nh6 {Black does not see the threat and develops another knight.After thinking for some while, i deduce that it's not intentionally played.The bishop captures the knight.} 7. Bxc4 {2-point advantage.} Nf5 {I was lost at this move.King safety first, so i castle.I knew he was trying  Nd6 but i would be able to counter.} 8. O-O Nd6 9. Qa4 {Exactly what i had imagined! Queen to d4 protected both pieces and it was protected.} b6 {The b-pawns have no-where to go} 10. Bd5 {I save the bishop to d5, attacking the rook.} Bb7 {exchange?? No objections..} 11. Bxb7 Nxb7 {I wanted the knight to c5, so i took a risk and played Qa6.} 12. Qa6 {If the rook moves,i take the pawn. If it doesn't, i take the knight.Queen to c8 or b8 would seem better but this would bring too many pieces to the queen side of the board.So Black retreats to c5.} Nc5 13. Qa3 {This is an unquestioned move if i want to save my queen.} a5 {Should i have captured by en-passant?? No, Rb1 is better.} 14. Rb1 e5 15. e4 {I block the pawn, stopping the bishop threat by the diagonal.} Nd3 {If black wants, he can capture the bishop.I prefer losing it on b1so my rook may stay on the b-file.} 16. Bb2 Bh6 {Threat to d2; but my knight is protecting it.} 17. Nd5 {Nd5! Here I'm expecting 17...c6 18 bxc6...dxc6 19 Nxb6(threatening the rook) and...Qxb6  I Would then move my bishop out of the way to e5 to win the rook due to black saving his queen.} g5 {I knew g4 was next. Then i saw the knight waiting to be captured.} 18. Qxd3 {I seized at the opportunity!} g4 19. Bxe5 {Bxe5!! A rook for knight, i think not.} Rg8 {th rook is brought to g8 to support the pawn.} 20. Nxc7+ {I saw a mating opportunity;had i moved Nf6 to win the rook,I would haveallongated the game and bear the risk to lose.Instead, Nxc7+ was the best move. It was also the first check of the match.} Kf8 {Ke7 would have let me play Qd7 and mate.. Instead, black moves king to f8, a blunder again.The only possible move to continue the game is Qxc7 and capture of the queen with the bishop.Nevertheless, black played Kf8.} 21. Qd6+ {I chuckled; i knew it was a sure win! Only possible move here is queen to e7.} Qe7 22. Qxh6+ {Check again.. this is a forced mate. Still, only move here is Rook to g7.} Rg7 23. Qxg7# {Checkmate! This is my first win here in 23 turns with 15 point advantage. From a pretty bad opening, this comes to an exciting middlegame and nice mate.}
