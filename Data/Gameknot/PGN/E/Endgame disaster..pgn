1. d4 {My Endgame pledges me once again after this game.  Something I need to work on.  Though this lead to a very complex endgame that only favored white slightly.  Feels nice competing on a equal level up till move 29. still wish this could have been a win.  Great game well played dilly. Those interested in the analysis of the game here it is http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15301496&rnd=0.0028041210025548935 } Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4+ 4. Nc3 {This move isn't that hot though nothing wrong with it as it leads to a Nimzo Indian.  I would have preferred book with Bd2 I think.} c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 O-O 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. e4 d6 10. Be2 b6 11. e5 {Bb7 would put uncomfortable pressure on my game.} dxe5 12. Nxe5 Bb7 13. Bf3 {Offering up a forced set of trades.} Bxf3 14. Qxf3 Qxf3 15. Nxf3 Nd7 {Black sees the knight coming to c5. d5 may have been an option here for white.} 16. O-O-O cxd4 17. Rxd4 {Note cxd4? Rc8! and white is in trouble.} Nc5 {Knight takes up its fine square but I get the open d-file.} 18. Kc2 f6 19. Rhd1 Kf7 20. Ne1 {Planing to trade Knight for knight.} Ke7 {Planing to trade rooks.} 21. Nd3 Nxd3 22. Rd1xd3 Rfd8 {To trade now would most likely be a mistake for white I wanted to try to get closer to the Queen side pawns.} 23. Kb3 a6 24. a4 Rab8 25. Kb4 e5 26. Rd4xd8 {Forcing the trade computer analysis gives white a slight edge I knew intuitively that this was good for white during the game.} Rxd8 27. Rxd8 Kxd8 28. c5 {Critical in whites endgame. } Kc7 29. cxb6+ {here I make my critical mistake the move was Kc4 getting ahead of the c4 pawn.  Though white is still not quite losing. It gives black a slight edge.} Kxb6 30. a5+ Kc6 31. c4 f5 32. Kc3 {? the idea being that black must abandon his kings position to queen.  Though White may already be lost with cxb6+??} Kc5 33. g3 {The final blunder as black gains the sharp upper hand seeing as e4 puts white out of commission now} e4 34. h3 g5 35. h4 gxh4 36. gxh4 h5 {White is pretty helpless as I'm reverting to testing blacks endgame skills.} 37. Kd2 f4 38. Kc3 {Give black what I thought was no good moves.} f3 39. Kd2 Kxc4 40. Ke3 {Fairly forced can you find blacks winning move? } Kd5 {And now white loses by force.  Kd2 Kd4 and e3 is coming. The f or h pawn will queen and its all over.}
