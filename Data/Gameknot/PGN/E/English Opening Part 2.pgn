1. c4 {English Opening.  I would be delighted to receive any comments or feedback on this game. I use the English a lot because sub-1700 players aren't very familiar with it.} f5 {This is an unusual counter.  The Game DB calls this the Anglo-Dutch defense.  Interestingly, this was the move with the highest average rating.} 2. Nc3 {I prefer 2.g3 in many ways but it can leave you just too weak in the centre against a determined counter-attack.} Nf6 {Mirror, mirror on the wall...} 3. g3 {Following the classical line} e5 {Black says "OK, if you don't want the centre then I'll have it!"} 4. Bg2 {Fiancetto} c6 {Doubtless with a view to d5.  The Game DB suggests that this move is a mistake, with White winning 66% of 56 games.  Presumably Black needs c6 for his knight.} 5. d3 {The DB is virtually screaming at me to play 5.d4.  Just so show my independence of spirit I stick with the classical formation - which happens to be the only losing move in the DB!} Bc5 {Piling pressure on the centre, yes, but not where the real action is.  I think 5...d5 would have been better.} 6. Nf3 {I want to castle to get my king out of the way} a5 {I can't really explain the thinking behind this move.  An advance to a4 is interdicted by the white N & Q.  Black already owns b4, which is covered by his bishop and unchallenged by White} 7. O-O {Castle} d6 {Now I'm really stumped.  I could understand d5 but d6 seems a bit half-hearted.  It does support e5 though. } 8. Na4 {One thing it does do is cut off his B retreat line.  So let's pull his jacket...} Ba7 {The only place he can go to avoid an exchange.} 9. Bd2 {Let's put a bit of pressure on his pawn.} h6 {This stops Ng5 but surely now is the time to develop some pieces?  Be3? 0-0?} 10. Qe1 {Now there's 2 attackers and only 1 defender for the blockaded a-pawn} b6 {That's supported the a-pawn but totally cut off the black B in the process} 11. a3 {Getting ready for an assault on the b-file} g5 {Wow. Black's 11th move is his 8th pawn move - each has moved once.  Black now has 4 pawns on the 5th rank and 4 pawns on the 6th rank.  On the face of it he appears to have a strong position.  White is cramped for room and Black owns the centre outright.} 12. b4 {The Empire Strikes Back.  After a patient build-up, White has at last decided to strike.} axb4 {Had Black declined the trade, I would probably have moved Rb1 to set up b5 and the possibility of an uncovered attack by my white B.} 13. axb4 {I could have taken with my bishop but I want to clear the a-file for my rook to put pressure on that marooned black bishop} Ng4 {This is an aggressive move by Black, trying to get some tempo back.  I think 12...e4 could have been better.  The white knight has nowhere to go except d4 which sets up 13...b5 and a double attack.  13.dxe4 fxe4 only delays this by 1 move.  So - right idea but wrong move by Black} 14. Qb1 {This supports an advance to b5 and also frees a space for the knight to retreat to e1} Na6 {Once again I'm half-baffled, half-delighted by this move.  b4 is defended by 2 pieces.  c5 is not available.  It does allow c6-c5 or Nc7 but surely Black could have found a better move than this?} 15. h3 {I need to drive that pesky knight back... [see 17 for the reason]} Nf6 16. Nxe5 {...so I can unleash my revealed attack.  The poor old knight sacrifices itself for a pawn.} dxe5 {Accepted} 17. Bxc6+ {Ah, but your sacrifice was not in vain! [the reason why 15.h3 was required can be seen: 15.Nxe5 Nxe5 16.Bxc6+ Nxc6 and I have sacrificed 2 pieces for 2 pawns - no thanks!]} Bd7 {Only move possible to avoid the outright loss of the rook} 18. Bxa8 Qxa8 {This leaves White 1 point up - a R & 2 pawns for a N & B.  Not a game-winning lead in itself but Black also has an isolated b-pawn for white to work on.} 19. b5 {I'm not done yet!} Nc5 {Offering an exchange, although it would leave White with a dangerous passed pawn on the b-file} 20. Nxb6 {No dice!  I launch another revealed attack.  If 20...Bxb6 21.Rxa8+} Qb7 {The Q still needs to protect the threatened B} 21. Nxd7 {I'm 2 pawns up and I don't have a white B left.  I'm also worried about the a8-h1 diagonal so I'm happy to exchange} Qxd7 {As we shall see, Nfxd7 would have been better} 22. Be3 {Keeping the pressure on.  Black can't move his N from c5 without losing his B on a7} Qb7 {I expect this was to free d7 for his other N} 23. b6 {Another non-intuitive move as b6 is defended by 2 pieces but supported by only 1.  } Qxb6 {Black doesn't really have any other choice.   23...bxb6 24.Bxc5 Bxc5 25.Qxb7 23...Bb8 24.Bxc5 } 24. Qxb6 {I'm happy to exchange while ahead..} Bxb6 25. Ra8+ {...and anyway Black now has to choose between losing a N or losing a R.  I don't see any way Black can trap the white R after 25...Kf7 26.Rxh8} Bd8 26. Bxc5 {And another piece bites the dust.  White is now up the exchange and 2 pawns besides} Nd7 {Black is also pinned down. he can't leave the B undefended, can't move it and O-O is prevented by white's B.  Black tries to drive the latter off.} 27. Bd6 {I'm happy to prevent O-O and Black's knight is blocking Kd7.  Also attacks the undefended e5} e4 {The threatened pawn advances} 28. c5 {I love the pawn-bishop support club. The B can't be attacked by a pawn and the passed c-pawn is a dagger to Black's heart} Kf7 {Black realises that he's never going to be allowed to castle} 29. Rfa1 {I was hoping for 29...Ke6 30.Rc8 then 31.Raa8} Ke6 {So far so good.  This combination will win me another bishop} 30. Rc8 {Get ready for the knock-out blow} Bf6 {Except that Black sees the danger and still has some fight left in him.  This dual attack (B on a1, R on c8) forces the exchange} 31. Rxh8 Bxh8 32. Ra5 {I am wary of Kd5 threatening Nxc5} Bd4 {Black is putting pressure on c5 but perhaps also hoping for 33.e3 which would allow Rc3 followed by exd3 and the possibility of queening a pawn} 33. dxe4 {I don't take the bait} fxe4 34. e3 {Driving the bishop off the powerful d4 square} Bc3 35. Ra7 {I had a few choices here:   1. Rb5 to protect the passed pawn; 2. Ra6 to try and set up a revealed check attack; but I chose 3. Ra7 This was to stop Kd5 by tying his King down on defensive duties, to force the movement of the dangerous knight from d7 and also to threaten Re7+ (which might be useful)} Nf6 {That relieves some pressure on c5 but I'm sure black will use that knight for mischief} 36. Kg2 {I need to get my King involved to break the deadlock. This allows f3} h5 {I would have thought that Nd5 was better} 37. f3 {f3 as advertised} Nd5 {Now black moves Nd5.  He obviously thinks that exf3 Kxf3 just gives my king a free move} 38. fxe4 {I don't see any point in trying to defend e3} Nxe3+ 39. Kf3 Nc4 {Threatening to take the bishop and win a pawn back} 40. Ra6 {Both a defensive move to protect d6 and setting up the revealed check } Bd4 {I thought this was a bit pointless at the time} 41. h4 {Let's get moving on the kingside.  If gxh4 gxh4 that leaves an iso h-pawn that my King should be able to pick off.  If g4 then Kf4 and my king's in the thick of the action and well able to threaten the blockaded pawns from behind} Nd2+ {A-ha!  Now I understand  40...Bd4.  That's a neat move to win a pawn} 42. Kg2 {White has a straight choice between Kg2 & Ke2.  I feel that the g- & h-pawn battle is what's important.  In retrospect, Ke2 was possibly better.  42.Ke2 Nxe4 43.Kd3  I had failed to spot that 43...Nxc5+ (a juicy looking fork) is prevented by Bxc5+.  43...Nxd6 doesn't do Black any real favours either} Nxe4 {Black claims his prize and now has 2 pieces attacking c5} 43. Bf4+ {I cash in my revealed check attack option to avoid losing another pawn outright} Kd5 {I think 43...Kf5 was better.  c5 is already under double attack and White has to move his bishop or lose it. } 44. hxg5 {I take with the pawn rather than the bishop.  The passed pawn should prove to be deadly and I can pick off h5 at my leisure. In retrospect, after 44.c6 I don't see any way Black could have stopped White from queening the c-pawn} Nxc5 45. Rh6 Nd3 {Black is running out of options...} 46. Rxh5 {Restoring the 4-point lead} Ke4 {Threatening to win a pawn (Nxf4 gxf4 Kxf4) and getting out of yet another pesky revealed check (g5-g6)} 47. g6 {The front g-pawn sets off on a dash for glory} Nxf4+ {Black wins a pawn but now can't stop the front white g-pawn without giving up one of his pieces.  The only place he can get his knight & bishop to combine is at g7.  So I think 47...Nc5 followed by 48...Ne6 would at least have delayed the inevitable a while} 48. gxf4 {The black knight is forking the white King & rook so has to be taken out} Bf6 {Perhaps too late black realises his mistake.  This fluffy move achieves nothing} 49. Rh7 {A pawn-for-bishop trade is now assured} Kxf4 {Black might as well take the pawn on offer} 50. g7 Bxg7 {Black's last piece swallows a bullet} 51. Rxg7 {So now it's just a straight-forward K & R mate; I won't bore you with any more commentary on that!} Ke4 52. Rf7 Ke5 {}
