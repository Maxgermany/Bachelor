1. e4 {This game remained fairly even throughout the match, despite both of us having chances to take the initiative. In the end it came down to endgame tactics, and I came out top.} e5 {I have experimented with the sicilian (1...c5) however much prefer to meet the pawn head on with this move} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. d3 Bg4 {Up to this point both sides have developed solidly, so it's difficult to say that anyone side stands better, perhaps black because white has one pinned piece but it's still no real advantage} 7. Na4 {Played to remove the well placed bishop, correct response is 7...Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Nd4 9. Qd1, putting the knight on a good square, and removing the knight on f3, which is a good defender of the king} Nd4 {A plausible move, but a slight mistake as I will point out in a couple of moves} 8. Nxc5 dxc5 {Now the mistake is apparent, although difficult to see... If white now continues 9. Bxf7  Kxf7? 10. Nxe5  Kf8 11. Nxg4, then white emerges 2 pawns ahead, and black has a very exposed king} 9. Be3 {Missing the opportunity, although not a terrible move, it develops another piece to a good position, and semi-pins the knight to the undefended pawn (semi because I can give check to avert the pin)} Nxf3+ 10. gxf3 Bh3 11. Re1 Nd7 {This move is made with 2 purposes, to defend the pawn on c5, and to release the queen into the kingside, with the potencial to make a devastating check along the g-file if the position allows it.} 12. f4 {A clever move, again with 2 objectives, making the g-file less available, and releasing the queen so she can defend the king if needed} Qf6 13. Qh5 {This move aims to trade off material, either with a queen exchange after 13...Qg6 , or trading bishops, as in the game. With such an open king, and the black queen and bishop lurking this is a good plan.} exf4 14. Qxh3 fxe3 15. fxe3 {I played for this exchange as in the position I felt I had the better attacking options, so wanted to keep queens on the board. The exchange has also opened up the white king further.} Qg5+ {I feel that 15...Qxb2 would be a mistake, as after something like; 16. Rab1 Qxc2 17. Rxb7 Qd2 (attacking the rook) 18. Reb1, then white looks to have the better position} 16. Kf2 Ne5 {This position looks very aggressive for black, although white has plenty of counterplay, however I couldn't see a knock out blow, so this move Ne5 aims to remove the bishop, and so doubles the pawns on the c and e-files, which should give me an advantage in the endgame } 17. Reg1 Qf6+ {Forced, in order to protect the g7 pawn} 18. Qf5 {Having decided to play for the endgame I accept this queen exchange, as I can capture the bishop after white takes my queen} Qxf5+ 19. exf5 Nxc4 20. dxc4 {In this position white looks better, as his king is more advanced, and he has 1 active rook, however I remain confident in my endgame abilities, and it shouldn't be too hard to at least force a draw. In rook endgames like this rook activity is essential, even being a pawn down can be made up for by well placed rooks} g6 {The only move, 20...Rg8 leads to 21. f6 which is rather awkward after 21...Kf8} 21. f6 {This pawn is over extended without backup, I want to mobilise my rooks, but must first get my king out of the way. This pawn gives me a target, and is a distraction to white, as he has to try and defend it} Kd7 22. Rad1+ {This seems good as it brings his other rook to a good square on an open file, however he needed to play something like Rg5 (attacking the c5 pawn), as my king is headed to the e6 square anyway} Ke6 23. Rgf1 {Again Rg5 is preferable} Rhd8 {This is the start of my dominance, I now have an active king, and have brought one inactive rook into the game} 24. Ke2 Rxd1 25. Kxd1 Rd8+ {Now the position is very much in my favour, white looks certain to lose the pawn, and with little compensation in position (his king is back on the 1st rank)} 26. Ke2 Ke5 27. Rf4 Rd6 28. h4 {A weak move, better would be to use his active rook with either Rg4 (threatening Rg5 ) or Rh4 (threatening the undefended pawn) although neither is particularly billiant} Rxf6 29. Rxf6 Kxf6 {With my kingside majority I was confident of forcing a victory, although I nearly messed it up!!} 30. Kf3 {Realising the danger on the kingside and so mobilising the king to cover} g5 31. Kg4 {If now gxh4 I could have won easily, after: 31...gxh4 32. Kxh4 Kf5 33. Kg3 Ke4 34. Kf2 h5. However I missed this opportunity} h6 32. c3 Ke5 {Oh dear I was calculating the variations after f5  Kh5 g4 Kxh6 g3 etc, and completely lost sight of the board} 33. hxg5 hxg5 34. Kxg5 {Even despite the blunder this should be a comfortable victory with my well placed king.} Ke4 35. b4 {I was anticipating Kf6, as this is the best move, although I noticed my opponent taking a while on this move (we were both online) so he perhaps calculated this line as a losing one (which I think it is) so wanted to try something different, however this is a bad blunder allowing me to stroll arround gobbleing up his pawns} Kxe3 36. b5 Kd3 {And my opponent decided to call it a day before it became too bloody. Even after a variation like 37. Kf6 Kxc4 38. Ke5 Kxc3 its easy to see my c-pawn will promote and win the game}
