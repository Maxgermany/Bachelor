1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. a3 {I do not know much of Queen's gambit, but I didn't understood this move.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bd6 5. e3 {Both are simply developing their peices.} O-O 6. Nf3 Re8 {This rook will help in moving the e pawn tio e5. Later or sooner the center is going to open, so this rook should help.} 7. Ne5 {A nice move. Taking it immediately would not help as I would be exchanging my active bishop for his knight and the pawn at e5 would be very powerful after white moves f4.} Nbd7 {An attempt to seige the center. The knight will either go back in which case I can break open the center with c5 or c6 then e5, or the f4 pawn will come ahead.} 8. f4 Ne4 {I am taking the space left behind by the white, and also f6 can come to push back the knight at e5} 9. Nxe4 dxe4 10. Be2 {White is trying to secure his king by castling.} Qh4+ {Trying to weaken the kingside to form an attack.} 11. g3 Qh3 12. Bf1 Qh6 13. Bg2 f6 {Here I sacrificed my pawn i nan attempt to seige the centerand activate my peices.} 14. Nxd7 {The sacrifice accepted.} Bxd7 15. Bxe4 e5 {The center is attacked.} 16. Bd5+ Kh8 17. fxe5 fxe5 18. O-O c6 19. Bg2 e4 {Though the pawn at e4 is isolated, but still it is very useful in trapping both bishops. It also creates a partition between the king and the queen side, in which case my bishops are very instrumental in forming an attack.} 20. Qc2 Qg6 21. Bd2 c5 {Trying to open the Queen side a bit to make my rooks active. Note that right now b5 would not be good as white can simply reply c5, completely lokcing the queen side} 22. dxc5 Bxc5 23. Rf4 Bc6 24. b4 Bd6 25. Rff1 Rac8 26. b5 {This was a blunder done.} Bxb5 27. Rfb1 {Now there was no way to protect the c pawn. So this tries to seige my a7,b7 pawns.} Bxc4 28. Qa4 {both of my queen side pawn will now fall apart} Be2 {right now there is only a white bishop to defend the king. Every other peice is far away in the Queen side. the wall at e4 and e3 pawn seperates the two parts very effectively.} 29. Rxb7 {taking up my pawns} Bf3 30. Rc1 Bxg3 {If white replies by 31 gxg3 Qxg3. There is then no way the mate can be prevented.} 31. Bxf3 {The only possibility} exf3 {Now there is no way mate can be prevented. After 32).... Bxh2  ; 33) Kf1 Qg2  ; 34)Ke1 Qe2  . So my opponent resigned}
