1. c4 {So, white starts off with the English Opening.} e6 {Still in book.} 2. Nc3 {White develops.} Qh4 {As usual, Joe is able to deviate from the guidelines and can get away with it, due to his strength.} 3. e3 {I don't know why white played this, but Joe will now sac his Queen for a Pawn.  When he does, white must be cautious because the weakest pawn is being removed, after which, his K is exposed.  Letting his guard will mean disaster.} Qxf2+ 4. Kxf2 h5 {Getting an open file for his Rook.} 5. Kg3 {I don't know why rrrrrrrrandom played this, but I view it as a blunder.  By playing this, his King is more exposed.  Instead, I would've continued my development with 5.Nf3} Bd6+ {Therefore, like we saw with my last annotation, Joe punishes white for failing to follow General Opening Guidelines.  That's because black has developed a piece to place black in check.  When white gets out, TA will use that time to get another piece into play.} 6. Kh3 Nf6 7. e4 {?? This, however, is where white goes wrong.  The idea was to fork black's Nf6, and Bd6.  So, like what we saw with reversion's chess puzzle, rrrrrrrrandom was hoping that Joe would overlook this threat which is why it's Hope Chess.  But, in doing so, white is going to wind up in worse shape.  } Ng4 {The reason being is that, at the very least, Joe will win back the Queen.  } 8. Qxg4 {While this appears to be better, even worse would be 8.Kh5 8...Be7+ 9.Kh3 (forced), Nf2+, and with the family fork, Joe would still win the Q.  But, white would not get a piece, in return.  However, I think and TA can both agree that the game is still lost for white.} hxg4+ 9. Kxg4 f5+ {Causing more damage by placing white in check, with a nasty pawn chain.} 10. Kg5 {My guess is that white wants to minimize the damage.  So, he retreated, as opposed to, taking on e4.  However, nothing is going to help white as the damage has been done.} fxe4 {So, Joe takes.} 11. Nxe4 {And, white takes back, whilst, threatening to exchange.  Against someone of his strength or lower, the plan might work.  But, it does not against someone like Joe.  As now, like that same puzzle, with which, I solved, black has a mate in 5.} Be7+ 12. Kg6 Rh6+ 13. Kxg7 Bf8+ 14. Kg8 Nc6 {As white, I would resign here because of...} 15. d3 Ne7# {This move.  The overall moral to this story is the same as that of reversion's blitz game.  That's because rrrrrrrrandom attempted to set up a trap, but against a more experienced player it doesn't work.  Instead, of trying to fork Knight and Bishop, had white followed General Opening Guidelines and had continued developing he would've lasted longer.}
