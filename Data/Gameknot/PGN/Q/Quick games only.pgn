1. c4 {Not sure about this move.  I think that e4 or d4 would have been better.} g6 {Preparing for the fianchetto.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. e3 {White should develop his pieces instead of moving pawns.  Now his bishop is blocked in.} Nf6 4. Bd3 c5 {Challenging white's center.} 5. Nf3 O-O 6. h3 d5 7. b3 dxc4 8. bxc4 Nc6 9. Bb2 {With all the attacking by black, white hasn't had a chance to castle.  This will be his undoing.  Black will keep the attack going and white won't know what hit him.} cxd4 10. Bxd4 e5 11. Bxe5 Nxe5 12. Nxe5 Nd7 {The e5 knight can't take the d7 knight because it is pinned to the a1 rook.} 13. f4 {This doesn't do anything to take the knight.} Nxe5 14. fxe5 Bxe5 15. Nd2 {Now the bishop is hanging.  The queen will move once in the game.} Qxd3 {This is the only time that the queen has and will move.  It's very rare to checkmate an opponent with only one queen move and I'm glad that I did it.} 16. Rb1 {White was trying to protect his rook, but that isn't the biggest threat...............} Bg3# {.............this is.  Checkmate.  I know that I didn't annotate this very well, but I just wanted to share my favorite win.}
