1. e4 e6 2. d4 a6 3. Nf3 b5 4. Be2 Bb7 5. O-O {I rushed to develop and in my rush I lost my e pawn.} Bxe4 6. Be3 Bb4 {Worth to note that my opponent had opted to developed bishops ahead of knights...} 7. c3 Ba5 8. Nbd2 Bb7 9. b4 Bb6 {black now achieved a powerful twin boom attack potential on the two diagonals directed at my king's castle. He is both tactical and a strategist, I believed.} 10. a4 c6 11. a5 Ba7 12. Ne4 c5 {? I think he had considered a few moves ahead and missed a short term weakness in his position.} 13. Nd6+ {Fork attack to gain a bishop and a pawn back. This is really a lucky break for me.} Ke7 14. Nxb7 Qc7 15. Nxc5 d6 {Black opted against losing both his swiftly developed bishops. Note that at this point, fifteen moves into the game, his horses were still in the stables.} 16. Nd3 Nc6 {Finally, the dark knight rises...} 17. Qd2 {to coordinate the cooperation of my rooks and the concentration of fire on g5 square or a possible kingside counter.} Nf6 18. Bf4 {positioning my dark (square) bishop to an important diagonal.} Nd5 19. Bg3 h6 {black defend the g5 spot!} 20. Rfc1 Qd7 {A neat little side step that disrupted my short term plans with my dark bishop and my rook on c file.} 21. Qb2 {The queen moves to provide more cover fire her two 4th rank pawns, both of which are subjected to pretty concentrated firepower from black's minor pieces.} g5 22. c4 bxc4 23. Rxc4 {breaking through the c file...} Rab8 {Black brings in heavy firepower onto the b file...?} 24. Rac1 {Full firepower on c file. The situation on the queenside front is intensifying, in stark contrast to the blockade and stalemate situation on the kingside.} Rhc8 {Black does not back down and shows hand. Here's a very aggressive and stubbornly strong opponent I have. This is the point I think I have to record this game regardless of whether I would win or lose it. It looked like an impending climatic meltdown, and we were both stuck to the prospect of a narrow channel of violent crossfire...} 25. Qa3 {I set my eyes on the d6 square... a seemingly defensive fort for the black king.} f5 {blacks puts pressure on the kingside and my dark bishop. Coral Boss was not blind to the threat and pressure on d6 from my dark bishop.} 26. Nc5 Qe8 {I was surprised that my knight scared off the black queen. Black did not yet wanted an attrition of pieces through minor pieces exchange. Or he was just too protective of his dark bishops. Pretty interesting theme of dark bishops. See, don't the dark bishops have a profound influence?} 27. Nxa6 {the a-file pawn is taken out... for I believe in the endgame benefits for my pawns if they do survive the baptism of fire to come...} Rb5 {Black advances his rook out of my knight's attack, and lends playability to my light (square) bishop for a discovered attack...} 28. Rc4xc6 {... and all these while, the prospect of launching the discovered attack and following up with a deadly pin...} Rxa5 {... had kept me distracted from the threat of a back rank assassination, Arya Stark style...} 29. bxa5 {... I've been lusting the d6 square for a while... and look how within reach it is now.} Rxc6 30. Bb5 {... a pin that I have plotted for a few moves. And alas, this is how chess humbles me...} Rxc1+ {how quickly had the b and c files opened up now my king had been threatened with a back rank mate...} 31. Qxc1 Qxb5 32. Nc7 {In retrospect, my knight escaping bought some time for my side.} Nxc7 {Black is willing to exchange minor pieces now. There are a number of reasons including the prospect of his e file pawn, double pawns, pawn majority on kingside overshadowing my dark bishop... I'll leave you the pleasure of considering them on your own.} 33. Qxc7+ {Avenging the knight and attacking the Black King! Check!} Qd7 {The black queen blocks my queen face to face for an exchange of queens. This is an interesting situation. Later in the day, after I have made my move, I shared a shot of this moment on the chessboard with my friend V, and he had swiftly and independently found the same reply...} 34. Bxd6+ {The king must run, since the black queen is locked in a face off with mine...} Ke8 {the only logical square to go.} 35. Qxd7+ {Queens cancel each other off...} Kxd7 36. Bc5 Bxc5 37. dxc5 Kc6 {?? An eager move that I myself might have made. } 38. a6 {I sometimes do enjoy the endgame a lot. A black king is theoretically stronger than two pawns, especially when the two pawns are not adjacent to each other... but now the black king cannot take my c pawn because that would give way to the safe promotion of my a pawn.} Kc7 {the black king takes a step back and my opponent resigns, as I would, from the grim prospect of fending my passed pawns while my Kingsguard knight slowly take on his estranged kingside pawns...}
