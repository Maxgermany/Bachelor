1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Nd7 4. d5 Ngf6 5. Nc3 c6 6. dxc6 bxc6 {Unusual line for white, black is fully defended.} 7. Bc4 Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. b3 Nb6 10. Qe2 Qc7 11. Rd1 Bb7 12. Bb2 Nfd7 13. Rd2 Nxc4 {The capture now gives black a valuable tempo, black will shore up e5 and then push for d5!} 14. Qxc4 Nb6 15. Qe2 f6 16. Nh4 g6 17. Rad1 f5 {More solid is 17...Rd1 followed by d5..., here black hopes to get a central pawn majority rolling while defending the kingside.} 18. g3 Rad8 19. exf5 gxf5 20. Qh5 Bc8 21. Qh6 {This move only looks dangerous...} Rf6 22. Qe3 Rf7 23. Nf3 Rg7 24. a4 Nd7 25. Ne2 Nf6 {Black is under pressure, wants to transfer the knight to the kingside to attack since white can play c4, but this plan opens Black up to a tactical shot...} 26. Nxe5 {An interesting tactical shot which Black did not expect. Is is sound? It sure looks bad for black, but we shall see...} dxe5 27. Bxe5 {The plan is to remove the defending queen. It looks like White's combo has worked, but...} Rxd2 {Necessary, and a surprise for White. If the rook recaptures, 28 ...Qb6 holds, since BxN is not met by BxB, but QxQ.} 28. Bxc7 {Takes the queen but this trades the queen and a couple pawns for two rooks and a piece, not promising. } Rxd1+ 29. Kg2 c5 {Black wants to open up the diagonal and keep the white N off d4} 30. Qf3 Ne4 {Keeps up the pressure.} 31. Ba5 Bd8 {Black tries to simplify to improve the rook's effectiveness.} 32. Nf4 {Hopes the discovered attack on the Rook will turn the game around, but...} Bb7 {The threat is 33 ... Nd6, and neither 33 Kh3? Ng5  or 33 Qe2 Nc3  work, so white grabs the rook.} 33. Qxd1 Nc3+ 34. Kg1 Nxd1 {Now b} 35. Bxd8 {Black has increased the advantage. } Rd7 36. Ba5 Be4 37. c3 Kf7 38. h4 Bc2 39. b4 cxb4 40. cxb4 Bxa4 {The probing for weaknesses has netted another pawn} 41. Ne2 Bb5 42. Nc1 Nc3 43. Nb3 Bc6 {Black is after the king} 44. Nc5 {Loses quickly, f4 was necessary, but there is no hope left.} Rd1+ 45. Kh2 Rh1# {A fitting end to a hard fought, tactical game.}
