1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 {This tournament game was a loss for me but I think its an interesting game.  The game has a surprise in store.} d6 {I went with d5-d6 which allows my b knight to access d7.} 8. Bg5 {White attacks my f knight with his DB to g5.} Nbd7 {I now develop my b knight to d7 which is now protecting my f knight.} 9. e4 {White takes further control of the centre with pawn to e4.} d5 {I attack the centre with d6 to e5.  This is protected by my LB at b7.} 10. e5 {As expected white pushes his pawn to e5 which further attacks my knight at f6.} a6 {I move pawn a7 to a6.  Not sure why I did not move my f6 knight maybe I should have.} 11. h3 {White was keeping the tension and did not take my knight but went with pawn to h3.  I presume this was to prevent my now moving my knight to g4 which would have been the square if I decided to move it.} Re8 {I decide to move my rook across to e8 I believe I was intending to move my knight to f8.  I also am aware that white's DB could move to h6 and I do not want my rook in the firing line.} 12. g4 {White is pushing on the g file now with pawn to g4.} Nf8 {I move my knight to f8 and I expect my opponent is aware I intend to move my knight to g6.} 13. exf6 {White now takes my f6 knight with his e5 pawn.} gxf6 {I capture with my pawn which may not have been the best move as I had my queen at d8 and if I had taken with my DB and white had captured this then I could have recaptured white's DB with my queen.  I may have not felt I wanted to exchange my DB at this point and I would normally try to keep my DB when I am black.} 14. Bh6 {As I thought white's DB moves to h6 and is now facing my knight at f8.  My king is now on an open file following my capture of white's pawn at f6.} Ng6 {I move my knight to g6 and I was planning to move up to h4 to inhibit white's pawns from any further advance.} 15. h4 {Of course white must have seen my thoughts and pushes h3 pawn to h4.} e5 {I maintain my knight at g6 as it is protected by the pawns and is a good position for present time.  So I push my e6 pawn to e5 attacking the centre again.} 16. dxe5 {White captures my e5 pawn with his d4 pawn.} f5 {I push one of my doubled pawns on the f file to f5 attacking the pawn at g4.} 17. gxf5 {White captures my f5 pawn with his g4 pawn and is now attacking my g6 knight.} Nxh4 {I capture the h4 pawn with my knight and white's f3 knight is in a position to recapture.} 18. Nxd5 {But White decides to capture my e5 pawn with his c3 knight and is now attacking my DB at e7.} Nxf5 {I capture a pawn in return with my knight taking the pawn at f5 and I am now threatening white's DB at h6.} 19. Bf4 {So white removes his DB from the attack by my knight and moves his DB to f4.  } Bc5 {I also do the same and move my DB out of white knight's clutches to c5.  I am now attacking the pawn at f2. } 20. Bg5 {Now white moves his DB to g5 attacking my queen at g8.  There is a passed pawn at e5 and this could be a risk if it continues to push down the e file.} Re6 {So I decide to push my rook to e6 to halt the progress of the pawn and I may have forgotten about my queen en prise.} 21. Bxd8 {White captures my queen at d8 but I do have the a8 rook to recapture the DB.  Now I am down a queen a piece not looking good.} Rxd8 {I recapture the DB with my rook but I have still lost my queen.  It doesn't look good for me but I must fight and try to make the best of it.} 22. Nf6+ {White now checks my king with d knight to f6.  My rook at d8 is vulnerable as the queen is opposite at d1.  This would be my next attack if I was white.} Kf8 {I move my king out of check to f8.  I could have taken the knight with my rook at e6 but this would have been retaken by the pawn at e5 I was trying to stop.} 23. Ng5 {I am surprised my opponent didn't capture my rook at d8 but instead he moved his f knight to g5 now attacking my rook at e6.} Rd4 {So I move my rook up to d4 and now protected by DB at e5 and my knight at f5.} 24. Qh5 {Now queen comes to h5 attacking pawns at h7 and f7.  I should have moved my rook down to e7 to protect my pawn at f7.  I could not protect my pawn at h7.} Ng7 {However I moved my knight to g7 attacking the queen.  But my opponent should not have reacted to this threat but should have continued to take the pawn at f7 and it would have been checkmate.} 25. Nxe6+ {It seems white did not see the checkmate.  White went with g knight to e6 checking my king.} Nxe6 {I proceeded to take this knight with my knight.  Phew my king survived but for how long.} 26. Nxh7+ {Now white captures my pawn at h7 and checks my king.} Ke8 {I remove my king to e8 and out of check.} 27. Nf6+ {White checks my king again with his knight move to f6.} Kd8 {I remove my king once again to d8.} 28. Qh8+ {Now white's queen comes into the attack with h8 and checks the king again.} Bf8 {I bring my DB to f8 protected by my knight at e6 and my king is safe again.} 29. Nh7 {Now black moves his knight to h7 and attacks my DB.} Rh4 {I move my rook across to h4 and pin the knight to the queen to stop the knight from capturing my DB.} 30. Qf6+ {White removes the queen from the pin and checks my king at f6.} Be7 {I defend with the DB to e7.} 31. Qxf7 {White captures my pawn at f7.} Rf4 {I attack the queen with my rook to f4 which is protected by my knight at e6.} 32. Qg6 {White moves the queen to g6.} Bc8 {I now move my LB from b7 to c8 and safe from white's LB at g2.  Now the LB is protecting the knight at e6 which is currently in the white queen's line of fire.} 33. Bh3 {However white has decided to also attack the knight and moves his LB to h3.} Nf8 {I think I am just in defensive mode and not really having any chance to attack the king. I move my knight to f8 and attack the queen protected by the DB at e7 and my rook on f4.} 34. Nxf8 {White captures my knight with his knight.} Rxf8 {I recapture the knight with my rook.} 35. Bxc8 {White captures my LB at e8.} Kxc8 {I capture the LB with the king.} 36. Rad1 {White moves his a rook over to d1 perhaps intending to double up the rooks.} Kb7 {I move my king away from the 8th rank to b7.} 37. Rd7 {White moves his rook to d7 attacking both the pawn at c7 and my DB at e7.} Bh4 {I remove my DB out of harms way to h4 attacking the pawn at f2 with 2nd attack from my rook at f8.} 38. e6 {Now white's pawn at e5 moves to e6 and we see the plan that white is fixed on.} Rf4 {I move my rook to f4 and towards white's king.  This may not have been the best move, better may have been moving a pawn to allow the king to escape, and while the rook was there white's rook could not access the 8th rank.} 39. e7 {White pushes his pawn to e7.} Rf3 {I push my rook to f3 which is not the best move by any means.  I could not risk taking the pawn as one of my pieces would have been taken leaving me with even less chances.  I should have given my king an escape route.} 40. e8=Q {White queens his pawn.} Rf6 {I now attack the queen at g6 protected by the DB at h4.} 41. Qge4+ {White moves the queen to e4 on the same file as the newly queened pawn.} Rc6 {I move my rook to c6 to protect the pawn at c7.} 42. Qa8+ {White sacrifices his queen with a move to a8.} Kxa8 {My king captures the queen.} 43. Qxc6+ {White's queen captures my rook at c6 and time is up for my king.  He is in check.} Ka7 44. Rxc7+ Kb8 45. Qb7# {White captures my c7 pawn with his rook I move out of check to b8.  With the queen to b7 its checkmate.  I appreciate it if white just allowed me to play the game through rather than checkmating me at 24.  I always had hope and I try never to throw the game away if I can help it. }
