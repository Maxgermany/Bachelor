1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Bg5 h6 5. Bxf6 Qxf6 6. e4 O-O 7. Nf3 d6 8. Bd3 Nc6 {Now I think that at the very least I can gain a tempo by attacking the underdefended d4.  I am not afraid of d5 because of Bxc3+. } 9. Bc2 {Once white played this move, I began to think about getting my bishop to g4 where at the very least I might be able to double the pawns on the kingside.  I was already thinking about maybe getting my knight to d4 adding to the attack on f3.  I thought that if things went exactly my way, I could have mating possibilities. } e5 10. d5 Nd4 {White can't capture the knight because exd4, a3 dxc3, axb4 cxb2 is strong for black. } 11. O-O {White needed to desperately prevent Bg4 by playing h3.  Now he is in big trouble. } Bg4 12. Kh1 Bxc3 {This is to prevent the knight on c3 from swinging to e2 and then g3 to protect the king. } 13. bxc3 Nxf3 14. h3 Qh4 {Most class A players would have no difficulty seeing this move. } 15. gxf3 Qxh3+ 16. Kg1 Bxf3 {Now white could resign, but he plays on a little bit. } 17. Qxf3 Qxf3 18. Rab1 {Doesn't help. } Qxc3 19. Bb3 f5 {I think here white should play f3 to give his king some breathing room. } 20. exf5 Rxf5 21. Rbc1 {What is the BEST MOVE for black? } Qf3 {This is much faster the move Qh3 that my students usually pick.   I also thought that Rg5+ would be slower, but after Rg5+, Kh2 Qf3, Rg1 (Be4 Qh5#) Rh5# } 22. Bd1 Rg5+ 23. Kh2 Qg2# {}
