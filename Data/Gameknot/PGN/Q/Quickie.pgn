[Opening "Bird (A02), From gambit, Lasker variation"]

1. f4 {i.e. how NOT to play the Bird opening. REally nothing too much to say about this game, just a trap I fell into just 7 moves in...} e5 {I'd never seen this response to the Bird opening before...} 2. fxe5 d6 {...nor this one but I never like to go pawn-hunting too early on - if you can't deal with the developmental advantage that your opponent gains you'll be in a lot of trouble! } 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. exd6 {!? Change of plan from me - it's not a bad move really but perhaps I ought to have stuck with my plan?} Bxd6 5. Nc3 g5 {Very strange move, I thought at the time. Checking the database on this one only a small handful of GK games reached this position. 6.g3 was played by all but one person...} 6. d3 {...who played this move. My logic was to retreat and play Nd2 should the pawn advance happen. Good plan?} g4 7. Nd2 {?? Definitely not! The problem was that I never like pushing my knight forward in most openings - it just seems too vulnerable! In a way it still is in this opening (7.Ng5 f5! wins the knight eventually though equality may still be reached - three pawns for the knight) and 7.Ng1 doesn't make White's position that pretty but as it turns out this one is suicidal!} Qh4+ {Yup!} 8. g3 Qxg3+ {Bxg3+ also works but this is prettier!} 9. hxg3 Bxg3# {Quick game, horrid mistake and mated in 9 moves. That's all folks!}
