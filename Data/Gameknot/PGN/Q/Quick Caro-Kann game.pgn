1. e4 c6 {Here playing white on a Caro-Kann game. It's a blitz game timed on 5min+15.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {Following the book but Nc3 is nice too.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 {Following the book again.} Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. h5 Bh7 8. Nf3 {It's now reach the position where most of the Caro-Kann games go.} e6 9. Bd3 Bxd3 {Exchange of the bishop.} 10. Qxd3 Nd7 11. Bf4 {I could have castled right now but I wanted to castle on the queen side.} Bb4+ {A logical continuation.} 12. c3 Ba5 {Nice positionned to attack my queen side later.} 13. O-O-O {Now I'm really well developped and ready to attack.} Ngf6 {Ne7 would have been better here. Black don't know what is coming.} 14. Bd6 {Blocking his castling so I can attack quickly later. My bishop is very nice stationned.} Bc7 {If black do Nb6. His bishop would have probably problems later with b4.} 15. Nf5 {!! If black take the bishop then Nxd6 giving me a nice positionning advantage. If black take my knight, then Re1+ and black must lose his queen or getting mated(exf5 17.Re1 Ne5 18.Rxe5 Kd7 19.Qxf5#).} g6 {Black picks another way.} 16. Ng7# {Mate! It's very rare I got the chance to play the Caro-Kann on blitz. I didn't believe it was possible to mate so early in the game with this opening. Well with the bishop hunt in the beginning, it give to white a lot of tempo and development.}
