[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 {The biggest mistake beginners make in chess to develope the queen to early. Normally when the queen comes out, the other player may develope for free by attacking it which results in a early offensive buried by a flood of enemy pieces. But in this case, it works and I´m going to try here to explain why. } e6 2. c4 c5 {Up till this point this has been a standard queen´s pawn opening, I think this variation is called the Keres Defense. Black however makes an early mistake here. White will not take this pawn, as it will obstruct black´s developement to no end. } 3. d5 e5 {This move is also bad. Black is utterly clogged. No knights are out. His f8 bishop is bottled up. Worse, his c8 bishop is in no position to do anything. In this situation, white can exploit the clog by Qa4 since black has no means to threaten it. } 4. Qa4 {Black is now in deep trouble. His white bishop is trapped. He has to get a piece out on the board other than a pawn. Perhaps Qf6 is the best option for black here since it forces white to play defense on the right side and at least slows down the pressure. } h6 {I have no idea why black did this. Bg5 would immediately be taken the queen. The threat is to black´s left side, not the right. } 5. Nc3 Be7 {Black latches unto a stratedgm here. Since he can´t get at the queen he´s going to get the king to opposite side of the board. Then he can finally move his d pawn and roll the queen back. } 6. f4 {Black needs to get the knight out and this slows that down. If he moves the knight, white takes pawn and the knight has to move again instead of being able to castle. } exf4 {So he takes it.. which is just as problematic. } 7. Bxf4 {Will black see Qb6? It´s not an optimal move, but it will at least take the pressure off. } Nf6 {Black is still committed to castling. Unfortunately BxF4 prevents that. Notice here that in 4 moves since the queen is out and black still hasn´t been able to threaten it. As an asside, in chess it pays to jettison fixed plans. Qb6 needed to happen. Castling looks tempting, but black needs to put pressure on white´s line. } 8. d6 {Oh dear. Qb6 no longer the move you want to make. Nb5 cuts it off, and the pawn prevent traps black´s queen. But there isn´t much by way of alternatives. Any move other than Qb6 and the bishop is toast. pull the bishop back and his castling plan is derailed. } Qb6 {Too late. } 9. Nb5 {The queen is pinned, the rook is forked. } Na6 {This is the right choice for black, but loses the bishop. White also doesn´t need that pawn, pawns deep in enemy territory need defending. This makes them liabilities more often than not. } 10. dxe7 d5 {Black still trying to get the bishop out. However this basically gives white an opportunity to pick up more material by realizing check. Black should have taken the pawn, which still gives him the power to bring the rook into play. And he can easily pull the king back to 8 file in case of check, which white could not have attempted anyway. } 11. Nc7+ {yup} Kxe7 12. Nxa8 {Yup. } Qe6 13. e3 {This is better than Nc7. White now needs to castle. This frees up the bishop and shields the pawn. Plus, black cannot stop Nc7 at his point anyway.   Note.. 13 moves in and black still hasn´t threatened white´s queen. } Nd7 {Black attempts to conserve the piece perhaps? } 14. Nf3 b6 15. Kf2 {No need to castle when the king can be useful defense. Nc7 requires the bishop to move, and the e pawn needs to be defended. } Bb7 {Too late!} 16. Nc7 Nxc7 17. Bxc7 a5 18. Bd3 Bc6 {On move 18 white´s queen is finally threatened. White's queen however is not serving a purpose though, from here on out the main action is going to be on the e file. Never put a queen in front of a king.    } 19. Qc2 g6 20. Rae1 {The rooks are lined up without needing to castle. If the king is well defended there is no reason why you can't advance him up a file to preserve tempo, especially when it helps defensively. } Re8 {King tries to get clear which not a bad plan but the tempo is not with black on this one. } 21. e4 {Obvious pawn push. } Nf6 {This is why the queen can be a liability, the worst situations I've found myself in are when people can take a piece and realize an attack on the queen. } 22. exd5 {queen } Ng4+ 23. Kg1 {Kg3 of course was the right move. Black puts together a good combination of moves here to convert this into an exchange instead of a slaughter. } Ne3 {Now its an exchange. } 24. dxe6 Nxc2 {The problem though is that when you are 8 points down, you are still losing even if it's an innovative piece exchange} 25. exf7+ Nxe1 26. fxe8=Q+ {Black resigned. Black put together a smart exchange at the end to prevent white from converting this into a route, but attrition still gets him in the end. (And he loses the knight after kxe8 anyway).   Moral of the story. Opening with the queen can be good, provided black cannot threaten it. In fact, a queen in an unreachable spot gives white a lot of good attacking options. Another good moral here is the importance of paying attention in the opening. Manage those pawns carefully, keep the files open to get the bishops or knights in a way that is helpful!   As always, I´d like to thank black for a fun game. }
