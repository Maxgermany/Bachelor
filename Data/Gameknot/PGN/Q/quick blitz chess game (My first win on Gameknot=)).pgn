1. e4 {e4 which is my favorite opening move...I prefer it more than d4 because I like playing fast tempo games.} e5 2. Nf3 {Developing my knight as usual...} Nc6 3. Bc4 {This is my favorite opening since I like to do the fried liver.} Nf6 {This is what I like the most when my opponent does not play bishop to c5 but instead knight to f6 which allows my knight to charge in for the fried liver.} 4. Ng5 {Fried liver time...} d5 5. exd5 {Pawn to b5 would be better for black} Nxd5 6. Nxf7 {Knight sacrafice for positional play... Likewise my username the divine knight} Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {This allows my queen to check and also attack the knight.} Ke8 {Many people would play king to e6 for black. But I would take the king to e8 move!} 8. Bxd5 Nd4 {Black blunders by this move...Black does not see the threat to the king with my bishop and queen.} 9. Qf7# {There's my first win on Gameknot=)}
