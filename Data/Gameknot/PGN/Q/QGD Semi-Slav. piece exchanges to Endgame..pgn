1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 e6 {Queen's Gambit Decline: Semi-Slav.} 5. c5 Be7 {Instead of Nbd7, I have in mind to play Ne4.} 6. Qd3 Nbd7 7. e4 {This is similar to the Marshal attack in the QGD semi-slav} dxe4 8. Nxe4 Nxe4 9. Qxe4 Nf6 10. Qc2 O-O 11. Be2 {?!} Qd5 12. O-O Qe4 13. Qxe4 Nxe4 14. Nd2 {?!} Nf6 {Planning to redirect my knight } 15. Nc4 Nd5 {ha! Now my knight is perched on top of the Tree; this is how I visualize this maneuver. } 16. Bd2 b6 17. b4 Ba6 {! Any Knight move and the Be2 gets its in the chin} 18. Rfe1 bxc5 {creating another open file.  This pays off too.} 19. bxc5 Rfb8 20. Rab1 Bd8 21. Na3 {?? This leads to minor piece exchanges that are better for Black and lead to a good position and a better endgame. } Rxb1 {!} 22. Nxb1 Bxe2 23. Rxe2 Rb8 {! With Tempo as White now has to respond to my attack, my plan, my piece. } 24. Re1 Bf6 {I had envision Bc7 but d4-pawn is hanging. } 25. Be3 Rb2 26. a3 Kf8 {The whole position is now what I would call "static" and every piece is in a good position so now it is time to improve your King location on the board. } 27. g3 Ke7 28. Rc1 {?} Nxe3 {!} 29. fxe3 Bg5 30. Re1 {?! } Bxe3+ 31. Rxe3 Rxb1+ 32. Kg2 Rd1 33. Re4 Rd3 34. a4 Ra3 35. d5 cxd5 {Even before White played Re4, I had seen that a-pawn was doomed and White can only defend by sac his d-Pawn, which would give me a 5 pawn vs 2 pawn majority in the endgame. } 36. Rb4 {To calculate that White cannot promote that pawn, and is a fool's dream, was part of my plan and he took the bait!!} a5 {Creating a Ram  Pawn power} 37. Rb7+ Kf6 38. c6 Rxa4 39. c7 Rc4 40. Ra7 a4 41. Rxa4 Rxc7 42. Kf3 Rc3+ 43. Kf4 {Rank fork!} Rc4+ 44. Rxc4 dxc4 45. Ke4 {This is the endgame.} e5 {The White King is blocked from the squares d3 & d4.  If Kd5 then the c-pawn runs to promote. } 46. h4 h5 47. Ke3 Kf5 48. Kd2 e4 {This is a pawn trick} 49. Ke3 c3 {Same idea. Squares d3 & d2 are blocking the King. } 50. Ke2 Kg4 51. Ke3 Kxg3 52. Ke2 f5 53. Kd1 Kf2 54. Kc2 e3 {}
