1. d4 {Here is a ladder game against a stronger opponent, which allowed me to bag my first class B draw. Here's how it unfolded...} Nf6 2. c4 {White tries to establish a strong pawn centre early on.} c5 {Black opts for a Benoni defense. } 3. d5 {I prefer this to Nf3, gaining more space. It doesn't seem to be over extending too much. } e6 4. Nc3 {A natural move. If there is to be a pawn exchange it may as well help my development.  } exd5 5. cxd5 {Nxd5 may be playable, but this way I should be able to maintain some space in the centre. } d6 6. e4 {Backing up the d pawn, and giving the light square bishop some options. } g6 7. f4 {Continuing to gain space. Looks like a good pawn centre that is hopefully not too easy to attack!} Bg7 8. Bb5+ {Developing with check. } Nfd7 9. a4 O-O 10. Nf3 {Continuing development and preparing to castle.} Na6 11. O-O {BxN may double black's pawns on the a file, but that doesn't seem to be enough compensation to lose the bishop pair in a game where white has all that space. In fact with all that space any exchanges would have to be carefully considered as they would probably favour black. } Nc7 12. Bd3 {Bc4 may have been ok, but the a2-g8 diagonal doesn't look like it will be opening up any time soon} Rb8 {Black looks to make his own space by preparing for b5. It would suit black if the queenside is opened up. } 13. Nd2 {repositioning closer to the action. } a6 14. Nc4 {I like white's position here - It seems flexible. The queenside seems safe, and white is only a couple of pawn moves away from a dominating presence on the kingside diagonals. } Qe7 15. e5 {Trying to squeeze black's position.} Ne8 16. Re1 dxe5 17. fxe5 {Now the kingside diagonals have opened up. Black looks to be cramped, but white will have trouble holding onto the central pawns, and black may yet get to stretch his legs. } b5 {I first thought this was a ploy to remove the knight from its defence of e5, but black already has the opportunity to take the e pawn. Perhaps trying to create counterplay on the queenside instead. } 18. axb5 axb5 19. Na5 {Looking at c6 to fork the black Q + R} Bxe5 {Black chooses counter attacking options instead of being concerned with exchanging a rook for a knight. } 20. Nc6 Qh4 {Threatening 21...Qxh2 } 21. Nxe5 Qd4+ 22. Be3 {This move was setting a trap. If 22...Qxe5, then 23 Bxc5 Attacks a rook with a bishop and discovers an attack on the queen with a rook. } Qxe5 23. Bxc5 {I had wondered if black may have seen the trap and decided it was worth exchanging an active bishop for an inactive rook. } Qxe1+ {But black had different ideas... I did look at this line, but dismissed it fairly quickly. After black played this it seemed quite playable. This way black takes off a rook, a bishop and a knight for the cost of his queen and a pawn. } 24. Qxe1 Nxc5 {White still looks good, but black now has a chance to try to create some counterplay and outclass a less experienced opponent. } 25. Qg3 {Making the queen more active. Bxb5 will still be there next turn. } Rb6 26. Bxb5 {See :)} Nd6 {Bringing the knight back and challenging White's bishop, also looking to make things complicated at e4. A knight exchange at e4 does seem perilous for White's bishop. } 27. b4 {White would prefer to keep his bishop, but would accept the exchange happily in this case to connect two passed pawns. } Nce4 {Forcing the knight exchange.} 28. Nxe4 Nxe4 29. Qd3 {Protecting the bishop and challenging the knight. } Bf5 {Both protecting the knight, and threatening a discovered attack on the queen. } 30. Ra6 {A move White would rather forget. } Nc5 {Black pounces on whites mistake. } 31. Qd4 {This way white can get some compensation. Black must now 31...Rxa6 but after 32. bxc5 White's passed pawns are connected. } Rxa6 32. bxc5 {Material is now equal, but black is going to need to pay plenty of attention to white's pawns. } Ra5 33. Bc6 {Stopping black from doubling his rooks (for now)...} Rb8 34. d6 {One step closer... Aware of the attacking opportunities for black down the queenside, but it seems to be repelled easy enough. I expected something like: 34. d6 Ra2, 35. Be4 Bxe4, 36. Qxe4  } Rb1+ 35. Kf2 Rb3 {Trying to squeeze Henry into the wall. } 36. Be4 {Protecting b1. If there's an exchange b1 will still be protected. } Ra2+ 37. Kf1 {Further restricting Henry. What happened to all that space White had earlier?!} Bxe4 38. Qxe4 {After the bishop exchange White can choose to force the draw by perpetual. } Ra1+ 39. Kf2 Ra2+ 40. Kf1 {Black seemed happy to settle for a draw here, } Ra1+ 41. Ke2 {But White still has some ideas.} Ra2+ 42. Kd1 Rbb2 43. Kc1 {I thought I had seen a way to exchange the White queen for a Black rook and an unstoppable pawn, but after reconsidering the pawn was stoppable after all 43. Qe8+ Kg7, 44. Qe5+ Kf8, 45. Qxb2 Rxb2 and I couldn't find a way to promotion.  } Rbf2 44. Qe8+ {Just in case black is caught unawares with 44. Qe8+ Kg7, 45. Qe5+ Kf8, 46. Qh8# } Kg7 45. Qe5+ Kg8 {Not this time!} 46. Qe8+ {The game ends in a draw. Thanks for reading, all comments welcome!}
