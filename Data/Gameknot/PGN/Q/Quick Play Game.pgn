1. e4 {This was the second of games with this time limit - it is the longest setting on the blitz section. I had won the previous one, on the white side of a Nimzo-Indian fairly comfortably. As she had annotated that one http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/real-time-game?gm=61234 I felt duty bound to annotate this one.} e5 {I opened e2-e4 to make a change. I had opened d2-d4 against her in our previous game. Maybe my first mistake?} 2. Nf3 {I stick with the main move. } Nc6 {So does she. It did cross my mind to deliberately lose this game, to my lovely opponent, to encourage her. Then I thought "well she would never respect me if she found out I deliberately lost", but as it happened, I lost anyway!} 3. Bb5 {So I play the Spanish, considered best.} a6 {And this is the most common reply.} 4. Ba4 {I retreat.} Nf6 {She hits e4.} 5. O-O {I castle.} Be7 {She plays the closed variation, as opposed to the open variation, starting with Nxe4.} 6. Re1 {So Protect e4.} b5 {She hits my bishop.} 7. Bb3 {I retreat.} O-O {She castles.} 8. c3 {I prepare d2-d4.} d5 {She plays the Marshall Attack https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruy_Lopez#Marshall_Attack} 9. exd5 {It would be ungallant to refuse a pawn from such a charming lady.} Nxd5 {She takes back.} 10. Nxe5 {I take again.} Nxe5 {She takes back.} 11. Rxe5 {So I take.} c6 {She protects Nd5} 12. d3 {The modern way. d2-d4 used to be played here.} Bd6 {She hits the rook.} 13. Re1 {Rook retreats.} Bf5 {She develops. } 14. Qf3 {My queen comes out.} Qf6 {So does hers.} 15. Nd2 {I develop my knight.} Qg6 {She attacks my pawn on d3. Funnily enough I looked at Bf5-g4 and thought, what of it? My queen can always go to e4. Then I go and play.} 16. Ne4 {This of course is motivated by a desire to save my d pawn. She already could have played Bf5-g4.} Rae8 {But she plays this instead. I should have saved my queen with h2-h3, but instead I make another huge error.} 17. Bd2 {I played this, thinking I was now threatening Ne4-d6, now that my rooks were connected.} Bg4 {Ouch! I learn that she is not just a pretty face! I have to give up my queen for two bishops - but I still have fighting chances, as I have an extra pawn too!} 18. Qxg4 {So I take.} Qxg4 {She takes back.} 19. Nxd6 {I take the other bishop.} Rxe1+ {She swaps rooks.} 20. Rxe1 {I take back.} Qg6 {Queen returns to g6, forking d6 and d3} 21. Ne4 {The only way to save both.} Nf6 {Offering a knight exchange.} 22. f3 {I protect my knight.} Nxe4 {She exchanges - giving me a strong centre.} 23. fxe4 {This recapture also gives me play on the f file.} c5 {She prevents me from playing d3-d4 with a dominating centre.} 24. Bd5 {I love this square for the bishop. I rather thought I was getting back into the game here. However around here the phone went. It was a chess playing friend, who is hard to get hold of. We had a lot to talk about, and I foolishly tried to play and chat at the same time.} Re8 {She develops her rook.} 25. Rf1 {I hit f7.} Re7 {She protects.} 26. Be3 {So I hit the c pawn.} Rc7 {She protects again.} 27. Bf4 {So I hit the rook again.} Re7 {Rook moves. Now surely best is Be3 and black has to somehow figure out how to stop the repetition. But, as I said, I was foolishly trying to conduct a telephone conversation at the same time, and I made a terrible mistake.} 28. Bd6 {Thinking I was attacking the rook again. As soon as I made it, I realised my mistake.} Qxd6 {It is now hopeless. I resigned. Many thanks for reading, please rate this annotation, and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing! Until next time, dear reader!}
