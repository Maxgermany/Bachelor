[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {A Petrosian patent. Most if not all of Petrosians chess games as white are opened with either d4 or c4. However, just for the beginners out there it is important to note that neither e4, d4 nor c4 (and Nf3 and g3) are all equal openings with neither one being more effective than the other. It is only a matter of preference.} d5 {Korchnoi responds with d5 which is slightly odd for his style of play as most of the time (86% of the time in fact) Korchnoi replies to 1.d4 with Nf6 and either a Gruenfeld or an Indian. So with d5 Korchnoi might have something prepared...   On 1...d5 Black is simply mimicking white's move. This can lead to the many variations in the Queens Gambit Declined such as the Slav, Tarrasch, Semi-Tarrasch Defence as well as the Torre Attack and other uncommon opening variations. It is a perfectly logical and playable move.} 2. Nf3 {Less common then c4 but perfectly playable.} Nf6 {Once again mimicking whites move. White now has two main choices c4 which leads to the QGD or Bg5 which may become a Torre Attack depending on other moves played.} 3. c4 e6 {Accepting the 'gambit' pawn is playable but white can easily win back the pawn. (4.Qa4  or 4.e3 b5 5.a4 c6 6.axb cxb 7. b3!)} 4. Nc3 {We have now reached the main line of the Queens gambit declined which is usually reached after the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 (Although 4.Bg5 is more common.) Now after 4...Be7 and 5.Bg5 play continues as normal but with blacks next move he introduces the Tarrasch Defence.} c5 {Here we are at the Tarrasch Defence.   Usually in the QGD blacks main goals are e5 or c5. Here with the Tarrasch Defence black achieves this goal early however, it can lead to a slight strategic advantage to white.} 5. cxd5 {By far the best and most common move. If 5...exd then the Tarrasch Defence is introduced or if 5...Nxd5 then the Semi-Tarrasch is introduced.  With the Tarrasch Defence black accepts an isolated d pawn for smooth development and plenty of space. Many GM's have played the Tarrasch Defence now and again including former World Champion Garry Kasparov until Karpov with the white pieces outplayed him in the World Championship match. In this defence white plays against black's isolated pawn while black tries to use his piece mobility to lauch an attack.  Unlike it's cousin, the Semi-Tarrasch Defence does not give black an islolated d-pawn but instead allows white to build a strong center. (See game)} Nxd5 {After a slightly uncommon move order we reach the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. As said before white obtains an advantage after the following moves.} 6. e4 {Logical and in my opinion the best move. Black is voluntarily allowing his knight to be driven around the board there is no reason why white should not do just that.} Nxc3 {The only correct move as it gains tempi and trades off pieces to lessen a future attack. However the disadvantages are obvious as white's b pawn has now been converted to a c pawn increasing white's centeral majority.} 7. bxc3 cxd4 {A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and Bb4  accomplish.} 8. cxd4 Bb4+ {As mentioned this is played to trade off the minor pieces however after the trade black will be left with a very passive white bishop compared to white's active bishop. Therefore other ways of reaching equality have been tried such as Nc6 9. Bc4 b5! as played by Fischer against Spassky as Bxb5 loses to Qa5 .} 9. Bd2 Bxd2+ 10. Qxd2 {Although black has suceeded in exchanging two sets of minor pieces white doesn't really mind as his two minor pieces are very well placed.} O-O {Now that the position has simplified we can analyse the position. There are only two sets of minor pieces on the board but white's bishop can come into play actively unlike black's white bishop while white's knight is also actively placed. White also has a large centeral majority and although the king looks awkward in the center its is perfectly safe.   Because of his small centeral majority, black's chances are on the queenside with his 2-1 pawn majority on the left wing. However, it will only be towards the endgame when black can exploit this and he must be content with developing and defending himself for now.   White on the other hand is looking for the d5 advance to create a passed pawn and even if it is not queened it will draw blacks forces away from his king where upon white will lauch an attack.} 11. Bc4 {The best spot for the bishop as it helps the d5 advance. Furthermore, Bd3 and Be2 block the e and d files which white will want to place his rooks on.} Nc6 {At first sight this is a simply logical move as it develops the knight to the 'best' square. However, if white can get the d5 advance in black will be forced to lose time moving his knight a second time. Therefore there is alot to be said about Nd7. So, blacks move is completely in contrary with what is required and there is nothing wrong however it should be noted that Nd7 should also be considered as a possible move.} 12. O-O {White needs his rooks on the open files to break through. Also after the coming d5 exd exd the e-file will be open and white's king could be vulnerable.} b6 {Blacks best move. He prepares the fianchetto which will activate his trapped bishop.} 13. Rfe1 {Whites rooks mobolise as quickly as possible. Another possible move is Rfd1 when the a-rook goes to c1 however the prospects for the e-file opening are very good. Furthermore, white needs a protector of e4 as after Bb7 black might have nasty discoveries on the unprotected pawn.} Bb7 {Logical follow up.} 14. Rad1 {White has now completed his objective and has mobilised his rooks and is ready to play d5. } Ne7 {With this move black anticipates the coming d5 advance and although it is too late to stop the pawn, after d5 exd exd black has Nf5 and Nd6 to blockade the pawn.} 15. d5 {! With all white's forces ready he breaks through. Now he must watch for the Nd6 blockading maneuvre as mentioned previously.} exd5 {It is necessary to exchange pawns to free the f5 square. } 16. exd5 {White has now obtained what he wants, a passed pawn but he must now work on trying to queen the pawn.} Nf5 {With the idea of Nd6 blockading the pawn but Petrosian has an excellent move.} 17. Ne5 {! This is in my opinion an excellent move because it prepares to bring the knight to c6 where it will either cause much annoyance for black if he leaves it there or he will have to exchange it for his white bishop turning the passed d pawn into a passed c pawn meaning the blockading move Nd6 is useless.} Nd6 {So black blocks the passed pawn but with the Nc6! move coming he brings a little trouble about himself.} 18. Nc6 {! Now black has 3 choices 1. trade the bishop for the knight (See game) 2. Attempt to ignore the knight by Qf6 after which white will protect the bishop and black will have to endure a awful middle game due to the well placed knight. 3. An attempt to win a piece with 18...Nxc4 when after 19.Nxd8 Nxd2 20.Nxb7 Rab8 21.Na5!! bxa5 Rxd2 he is left with 2 doubled A pawns which have no chance of becoming passed while white still has the passed d pawn.} Bxc6 {? From all the alternatives mentioned, this is the worst continuation although it temporarily wins a piece black has no way to block the future passed c pawn and with less pieces on the board white's passed pawn is increasing in power and this ultimately leads to blacks downfall.} 19. dxc6 {So now white's passed pawn has turned from d - c meaning the Nd6 is completely pointless therefore black exchanges it for white's bishop.} Nxc4 20. Qf4 {! Winning back the piece as there is a discovered attack on the queen. Wrong is Qxd8? when Raxd8 21. Rxd8 Rxd8 22.c7 loses to Rf8! (eg 23. Rd1 b5! 24.Rd8 Nb6!.) So black must now give back the piece.} Nd6 21. Rxd6 {! White keeps the queens on the board (instead of Qxd6) which allows him to attack on the K-side while blacks pieces are tied down to defending the passed c-pawn. This move also gains a tempi which will help white.} Qc7 {With the sensible and logical idea of blockading the pawn.} 22. g3 {Petrosian realises that black has no winning prospects and cannot do anything as his  pawn majority on the left wing is of no value in comparison to white's passed pawn. Therefore he takes his time, firstly by giving his king some 'luft' so that the Re1 is free to maneuvre if necessary.} h6 {Black wants to give his king some luft to prevent back rank mates as there could be many threats to the back rank to come. However, perhaps such a weakening of the kings position mightnt be necessary at this point in time as white has no direct threats against the back rank.} 23. Qe5 {! With this move (and the next) White demonstrates his complete superiority over black as he can take his time to maneuvre since black cannot do anything productive. Rae8 loses to 24.Qxe8! Rxe8 25. Rxe8 Kh7 26.Red8 since the passed pawn is too strong.} Rac8 {With nothing to do, black hopes to at least prevent white from queening the pawn with all his forces. However, this allows white to launch an attack. } 24. Qd5 {! Petrosian protects his pawn again while centeralising his queen to the best square possible. White is completely dominating and the only thing which remains to be given a useful job is the rook.} Kh7 {Black is simply bidding his time however I think this is a psycological surrender as Petrosian with his next move realises blacks 'surrender' and plans an attack.} 25. Re4 {Instead of the Rd7 which can be played anytime, Petrosian plans the attack. Now his rook can come to f4, g4, and h4.} Kg8 {Bidding time.} 26. Kg2 {! With black's forces distracted by the passed pawn white advances his king as well as the g pawn which will be used to break into black's king. This move becomes more apparent after black's 31st move as it also prevents any checks on the back rank.} a6 {Preparing b5 to give some hopeful counterplay but right now black is quite lost.} 27. h4 {Black can do nothing against this slow but steady advance of the pawns.} b5 28. g4 {White is now preparing the g5 break. Just watch how Petrosian calmly maneuvers his pieces.} Kh7 29. Re2 {! A very flexible move. The reason behind this move is that when white plays g5 black might block the position with h5 and g6 when the hole on f6 will become a weakness. Re2 allows the queen to come to f3 so that if the h5 g6 maneuvre is played, the queen can exploit the hole on f6. Furthermore, the rook is better positioned here as it can come to the c-file or d-file if necessary where as on e4 it cannot come to c4. It sometimes seems unecessary to do this move and if black had certain threats/counterplay it probably would be a waste of a move. However black do anything productive so white can afford to take his time.} Kh8 {Black is still bidding his time...} 30. g5 {!! Finally the g5 break. If hxg hxg black will lose quickly due to the open h-file.} h5 {Blacks best move. He blocks the position around the king but as mentioned, when the queen comes to f3 he will have a hole on f6.} 31. Rd2 {White protects the rook so enabling his queen to come to f3. He doesn't mind giving up the e-file as it is of no use to him.} Rfe8 {Black takes control of the e-file but this comes too late. Only now can one appreciate the importance of the 26.Kg2! move as if it were on g1 black would have drawing chances with Re1  and Rc1.} 32. Qf3 {White finally achieves his goal. Although there is no weakness on the f6 square yet, blacks next move is forced to protect the h pawn.} g6 {The only move to protect the h-pawn but now the f6 square will be a permanant weakness.} 33. Rd2d5 Ref8 {Black's f pawn is also a weakness and since the rook is doing nothing useful on the e-file he bolsters the pawn. } 34. Rf6 {! Making full use of the weakness and applying more pressure to the f-pawn. Furthermore he threatens the decisive Rd7!} Qe7 {A final mistake. The point of this move was so that after Rd7 Qe8 the queen protects the f-pawn however, Korchnoi under time pressure misses the following combination.} 35. Rd7 Qe8 36. Rxg6 {!! A very pretty move as fxg allows Qc3  followed by mate.} Qe5 {?? Blunder due to time pressure but black was lost anyways.} 37. Qxh5# {An extremely complex game showing some ideas in the Semi-Tarrasch Defence, the importance of recognising a completely dominating position and taking your time to unleash the killer blow as well as how to set goals (such as the penetration of the weak f6 square) and work towards them.}
