[Opening "Queen's pawn, Mason variation (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 {Standard, for me. } e6 {Traps his own bishop. Not necesarily bad, but it does allow me to manouver on the kingside. In my scheme, I already know that 85% of the games will be under the flag "white attacks the kingside". This move kind of favour me. I can tell these things so early in the game by experience - hundreds of games. Normally, it is too soon to make these assumptions. } 3. Nf3 Bd6 {Now, this is the move that disrupts my plans. Normally, people plays it later, "once the N is in f6 (the fisrt key) and my pawn is on d3 (second key)". So I can go Ne5, and it cannot be kicked by f6 very quickly. And Nh5 cannot be played because the Q is aiming at it. But now, I know that after Ne5, f6, then I cannot go Qh5 (because I didn't play d3 yet), so I must retire in d3, and after BxB, NxB, my knight is displaced, and black will have an edge. By experience. So I decided to try something more. } 4. Qc1 {Ugly. But it's a blitz. Let's see what happens. } Bxf4 5. Qxf4 {Ok, now the story is different. I have a queen and a knight on the kingside. I have to prove that these two pieces are deadly, to force black to find a better move than BxB (probably a better move). } Nf6 {I expected g5, kicking the queen, but black is too wise and he knows that it will be difficult for him to castle queenside, so he has to guard his kinside castling. } 6. Qg5 {So let's threat it. This is a kind of "unnatural" move (the natural one would have been a developement move, like d3, or Nd2/Nc3). So before you try it in an actual game, think more than twice. } O-O {Black castles just in front of my queen. But my pieces are still undeveloped, and my knight in e5 does nothing for the attack. I better spend my move wisely. } 7. Nbd2 {Better than d3 because I don't want to allow black to threat a Queen's trap. If you are experienced, you will already have smelled the danger of having the queen out of squares. But it was too late. } Nbd7 {Better than Nc6, normally, because now black can go c5 - always the move he has to  go after, in this opening - but now black could have gone for the queen trap and play Nc6 threatening something starting with h6 and ending with e5, with the white bishop threatening the white queen once retired on a white square. } 8. e3 {Well, since black doesn't seem to play for it, let's use the tempo for my very necessary developement. Note tha, in doing that, I am closing another possible square for my qeen: I am basically trapping it myself. Be aware...} c5 {Black doesn't seek my queen. Good. } 9. c3 {Let's pretend my queen isn't trapped, and go on for a while. But this was a mistake. I won't take the pawn because after the N retakes, is in a very good position. Then black will be able to play c4, preventing the bishop on f1 from the diagonal aiming at the black king. So, I SHOULD have moved Bd3, even if black would have gone cxd4. (So what? I would have retaken with d3xd4, and my queen would have been almost free, so...) But if the bishop is in d3, after c4 it goes to c2, and from there he aims at the enemy's king, helping the queen to attack. So why to waste time with this useless c3?} c4 {Deserved. Now my lsb cannot enter into the fry. It must go to e2, doing nothing, and from there wait for the knight to jump to act as g4 and h5's guardian - nothing more. } 10. h4 {So I, desperately, tried another way to attack: by force. Wiht the help of my h1 rook (h3-g3). Rude and inelegant, and probably my queen will be trapped in the process, but I have nothing funnier to to. Qg3 - Qd6 could have been an escape for my queen, exchanging it... but is this "fun"? :-)} Ne4 {I can exchange the knigt, here, after which a lot of exchanged can be possible, and, again... it is not fun!} 11. Qg4 {Let's see what's happens. White takes advange of the blocked black's lsb to find a place. It is very bad, since after Nd7-f6,u Q must move again and black has plenty of pieces around his king. } Nxd2 {But black helps me a little. } 12. Kxd2 {...not with the knight, because I want to keep the pieces as active as possible. No problem for my king to stay in the middle of the board. Black can attack with Qb6, and I wil defend with Kc3. Not unbareable, but more dangerous if you think about black playing e5, and then opening the way to his lsb to occupy f5. } f5 {Trap the queen's mission starts, at last. I think in the wrong way, let's see. } 13. Qh5 {If g6, Qh6 or Qg5 will do (but a very good player will be beyond that and see if the position was playable), and if 13... Nf6, 14. Qg5, h6, 15. Qg6, Qe8 (?), 16. Qg3 and black loses his possible countergame based on Qb6. } Qf6 {Sensible, too. } 14. Ng5 {Don't do this at home. I was just trying to scare my opponen, but there is nothing solid in this attack - again, because of me trapped lsb. Or I had to go on with my original plan of Rh3. Remember: never switch plan :-(} Qg6 {Well, this apparently gives me the e6 pawn. And the question is: will be able this knight to escape and get back to join his army, or will it be trapped, too? You learn to ask you such things after several piece losses. } 15. Qxg6 hxg6 16. Nxe6 {Apparently, my knight is safe because it can go back to g5, or to c6 and then b5. } Rf6 {Nc7, Ra8-b8, Nxd4. } 17. Nf4 {I didn't see it. :-(} Nf8 {Black could have defended with Rd6. } 18. Nxd5 {This is so ugly that you can resign. Losing its central pawn's chain leaves black with no game, but loose pieces. } Rd6 {Too late. The easy way is Ne7+, followed by NxB. But then after RxN, I cannot take the c4 pawn with the bishop because it will be covered by the rook. So I went for...} 19. Bxc4 {Wonderful, right? No. I lose a piece here. Can you see why, and how to avoid it?} Be6 {Ok, now tell me how do I avoid BxN. If Nf7, BxB, 21. NxRa8, Rf6 and my knigt is lost. So...} 20. Ne7+ Kf7 {Very smart. And now I lose  a piece by force. Did you see it coming?} 21. d5 {I didn't realize I had my pawn pinned to my king. When I did, I was unable to find a better plan, so I played it anyway, just to make my opponent think more. } Kxe7 22. e4 {By opening the e file, I pretended to get some counterplay based on the rooks. } fxe4 23. Rhe1 Bxd5 {Yes, of couse. Now, if BxB, RxB is check, and I cannot take e4 anymore. } 24. Bxd5 Rxd5+ 25. Kc2 {No use Ke3 since d3 is black's. } Re5 {Now Huston, we have a problem. A piece down for a pawn. Now, I can grab the e4 pawn with f3. I didn't see it. } 26. Re3 Rd8 27. Rae1 {Let's say that, being down in material, I didn't want to exchange rooks. } Kf6 {Now black can defend the pawn with the other rook. I can get the pawn, but, I wanted to be "nastier". } 28. f3 {I'll get the pawn without exchanging the rook, or so I thought. } Rd3 {Of course. } 29. f4 {I tried to play "surprises" the most I could, but this was just bad. If I get to play g4, I have buildt a barrier for the black king. but please, don't take this as a lesson about how to proceed in this position. } Red5 {Of course the black penetration would be a problem (Rxg2 being the last of them: the king is near a mate net). Fortunately, the black extra knight is almost unexistent, to the moment. } 30. Re1e2 {If I would have been coherent about not exchaging rooks, R3-d2 was the right move. } Ne6 {Oh, the knight "awakes"... Black should have exchanged rooks, but for some reason he doesn't want to. He wants to keep the threat of hunting my king through the first rows, maybe. Here comes the "priority" problem that gives the annotation its name. } 31. Re3xe4 {Of course, since now I defend the f4 pawn. } Nc5 {Now, I have to choose my priority. To defend the queenside, or try to take advantage of the weaker black pawn's structure? The black pawns are harder to defend than mine. } 32. Re4e8 {I choosed the attack way, of course... the idea is Rf8#!} Nd7 {Defending it by keeping the knight far from my king. Good. } 33. Re2e6+ {This way, the black king can escape, but it gets far from his doubled pawns. } Kf5 34. g4+ {Offering two pawns to the black king. I will have lost one anyway.} Kxf4 35. Rxg6 {Now another black pawn is threatened. Of course, it has ha price: black will hunt my king. Will his attack be a winning one? Hard to say now, but a good chess player would have known it exactly before choosing to allow black to do it. } Rd3d2+ 36. Kb3 {The king could have gone to c1. If black wants to go Rd1+, Kc2, R5-d7+ he can play then Rg2, hunting my pawns, then align the rooks on the second row, and take b2... I'm just lost. But your opponent has to see it, and choose this plan. He has another, and I invited him to go on hunting the king. A risky plan (it was a blitz...)} Rb5+ {B2 is lost. Will I have enough countergame on the kingside?} 37. Ka3 Rdxb2 {Can you see that after Rb1, mate is threatened?} 38. Rxg7 {I can't defend. I have to attack, and hope for black doesn't find a way to mate too soon. On the other side, black king's position is not any good, either. } Ne5 {Threats mate with Nc4+, Ka4, Ra5#. On the other side, black can't play Nxg4 because he will lose it after Rf8+, Kg3, Rf-g8, because the other rook cannot support it the next move. } 39. Rf8+ Kg3 40. Rc8 {Necessary to avoid the mate.} a6 {Black didn't see Rb1. Probably, he plans to play it the next move, without fearing Ka4, threatening the rook. } 41. h5 {Incredible but true, I have a tempo to advance my pawn. } Rb2b1 {Ah, he did it, at last. } 42. Ka4 {Ok, now if Ra1, a3. My king is trapped in a cage, but fortunately the knight is not in a position to mate. Black should play then the 1 rook to e, and threat mate with Re4. I couldn't have used the c pawn to shield because of N takes it, but I could have used the c rook to go to d4. After the exchange, the black knight could mate but taking some moves to get to c3, and I would have had time to react. I don't know if black had seen that far (nor if my view is accurate!), but he choosed another path. the wrong one, as you'll see. } Nxg4 {Fatal, but is hard to see it. I can go Rc-g8, winning the knight as I commented before. But even better it is...} 43. h6 {It just crushes black (he will have to lose a rook for that pawn). } Rh5 {White's priority has switched from threatening me mate, or trying to avoid my queening. } 44. h7 {Goodbye rook!} Kh4 {Hopeless and bad, but understandable. Black is suddenly losing the game, with my king  trapped and a knight more. But with analysis, black should have preferred Kh3. Can you see why?} 45. h8=Q {...because now black cannot play RxQ for RxQ (Nh6, QxN#)!} b5+ {The last try by black, but too late. } 46. Ka5 b4+ {Kxa6 is a solution. Ra1, and I can just move the queen to g8 and goodbye. } 47. Qxh5+ {But this was more spectacular. Not better. } Kxh5 {Forced. Now, Rh8, Nh6 (forced), and I have to follow with Rg-h8. Black loses the knight, but hey, he has a b4 pawn that can take c3 and threaten to queen. My rook check I will have anyway. Kxa6 is just a tempo loss: a6 is mine almost whatever happens (Kxa6, Ra1, and I lose the a pawn, and b4 has a free way to b3).} 48. cxb4 {So this was the profilactic move. Now black has to cope with an ugly position, and it is just question of time to lose. Note we are at move 48, and not less than 20 more are needed to win. But it was an enjoyable game, full with surprises, mistakes and tactics. It is interesting to observe that the black knight is just lost because of the black king's position. He should have played the rook to the e file to get it to the 6th row as the only mean to defend. } Ne5 {Unfortunately, black leaves control of h6, and loses at once. } 49. Rh8# {A lot of tension and, probably, frustration by black, that loses after have being well ahead. It is always a good excercise to try to get the most from your pieces, even if you are down. In this case, it was indeed possible. Thank you for reading, and I hope I didn't say too many wrong things about this game. I wish I could have more time to review it, but life's calling :-)}
