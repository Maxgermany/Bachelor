1. e4 {King's pawn opening and Sicilian Defense.  All constructive comments are welcome and encouraged.  I am always looking for ways to improve my game.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Bd7 6. Nc3 Nf6 7. Bg5 e6 8. Qd3 Be7 {At this point white's pieces are fully developed, and even though black only has to develop his queen, his pieces appear cramped.} 9. O-O-O {Castling long to both maintain the tension on black's pieces as well as connecting the rooks.  White also has queen and rook on the same file with this move.} a6 {Challenging white's bishop since black's pieces don't have much to do...} 10. Bxc6 {Black made a push with the a-pawn before considering king safety and white presses to explode open the tension...} Bxc6 11. Rhe1 {Bearing down on the e-file where black's king still resides.} Qc7 12. f4 {Beginning a king-side push.} b5 13. e5 Nd5 14. exd6 {Breaking open the center with black's king still in the middle.} Bxd6 15. Nxe6 {Black can't castle through check and he resigns. (edit 8/30 - You are correct that black's choices are sub par.  The point is black may consider castling if at all possible and losing the queen, instead of the devastating attack you mentioned with his king stuck in the middle.  He doesn't even have that option, and either way the position is bad for black.)}
