1. c4 Nc6 {I don't know what this opening is called.} 2. d3 Nf6 {Black is starting to develop his two knights.} 3. Nf3 {So I copy him.} d6 { !? Hmmm.... d5 was better, and either cxd5 or c5 breaks the pawn chain. Something like Nc3, dxc4, dxc4 then Qxd1+ and it doesn't look to good for me. Luckily he played d6.} 4. e4 {Trying to develop my two bishops.} e5 {Well, if he does the same, then hopefully that means I can't move d4, or can I? d4, exd4. Nxd4, Nxd4, then Qxd4, and I have an early queen. (If you want to know more about the early queen, see annotated game: Early queen effects the game)} 5. Nc3 {Simple developing} Bg4 {Uh-oh, but I don't leave it, because, again, I don't want to get a early queen, nor a doubled pawn, so I move...} 6. Be2 {...Be2 to block it. I also prepared to castle in a situation like this.} Bxf3 {Exactly, but do you believe that a bishop is worth slightly more (B=3 and a half, N=3 and a quarter) than a knight, or do you think they are worth the same?} 7. Bxf3 {Done. } h5 {I think your going for Ng4.} 8. h3 {h3's good, because 1. it stops the knight from moving to g4 & 2. it leaves a hole so when I castle, there's not much chance of back rank mate happening either.} h4 {Walking pawns, eh? !?-?!} 9. O-O {I've castled.} g5 {? I don't think Black is watching where he is putting his pawns. What's more, it's gonna be dangerous if he's gonna castle kingside.} 10. Bxg5 {There we go.} Bg7 {Sort of like copying me, just to the wrong square. Anyway, the knight's still pinned!} 11. Nd5 {Pushing on some pressure.} O-O {He wants to castle. But now the rook's moved, I can capture that black pawn on h4.} 12. Bxh4 Ne7 { ? Oops! I think that was just a mistake. Qd7 was the same. } 13. Nxf6+ {I take it with my knight first.} Kh8 {But he doesn't recapture at all.} 14. Nd5 {I move back to d5, attacking the knight. Black should've recaptured.} Re8 {?? Hmmm...} 15. Nxe7 {All done and good. What do you think black shoud've done?} Rxe7 {Now the rook's pinned!} 16. Bxe7 {I capture it as easy as a pie!} Qxe7 {While the queen copes with the recapture right after.} 17. Bg4 {I just didn't know what to do, so I kept the queen of my bishop's diagonal, and the rook moving to c8.} Qh4 {I'm not gonna try the threat of g3, I'm gonna move my bishop. just.} 18. Bd7 Qf4 {Now, I wonder why he moved there for.} 19. Qh5+ {I check easily.} Kg8 {He simply moves.} 20. Bf5 {Trying the threat of Qh7+, but now black's defence is looking fine.} Qh6 {Good.} 21. Qg4 {I pin the bishop now.} Kf8 {The king moves, again.} 22. Rfc1 {People usally move Rac1, but, for the Queen and bishop both on the black square, I need to cope with the nifty Qh2+!} f6 {Ok.} 23. c5 {Trying to get my rook out.} dxc5 24. Rxc5 {Now I'm really trying to attack.} Qd2 {But is he trying to defend himself, or attack?} 25. Rxc7 {Now the looks are fine.} Qxb2 {Funny queen, I thought it was trying to defend.} 26. Rac1 {A rook join up.} Qxa2 {Black does not sense what I'm up to.} 27. Rc7c8+ Rxc8 28. Rxc8+ {There.} Kf7 {All good and done.} 29. Qg6+ {I'm gonna capture that bishop. Mate in 3., First move.} Ke7 {Good.} 30. Qxg7+ {2.} Kd6 {Aha, here come the spectacular mate.} 31. Qc7# {Qd7 was the same, but Qc7 just looked more astonishing!  A very fine, standard checkmate.}
