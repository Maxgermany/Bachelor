1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen"s Gambit Accepted, Standard opening moves. So far ECO D20. The options are varied in this opening 1. Move 3. 3. e3 Nf6, 4. Bxc4 e6 5. Nc3 a6 2. 3. Nc3 a6, 4. e4 b5, 5. a4 b4 } 3. Nf3 {Opening book move.. although e3 could have been played 1. 3. Nf3 e6, 4. e4 b5, 5. a4 c6 and the ECO code is D21. Continuing with D21, alternative moves are 3. Nf3 e5, 4. Nc3 cxd4, 5. Qxd4 Qxd4, 6. Nxd4 or 3. Nf3 c5, 4. e3 cxd4 5. Bxc4 Qc7} Nf6 {Standard opening book move.} 4. e3 {The game now becomes ECO D25 with e3. } Be6 {Queen's Gambit Accepted, ECO D25, Be6? the book moves are either (a)4 ...g6, 5. Bxc4 Bg7, 6. 0-0 0-0, 7. Nc3 Nfd7. with positional advantage for white (b) 4...a6, 5. Bxc4 b5, 6. Bd3 Bd7, 7. a4 b4. with compensation for material (c) 4...Bg4, 5.Bxc4 e6, 6. h3 Bh5 (alternatively 6. Qb3 Bxf3, 7. gxf3 Nbd7, 8. Qxb7 c5).  Here it is apparent that the pawn at c4 is being protected.} 5. Nc3 c6 6. Ng5 {No question here, it is an attack with Ng5, and Qd7 is protecting the Bishop at e6} Qd7 {In 1987, Timman Vs Ljubojevic, won by Timman, the moves were as follows: 6. Ng5 Bd5 7. e4 h6 8. exd5 hxg5 9. dxc6 Nxc6 10. d5 Ne5} 7. e4 {Move # 7. In the match between Korotylev (White) vs Kharlov (Black) in 2004 the moves were as follows: 7. Be2 g6, 8. e4 b5 9. 0-0 Bg7 10. e5 Nd5 11. Nce4 Bf5} b5 8. f3 {Move # 8 In 1997, in the match between Borges (White) and Stephanova (Black) the moves were as follows: 8. f3 Na6, 9. b3 Nb4 10. Nxe6 Qxe6 11. bxc4 bxc4 12. Qa4 Nfd5.  The game was won by White (Borges), In 2000, in the match between Borges (White) and Arobunic (Black) the moves were as follows: 8. f3 g6 9. a4 b4 10.Ne2 Na6 11. Nxe6 Qxe6 12. Nf4 Qd7. The game was won by White.} h6 9. Nxe6 Qxe6 {10. a4 b4, 11 Ne2 if black plays (a) 11...g5, then 12. Ng3 Nbd7, 13. a5; (b) if Black plays 11...Nbd7, then 12. Nf4 attacking the Queen, Qd6, 13 Bxc4 (c) if Black plays 11...Qd7, then 12. Qc2 . Now Black has 2 options either to play c5 in which case White plays d5, or Black plays e6 then 13. Qxc4 Be7, 14. Be3.  Be7 develops the Bishop and enables 0-0 whereas playing c5 additional pressure on the pawn at d4.} 10. a4 Nd5 {Nd5? This is not a good development of the Knight, b4 was a much better option. At this point, 11. Nxd5 cxd5, 12. axb5 Nd7 13. b3 Nb6 appears to be the lines of play.  Nd7 brings the Knight into play and develops the piece. The other alternative for black is g6, which allows the Bishop into play. If Black plays g6, white can respond with either Qc2 or Be3} 11. Nxd5 cxd5 12. axb5 Nd7 13. b3 Nb6 {Move # 13. Nb6? b3 increases the pressure on c4. Black has a few options: (a) Nb6 (b) cxb3.  Nb6, I think, is not a very good options since it appears to be a weak response and not so good of a development of the Knight. Nb6? is protecting the pawn at c4. However, cxb3, I feel, is a better option and it creates a so called "passed pawn" although the pawn is captured by the Q, Qxb3. Move # 14. 14. bxc4 dxc4 which effectively allows Black to open the file "d" against the White King. Rook to an open file is a known play, but Rc8 is not a very valid option right now. Move # 15. White has a few options to play. (a) Be2 (b) Be3 or (c) Kf2.  Playing Kf2 erodes the chance of castling by White. So, I do not think that Kf2 is a good tactical option.  Be2 and Be3 both "unpins" White. Be2 removes the pin and allows White to short castle or 0-0. Be3 unpins the White pawn and allows White to play d5 to try and attack the Black Queen which may not be a good strategy or a good tactical move.  If Be2, then 15. Be2 Qd7 or Qd6. Both Qd7 and Qd6 are not the best tactical development. If 15. Be2 Qd7, 16. Rb1 g6. If 15. Be3 Qd7, 16. Rb1 g6. If, however, 15. Be3 Qd6. 16. Be2 e6 or g6 to allow the Bishop to be brought into play. 17. 0-0 Be7/Bg7.} 14. bxc4 dxc4 {Move # 15. 15 Be3! to allow white to castle and bring White King to safety. Now Black has to move the Queen.  Qd7 or Qd6 are not ideal development of the Queen and is a step backward. The pawn at c4 is already in a safe position defended by the Knight at b6. Moving the Queen does not impede the pawn safety. 15.  Be3 Qd7 16. Rb1 Rc8 or alternatively 16. d5 Qxb5 17. Rb1 Qa5+.  15. Be3! Qd6 16. Be2 e6/g6 to develop the Bishop and allow Black king to castle. 17. 0-0 Be7/Bg7} 15. Be3 {White has 3 options here (a) Be3 (b) Be2 (c) Kf2. If White plays Kf2, white forfeits the right to castle, which from the white King's safety, is not the best or most tactical moves since the exchange of Queens has not taken place as yet. After an exchange of Quuens, t matters little for castling. Be2 simply removes a pin and allows White to castle bring the King into safety. 15. Be2 Qd7 16. Rb1 g6. Black can also play Qd6 in move # 15. However, neither Qd7 nor Qd6 are good development of the Queen. 15. Be3 Qd6 16. Be2 e6 or g6 17. 0-0 Be7 or Bg7} Qd6 16. Be2 g6 17. O-O {White short castles and brings the King into safety. 17. 0-0 Bg7 18. f4!  White has two clear options on Move # 18: (a) Qd2 0-0 19. Ra6 Qd7 20. Ra5 Rac8 and Black occupies the "c" file and Rook in an open file is advantageous. (b) f4! 0-0 19. f5! gxf5 20. Rxf5 Rad8} Bg7 18. f4 {White is now creating space and preparing to attack.} e6 {I think this move by Black, e6, is a mistake. 18. f4!! e6? 19. Bf3 Qc7 20. e5 Nd5 21. Bxd5 exd5 and the game has opened up for White considerably OR 18. f4!! e6? 19. Bf3! Qb4 20.f5 Qc3 21. Bf2 0-0. Chess involves control of the center and White is controlling the center with Bf3! e6 by Black is not a strong move and is a loss of tempo by Black and the move is allowing White to control the center. Instead of e6, Black short castle, i.e 0-0 is a better moves that brings the Black King to safety 18. f4!! e6? 19. Bf3 Qd7 20. f5!  Qd7 is again a loss of tempo. 20. f5! 0-0, 21. f6 Bxf6 22. e5 Bg7 with a srious loss of tempo. Also, the Rook at a8 is also open to be captured although the Knight and capture the Bishop.  Tempo is in favorof White.} 19. Bf3 Qd7 20. f5 {Move # 20. f5 is tactically creating space for white and black's only annswer is to short castle, 0-0, to bring the King into safety.} O-O 21. e5 {Move # 21. e5 by White is creating space with the intention of forking the Black Queen at d7 and the Rook at a8. The Bishop is protected by the pawn and therefore cannot capture the While Bishop. White will play 21. Bc6 forking the Queen and the Rook. The Queen will move to safety and the Bishop will capture the Rook at a8 and Black captures the Bishop with it's rook at f8. Move # 21. 21. e5 gxf5 22. Bc6 Qc7 23. Bxa8 Rxa8. Move # 21... White has the option of playing f6 which is a combination 21. f6 Bxf6 22. e5 Bg7 23. Bc6 Qc7. Bishop is intent to fork the Queen because of the weak development at Qd6 followed by Qd7 in earlier moves. 24. Bxa8 Rxa8.  Chess does not involve losing tempo, and with f6 ONE additional move is required by White which is not appropriate.} exf5 22. Bc6 Qe7 23. Bxa8 Rxa8 {Move # 24.  White has 3 options here. (a) The first is g4 that increases the pressure on f6. Black responds with Rd8. (b) The second option is Qf3 that protects the Bishop at e3 and also threatens the Rook at a8. Black does respond with (i) Rb8 (ii) Rc8 (iii) Rd8 thus bringing the rook into relative safety and black has only one rook whereas White has 2 Rooks. (c) Ra6 which is essentially a menacing and threatening move to which Black responds with (1) Rb8 (ii) Rc8 (iii) Rd8. If (a) 24. g4 Rd8 25.Qf3 fxg4 26. 26. Qxg4 Nd5 27. Bd2 c3 If (b) 24. Qf3 Rc8 25.Rfc1 Qd7 26.Bf2 Nd5 If (c) 24. Ra6 Nd5 25. Bf2 c3 26. Qb3 Rd8 White can also play Rf3 or Rf2, but these are not apprpriate moves.} 24. Ra6 Rc8 {White has 3 options (a) Qa1 (b) Bf2 (c) g4. (a) Qa1 is to attack the pawn at a7. But Black will defend the pawn with Rc7 which is also protecting the pawn at c4. (b) Bf2 brings the Bishop to safety. (c) g4 increases the pressure on f5. Move # 25.  25. Qa1 Rc7 26. Bd2 Qd7 27. Qb2 f6                   25. Bf2 Qd7 26. Qa1 Rc7 27.Rc1 Bf8                  25. g4 fxg4 26. Qxg4 Rc7 27. Rfa1 c3}
