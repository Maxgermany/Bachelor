[Opening "Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation"]

1. e4 {My opponent chose a riskier defense, and then made a few early mistakes and quickly lost. } c5 {Sicilian. } 2. Nf3 g6 {!? Hyper accelerated Dragon. Requires precise play. } 3. d4 {The best way to exploit black's last. } cxd4 4. Qxd4 {Surprise! Here this is actually good. In fact the GK database shows White with a high winning percentage at this point even with best Black play. My opponent seemed unprepared for this.} Nf6 5. e5 {! Keeps up the attack. DB still shows advantage White.} Nc6 {Necessary.} 6. Qa4 Nd5 {What else? } 7. Qe4 {A strong move. } e6 {Weakens the dark squares.} 8. c4 {White is playing aggressively but there is nothing wrong with that here. The GK data base still shows W with a good winning percentage.} Nb6 9. Nc3 Bg7 {?! Risky. Better was first ...a6.} 10. Nb5 {White zeros in on the dark square weaknesses. } a6 {? Black can't afford this move. Better prospects were offered by simply ... 0-0. } 11. Nd6+ {Of course. The idea is not so much just to prevent Black from castling, but to bind Black up with a N on d6 that is hard to eliminate.} Ke7 12. c5 {Here I felt aggression was warranted, because the N would have to move to d5 and could then be attacked by Bc4.} Nd5 13. Bc4 b6 {?? Black can't afford this now. Better was ...Nc7. } 14. Bxd5 {! I calculated that I could open Black's King and win a pawn with threats, and given how quickly White could get the pieces in play Black was in big trouble.} exd5 15. Qxd5 {Threatens mate on f7.} Qc7 {? This loses quickly, but the threat of Ng5 after Black defends f7 was very strong. } 16. Qxf7+ Kd8 17. Qxg7 {Here Black resigns. There is no good defense to the mate threats (Bg5+. QxR+ followed by Qe8) except by moving the Q and then Black is wiped out. }
