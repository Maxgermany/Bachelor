1. e4 {white moves king pawn } c5 {I start sicilian} 2. Bc4 {He brings bishop c4} e6 {I move pawn e6} 3. Nc3 {He brings out knight to c3} Nf6 {I move my knight f6} 4. d3 {white pawn d3} a6 {That is to prepare to move my pawn to b5} 5. Nf3 {knight to f3} d6 {i move pawn d6 to gaurd the center} 6. h3 {not sure why white did this} Bd7 {again to prepare to move my pawn to b5 and also develope my piece} 7. O-O {white castles} b5 {i do as planned} 8. Bb3 {white bishop retreats to b3} Nc6 {i develope knight} 9. Be3 {white bishop developes to e3} e5 {i go for center control} 10. Bg5 {white attacks my knight} Be7 {I protect with bishop at the same time develope.} 11. Nd5 {i knew this was coming but didnt bother me much. would only lead to trades.} h6 {I attack whites bishop with pawn to h6} 12. Bxf6 {white bishop takes my knight on f6} gxf6 {I take with my pawn instead of my bishop so I could move that pawn to f5 opening up kingside and maybe moving rook to g8 eyeing down the kinigs file..good move?} 13. Nh2 {white knight to h2. Nowhere else to go i guess} f5 {I push pawn to f5. if white retakes I can take with bishop and have good position with bishop to f5. } 14. Qh5 {white queen to h5} fxe4 {I take with pawn to e4. Hoping white will take. edit: wow did not see he had me checkmate in two moves. good find paulmorphy.} 15. dxe4 {white retakes} c4 {I move pawn c4 and the bishop is trapped} 16. Ng4 {white moves knight back into the game. } Bxg4 {I just take the knight to blur any attack white had in mind. Not worrying about the bishop on b3 at this time because it is still trapped.} 17. Qxg4 {This is what I was hoping white would do. Now I can attack the queen.} h5 {so I push pawn h5. White cannot take because of rook on h8} 18. Qf5 {i guess white does not want to play passive with a lost bishop so white moves queen f5 which is a big mistake.} Nd4 {I simply move knight to d4. Now I have the queen pinned on f5. The queen cant move anywhere without being taken by one of my pieces. White resigns from here. I wish he hadn't because I had a lot of ideas from here. Im sure you did too. Thanks for watching my game. Hope you enjoyed and I look forward to reading comments on the game and mistakes if any.}
