[Opening "Scotch (C45), Schmidt variation"]

1. e4 {Kings Pawn. My fav opening. } e5 {Kings pawn opening thing.  } 2. Nf3 {Book } Nc6 {More book. } 3. d4 {Ah the scotch. My favorite drink. I mean opening. Yea... *Spanish sucks!* } exd4 {B o o k=3     Wait... Well, I guess that shows what I learned in Algebra...} 4. Nxd4 {More standard } Nf6 {Probably the second most common response next to Bc5 } 5. Nc3 {All book moves. I though about doing soemthing like the Mieses variation with Nxc6 then Bd3 or something, but figured this would be better.  } Bb4 {Trying to grab my e- pawn, eh? } 6. Nxc6 {Now in order to preserve the e pawn,  i have to exchange knights and then protect the pawn. Bad thinking on my part. Bg5 was the only good response. } bxc6 {Deciding to keep the queens on the board, and get his bishop out with an open file for the rook, and supporting da center. Better would have been Bxc3  and then bxc6. Or something like that. I'm probably wrong, seeing as my opponent was a full 200 points higher than me. } 7. Bg5 {Saving the pawn. } h6 {Chasing away da bishop. } 8. Bxf6 {I forgot my reason behind this move, i think it was because i didnt want 8. Bh4 g5 9. Bg3 Nxe4. Or with the bishop taking on c3 sometime earlier. } Qxf6 {Uh oh, Knights in trouble. } 9. Qd3 {Only way to prevent loss, but it could double my pawns. } a5 {...? Protecting the bishop or something? } 10. a3 {Chase it away! } Ba6 {I give it a !? Develops the bishop with a tempo, and threatens the knight if i move my queen to the wrong spot. } 11. Qd2 {Purposely pin the knight. I though about Qe3 and Qg3, but i decided that this would work. } Bxf1 {I expected this, trying to ruin my castle strategy } 12. Rxf1 {Figured i would take with the Rook in order to push the f pawn and keep queenside castling an option. Now looking back, i think axb4 would have been better... although after 12. axb4 Bxg2 13. Rg1 Bf3 (or something) i liked black's position better... } Bd6 {Aiming for the free pawn and moving the bishop away from the pawn. Bxc3 would have left me with doubled isolated pawns, so i thought that that would have been what he would do, but he decides do do this. e5 is looking nice in the future, if i can get enough support } 13. f4 {Speak of da devil. ;) } O-O {e5 fails now, due to a pin with either the Rook or queen, } 14. O-O-O {So i castle to break the pin and create pressure on the d file. However, f4 is looking a little bit scared now... } Qe7 {Preventing e5, and now i'm scared as shit about Bxa3. It destroys my pawn structure and with the b file completely open, it would be very bad. } 15. Nb1 {So i protect it, forgetting about e5. I had no way of protecting both though. I though about something like 15. e5 Bxa3 16. Rf3 aiming for Rg3 then f5 and Qxh6 } Qxe4 {Grabs the pawn } 16. Rde1 {May as well gain control of space } Qf5 {Still has lots of pressure on f4, with a pin threat. } 17. g3 {Protect f4 and h2, and maybe get a pawn storm for the future? } Rfe8 {Trying to get control of the open file } 18. Qc3 {Ignoring the rook 101.I really don't think this was a good move, mainly because he can put a lot of pressure on the queenside right now. } Re7 {Aiming to double his rooks } 19. Nd2 {Get the night out of his hideyhole and into the light. Bxa3 is still a threat } Rae8 {Now with double rooks, and the knight in between the queen and rook, things could get a little ugly } 20. Rxe7 {Trade to relieve some pressure, and a5 is not that well guarded. } Bxe7 {Takes with the bishop in order to go Bf6 and then Rb8, putting loads of pressure. } 21. Re1 {Makin' sure that ain't happening } Kf8 {Makin' sure it could happen } 22. Nf3 {Move the knight to a more useful square } Bf6 {Expected this. } 23. Rxe8+ {Didn't feel like losing material } Kxe8 24. Qe3+ {Had to do this so i didn't lose my queen, obviously. And gained a tempo } Qe6 {If i traded queens, he would be up a pawn, with debatable better pawn structure depending on which pawn he would take with } 25. Qa7 {Threatening the pawn and annoyances. } Qe2 {Threatining the knight and mate on e1 if i move away the Knight } 26. Qb8+ {Zwichsenzug thingy. Get the queen to a better square and then to an even better square } Ke7 {Probably the best option. If Bd8, then I can gain tempo by getting a check on the e file later } 27. Qb3 {Protecting the knight } a4 {Was not expecting this pawn sac though. } 28. Qb4+ {Zchwizenthingy. } Ke6 {I would have blocked with d6, but this forces a pretty even position } 29. f5+ {? Unneeded. I forgot my reason, but my real plan could work now. } Kxf5 {Forced. I was thinking about g4 , but it doesn't achieve anything unless i'm missing a mate. } 30. Nd4+ {My big plan which would have been fine without the pawn sacrifice. He is forced to take, or he loses his queen } Bxd4 {Required } 31. Qxd4 {Required } Qe1+ {?? Loses the game. Or pretty much does. This is the one move i was hoping he would do. It forces a queen trade pretty much, and I get at least one passed pawn. Better would have been Qxh2 } 32. Qd1 Qxd1+ 33. Kxd1 {I may be two pawns down, but i have a passed pawn. } Kg4 34. b3 {!! Gets meh da queenie } axb3 {Forced, so i don't get two passed pawns } 35. cxb3 Kh3 36. a4 {Time to get teh queen } Kxh2 37. a5 g5 38. a6 Kxg3 39. a7 f5 {All expected here. King grabs pawn, then the three passed pawns start advancing. Will my queen be useful enough? } 40. a8=Q f4 41. Qa5 {Now h4 doesnt work } f3 {Charges ahead } 42. Ke1 {Now if f2 , Ke2 followed by Qf5, winning the pawn. } g4 {Protecting the pawn so f2  can work } 43. Qxc7+ {Capture the free pawn with check, but limits my queen's mobility } Kg2 {His pawns are superdooper dangerous } 44. Qf4 {Forced, otherwise f2  wins } g3 {Now things get kind of hairy.  } 45. Qe4 {I thought about 45. Qxh6 f2  46. Ke2 f1=Q but i would be down in pawns, with a very threatening pawn on g3. This at least pins the pawn, so I'm safe for now, threatining Kd2 then Ke3 to win the pawn. Perfect, right? } d5 {WRONG!!! Now i'm running out of options. } 46. Qb1 {I give it a !? Because it prevents the queening, but its a !? because Qf5 would have been better. now f2  is follow by Ke2 and then either Qxf1 or Qf1  and then Qxf2 or something. } h5 {Bringing in the third pawn, also making a somewhat zugzwang time come up } 47. Kd2 {I was struggling for ideas right now. My main hope was that if he did f2, i could go Ke2 and get control. Maybe b4 would have been better, or even Qf5 } h4 {Still bringing in the reinforcement. And i am screwed if that pawn gets to h2. } 48. Ke3 {Now i can go Qf5 and threaten to win the pawn, and after a f2, move the king back to e2 } h3 {Now i started looking for some sort of mate, but nothing came } 49. b4 {? Qf5 wins. or Qd1 } h2 {Now this gets kinda hairy. } 50. Qd1 {! should have been done a turn earlier, this threatens a crap load of stuff. If 50. ... h1=Q 51. Qxf3  Kg1 (or Kh2 or h3) 52. Qxh1 Kxh1 52. Kxg3, and i win. I would have da opposition } d4+ {... This threw me for a loop. This made me think of a very carefully thought out plan. A new one, that is. Same idea with Qxf3 though.    This is where fehlen said that he lost the game, but i don't think he could have won anyways, especially if i had done Qd1 instead of b4 } 51. Kf4 {This seemed best. f2 was looking scary though. I forgot why i figured it was best, only that it works. } h1=Q {?? this loses. Better was 51. ... f2 when 52. Qf3  leads to perpetual check, or a loss. } 52. Qxf3+ Kg1 53. Qxh1+ {Also good would be 53. Qxg3  Qg2 54. Qxg2  Kxg2. My big fear at first 53. Qxg3 Kf1. However,  after 54. Qf3 ! Qxf3  55. Kxf3, it is pretty much won. However, as i write this, 54. Qf3  Ke1 looks the best. AFter 55. Qxh1  Kd2 the passed pawn could pose a slight problem, but it is not really that important } Kxh1 54. Kxg3 {Now i win. pushing the pawn doesnt do anything, and moving the king over can't do anything either. } d3 55. Kf2 {Now black resigned. Hope you enjoyed the game, and the surprising endgame that ensued. Any comments would be greatly appreciated }
