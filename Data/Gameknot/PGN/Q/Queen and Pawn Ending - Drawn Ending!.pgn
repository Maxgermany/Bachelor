1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is a Ruy Lopez game between me and my buddy Rob Jacobs.  This game goes some way to demonstrate that even a one or two pawn advantage may not guarantee you victory in a Q & P ending - this applied to me because although I was a clear pawn up in the final position, that Wicked Witch of the West was perpetually buzzing around Henry.  So, Bob kicks off with 1.e4.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - The Ruy Lopez.} a6 4. Ba4 {4. Ba4 - after the standard a6 Bob's lsb retreats to a4.  I now reply with Nf6 which is the most popular reply in the World DB.} Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 Na5 {7. ...... Na5 - after choosing the Closed Defence I now put a horsie on a5 and plan to exchange it for the lsb to bust up Bob's queenside pawns.} 8. c3 Nxb3 9. Qxb3 {9. Qxb3 - normally it is the a pawn that takes here but, out comes the Wicked Witch!} d6 10. d4 Be6 {10. ........ Be6 - still in the database.} 11. d5 Bd7 12. Nbd2 {12. Nbd2 - development.} O-O 13. c4 bxc4 14. Nxc4 {14. Nxc4 - pawn trade.} Rb8 15. Qa3 {15. Qa3 - the a6 pawn is hanging so Fou Leblanc drops back to his home square to defend it.} Bc8 16. Na5 Bd7 17. Bd2 {17. Bd2 - Bob completes his development - his rooks are now connected.  In the meantime although I am fully developed, guess what ...... here comes ....... passivitis!} Qc8 18. Rac1 Rb5 {18. ....... Rb5 - a break for freedom.  I am also thinking of moving Glenda to b1 next move to pile up on the b2 pawn.  Bob tries to turn the screw with 19. Nc6.} 19. Nc6 Bxc6 20. Rxc6 {20. Rxc6 - I decide to get rid of the annoying knight at the cost of Fou Leblanc.} Rb6 21. Rec1 Rxc6 22. Rxc6 {22. Rxc6 - a rook trade and ...... ah, what's this?  The e4 pawn is hanging.  I decide to let my a6 isolani go in exchange for the e pawn.  This makes the white d5 pawn an isolani.} Nxe4 23. Rxa6 Nxd2 24. Nxd2 {24. Nxd2 - I also decided to trade my horsie for white's dsb.  Next move Glenda sidles on to b7 and has the d5 isolani under her beady eye.} Qb7 25. Qd3 Qxb2 {25. ....... Qxb2 - the Wicked Witch defends d5 but abandons protection of the pawn on b2.  Glenda swoops on the hapless pawn and turns it into prawn for her's and Henry's supper!  Glenda now sees that the Wicked Witch's other half is pretty snug behind a wall of pawns and contemplates paying him a visit!} 26. g3 {26. g3 - but Bob says "You won't get me that way again, Joanne!"} Qb7 27. Rc6 Ra8 {27. ....... Ra8 - now my rook has his eye on the white passer on a2.} 28. Qc2 Bd8 {28. ...... Bd8 - my c7 pawn must be guarded and this is the only way other than Rc8 making my rook passive.  Better Fou Lenoir.} 29. Ne4 Ra6 30. Qc4 Rxc6 31. dxc6 {31. dxc6 - Bob retakes with the pawn, very sensible for if Qxc6?? then Qb1+ will pick off the e4 knight with Qxe4 CHECK.  In order to save Fou Lenoir I would then play Be7 in order to block a queen check on e8.} Qb6 32. h4 g6 {32. ...... g6 - creating luft for Henry.} 33. Ng5 Bxg5 34. hxg5 {34. hxg5 - behold, a Q & P ending!} Kf8 35. Kg2 Ke7 {35....... Ke7 - I centralise Henry as far as I dare.} 36. a4 f6 37. gxf6+ Kxf6 {37....... Kxf6 - one pair of pawns has been exchanged.} 38. Qd5 Ke7 {38....... Ke7 - Henry does his best to avoid being checked.} 39. a5 {39. a5 - this a pawn is becoming dangerous.} Qa6 40. Kf3 Qf1 {40. ....... Qf1 - Suddenly, Glenda goes from the defensive to the offensive, she is threatening a skewer on h1!} 41. Qe4 Qh1+ 42. Ke3 Qe1+ {42. ...... Qe1+ - I am now in a position to capture that nasty a pawn.  Glenda again turns him into a prawn!} 43. Kd3 Qxa5 44. Qh4+ {44. Qh4+ - unfortunately the Wicked Witch has got some checks up her sleeve which win the hanging h7 pawn.} Ke8 45. Qxh7 Qd5+ {45. ...... Qd5+ - another queen fork, this time Glenda decides to feed that c6 prawn to Henry.  That pawn on c6 is also a potential danger to Henry.  But .......} 46. Ke3 Qxc6 47. Qxg6+ Ke7 {47. ...... Ke7 and DRAW OFFER as it dawns on me that Henry may not be able to hide from the Witch.  Bob accepts and it is GAME DRAWN.}
