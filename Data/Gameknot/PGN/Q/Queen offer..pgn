[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 {Sicilian defence. "The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4". Something I learned from wikipedia 2 minutes ago.} 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Qh5 e6 4. c3 Nf6 5. Qf3 Ne5 6. Qe2 a6 7. h3 b5 {Position over the field, or something.} 8. Bb3 Bb7 9. d3 Rc8 10. Bd1 c4 11. Bc2 Nxd3+ 12. Bxd3 cxd3 {Why no take d3 from opponent? => e2-d3 ; b7-e4; queen troubelled+ e4-g2 and big mess in his defense. This setup was a already the key to an artistic evolvement in my chesscurriculum, wich doesn't often happens I have to admit.} 13. Qd2 Bxe4 14. f3 Bg6 15. b4 Qc7 16. Bb2 Qe5+ {Must avoid possible castling in future. Could have put it on g3 also, but no further lefthand-side attack possibilities because of the queen coverage of the pawn at g2.  Also this position of the queen gave me total domination at the centre of the field. In my oponion at least.} 17. Kd1 Nd5 {It seems like I made a mistake here. But the checkmove after opponents pawn c3-c4 with knight d5-e3 regains me one step ahead. But as you will see in the next moves, I took another direction.} 18. c4 Qxb2 {Queen sacrifice. Cause of the perfect position of 2 bishops, knight, and castle.} 19. Qxb2 Ne3+ 20. Kd2 Nxc4+ {Fast recovery. More chance tough for opponent I think if King moved elsewhere in previous step.} 21. Kc3 Nxb2+ 22. Kxb2 Bxb4 {Finishing the game now. If someone has a quicker method of getting him checkmate, always welcome. I took the less risky way.} 23. a3 Rc2+ 24. Kb3 Be7 25. Nc3 Bf6 26. f4 Rxc3+ 27. Kb2 Rc4+ 28. Kb1 d2+ 29. Ka2 Bxa1 30. Kxa1 d1=Q+ 31. Kb2 Qb1# {}
