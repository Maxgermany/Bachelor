[Opening "Four knights (C46), Italian variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {Three Knights game.} Nf6 {Guess what this is called.} 4. Bc4 h6 5. d4 {Was hoping for 5...exd4 6.Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 which would leave me, in my opinion, with plenty of control of the center, better developed and full of tactical promise. But alas, Janshad had other plans...} a6 {Basically I developed during the last two moves while my opponent was trying to play defense allowing me way too much space and initiative.} 6. Nxe5 Nxe5 7. dxe5 {This exchange leaves me up a pawn with initiative and the center so overall I'm happy the way things are going. Only safe squares for the Black Horse are h7 and g8.} Ng8 8. Qf3 {At first I was leery at developing my Queen before my other pieces and got the feeling it was amateurish until I realized it was indeed the correct move.  } Qe7 {I was expecting to pick up at least a pawn here assuming my opponent would play 8...d5 9.Bd5 Qe7 ending the threat on f7 and insuring my Knight would be blocked from a great square by my own pawn. Worst move would have been the disastrous 8..f6. Somewhere in between would've been sacrificing the Knight on f6, which at the end of the day probably led to the best position for Black all things considered.} 9. Nd5 {The assault is on! Threatening  fork of King and Rook on c7 while simultaneously attacking the Queen. Oh, and the Queen can't go too far because the f7 square is about to fall into a mating attack. Blacks best bet is 9...Qc5 10. Nxc7+ Kd8 (if Qxc7 mate follows) 11. Nxa8 Qxc4. White would have the strong advantage but at least Black would have a pulse. Instead....} Qd8 {?? Death Knell! Mate assured via 10. Nxc7 if Qxc7 11.Qxf7+ Kd8 12.Qxf8# and if 11...Ke7 12. Qxf7#   } 10. Nxc7+ {...And Black resigned. The lesson I took out of this game was my simple advantage in initiative and space magnified my opponents small oversights into something impossible to overcome. Hope you enjoyed! }
