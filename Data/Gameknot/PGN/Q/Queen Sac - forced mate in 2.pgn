1. e4 {Going for kingpawn opening} e5 2. Nf3 {developing} d6 3. Nc3 {developing} h6 {There was no threat of me bringing the DSB out ...} 4. Bc4 {developing} Bg4 {the winning pin} 5. h3 {trying to get rid of his bishop, here i have not seen it yet...} Bh5 {keeping the pin} 6. a3 {have not seen it yet} a6 {now I see it...} 7. Nxe5 {looks stupid......, this is a deceiving position due to the power of the 3 minor pieces.  If dxe5, then Qxh5 threatens mate on F7 and attacks e5, leaving me with a pawn up if he plays Qd7, white being much better in development, 3 pieces to one you should be able to convert...  If I had played this on move 5 there would be no threat for mate, it would play out as Qxg4} Bxd1 8. Bxf7+ {dont think he saw it comming, forced} Ke7 9. Nd5# {mate.  I was very pleased that I remembered the move, even though it was 2 moves late.  But the moral is if your oponent keeps his knights in, let it rip........  Please give some comment on any other variations you can spot?}
