[Opening "QGD Slav (D15), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 d5 {My opponent is an Expert rated 12 year old prodigy.} 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 {I used to play Bg5 here, but this leads to many complicated lines after dxc4, e4 b5 and my opponent seems to understand these better than I do.} 5. e3 {According to the computer, this is almost as good as Bg5.} Nbd7 {The right move here is Qc2 according to the Houdini chess engine.  This has the advantage of getting black to commit himself before white plays Bd3.  For example, if black plays Be7 first, then in the game that follows he would not have had the option of playing Qxf6 later.} 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 8. Be2 a6 9. O-O c5 10. d5 exd5 11. Nxd5 Bb7 12. Nxf6+ {Everything up to this point was my opening preparation for this opponent.} Nxf6 {The computer prefers Qxf6 instead.} 13. a4 {I see a chance to take advantage of weaknesses on the Queenside.  Black should play b4 and white will follow with Qxd8+ Rxd8, Nd2 with a tiny advantage.} Qb6 {This is where things start to go wrong for black.} 14. axb5 axb5 15. Rxa8+ Bxa8 16. Qb3 {I see the squares b5 and f7 as weaknesses that I can exploit.} b4 17. Ne5 Bd5 18. Qa4+ Ke7 {Obviously Kd8 doesn't work because of the knight fork on f7.} 19. Rd1 Qc7 20. f4 {The knight needs to stay where it is.  Black's position is so bad that the computer thinks that he should now give up his bishop by playing Nd7.} g6 21. e4 {The computer agrees with this pawn sacrifice to open up the position, but I didn't follow it up correctly.} Bxe4 {White should play Qb3!! with the idea that if black responds Bd5 then Rxd5 keeps the pressure on.  i.e. Nxd5, Qxd5 and now Ke8 fails to Bb5+ and Kf6 fails to Nd7+! Kg7 (Ke7, f5 {Threatens a crushing Bg5+} f6 and now Nxc5 or Bg5! anyway and black is crushed) , Bc4! with mate threats.  If after Rxd5 c4 instead, Nc6+! with the powerful threat of Qe3+, so if Black plays Ke6 (Qxc6, Qe3+ Qe6, Re5), Qe3+ Kxd5, Bf3+ with a crushing king hunt:  Kd6, Qd4+ Ke6, Qxc4+ Kd6, Be3 Bg7, Bc5+ Kd7, Qxf7+ Kc8, Na7+ Kd8 (Kb8, Bd6!), Nc6+ Kc8, Qe6+ Kb7, Nb4+ forces mate. } 22. Bc4 {Bc4 is too slow.   } Bg7 {Now Re1 is the best choice because of the indirect threat on the king.} 23. Nxf7 {Also too slow.  This lets black come back a bit.  } Ra8 24. Qb3 {Here Black could play Ng4, h3 Ra1!, hxg4 Rxc1!, Rxc1 Qxf4 with some counter attack.  After Ng4 white would need to play Qg3 or oddly enough Kf1 to keep his king safer.} Kf8 {Black is technically losing now.} 25. Ng5 {With the obvious threat on e6.} Bf5 26. Be6 {Here black could play Ne4! although he is still losing.  White should continue Qd5 because Bxf5 isn't as good after Nxg5!} Qb6 {Threatening c4+ although White could respond with Qe3.} 27. Be3 {White is totally winning here, but the computer thinks that Qc4 is the stronger choice.} h6 28. Bxf5 {Now for black the computer prefers playing c4 allowing Ne6+ Kg8 (Qxe6 allows Qxb4+), Bxb6 cxb3 etc.} hxg5 {Makes thing worse.  Now Qc4 is the correct choice with the threat of Bxc5+.  This is so bad for black that the computer analyzes black throwing away his pieces with Ne4, Bxe4 Bd4, Bxd4 cxd4, Bxa8.  After Qc4, if black plays Ra5 then Bxg6 Qc7, fxg5 and black gets mated no matter what he does; There are too many threats.  If the knight moves then this allows Rf1+.} 29. Bxg6 {With the mate threat on f7.  } c4 {Now the computer prefers a complicated temporary piece sacrifice with Qxc4 Qxe3+, Kh1 Qe7 and now fxg5.  One possible line here is Nd7 (Otherwise white plays Rf1 and Bh7 threatening mate on g8), Rf1+ Bf6, Qh4! Kg8 (to stop Qh8 mate), gxf6 Nf6, Bd3 (to cover the back rank and threaten Bc4+) Rc8 (Kg7, Qg5+ is easy), Qxf6 with an easy win.} 30. fxg5 {An interesting choice of move order, but it lets black trade his way out of danger.} cxb3 31. Bxb6 Ng4 32. Bc5+ Kg8 33. Bxb4 {This is a mistake because Black can get a winning advantage with Bd4+! and white can't avoid getting forked and he can't take the bishop because of the mate threat.} Bxb2 {Now White has to worry about that b pawn.} 34. Be4 {This helps with the coming Bd4+, but the game is only even.  Better is g3 to eliminate the back rank problem.} Bd4+ {A shocker with knight forks to follow.  Fortunately white is still attacking black's rook.} 35. Kf1 {Now the computer prefers Rd8 with all the threats still intact.  After this white would have to play Re1.  If instead Ke2 then white has some problems after Nf2, Rb1 Nxe4, Rxb3 with a miniscule advantage for black.} Ne3+ 36. Ke2 {Here white has a clear advantage.} Ra2+ 37. Rd2 Nc4 {Both players are getting into time pressure, so mistakes start to happen.} 38. Bd5+ Kg7 39. Bxc4 Ra4 {Here White should play Rxd4 and after Rxb4, Rd7+ and no matter where the black king goes he has problems.  The best is Kg6, but then Bd3+ is easy for black.  If instead Kf8, Rf7+ and now if Ke8 then Rf4 with discovered threats.  So now Ke7, g6 and black queens first, but black's king is in more trouble and the white king can hide from checks by running to g3.    Instead after Rxd4 Rxb4, Rd7+ Kf8, Rf7+ Kg8?, Rc7+ followed by g6 will force mate.  Also after Rxd4 Rxb4, Rd7+ Kh8?, Black has similar problems after Bd5 g2, g6 threatening mate in 1.} 40. Bxb3 {Wrong choice.} Rxb4 {Here White would be winning after h4.} 41. Rxd4 {Huge time pressure blunder.} Rxd4 42. Bc2 Rg4 43. Kf3 Rxg5 {According to my computer, all variations lead to a draw.  Since white has the two pawns, he might as well play for a win.} 44. g4 {Here Rxg4! would draw! } Rc5 45. Be4 Rc1 46. Kg3 Rh1 {With seconds left on the clock, mistakes get made.} 47. Bxh1 {I really like the way I played this game.  I found an advantage right out of the opening, although because of the quick tournament time pressure, both sides made tactical mistakes and missed opportunities.}
