[Opening "Queen's gambit accepted (D20)"]

1. d4 {After a fair time playing 1.e4 and some good results, recent form persuades me to switch back to a Queen's pawn opening...} d5 2. c4 {The Queen's Gambit, in fact.} dxc4 {Which is accepted. It's not usually taken with a view to hanging onto, but I've occasionally had trouble when Black decides to do just that.} 3. e3 {Which explains this. 3.e4, claiming the centre right away, and both Knight moves to c3 and f3 are far more popular, but I want my pawn back right away. Plus there's always the chance Black will play 3...b5, after which 4.a4 c6 5.axb4 cxb4 6.Qf3 wins material right away.} b6 {Instead, and to no real surprise (for me), my opponent decides on a fianchetto.} 4. Bxc4 {It's sooo tempting to play 4.Qf3 and follow up with 5.Bxc4, but it doesn't really create a winning attack, just brings the Queen out prematurely; 4.Qf3 c6 5.Bxc4 Nf6 and there's not much danger to Black.} e6 {But this does surprise me; I'd have thought that, having played 3...b6 then 4...Bb7 was the logical follow-up. } 5. Nc3 {Given Black hasn't developed much, it's possible I may be able to play e4 without really losing a tempo.} Bd7 {Even more curious; Black doesn't play the Bishop to b7 at all. Now he has surely created weaknesses.} 6. Nf3 {I have plenty of time to develop my pieces.} Bb4 {Probably better to develop one of the Knights.} 7. O-O {It was tempting to play 7.Bd2, but if Black wants the exchange 7...Bxc3 8.bxc3 gives me the makings of a solid pawn centre} Bxc3 8. bxc3 {And in fact I get it. Quite happy with this; two Bishops on what will soon be a fairly open board.} Ne7 {Why not to f6? I can't see any advantage in placing the Knight here, though I guess my Bishop going to g5 with the possibility on the e-pawn advancing is enough of a discouragement.} 9. e4 {My dark-squared Bishop is free, my centre pawns unmolested. Lovely.} c6 {Black is not playing well; this just takes away a square from the undeveloped Knight. Maybe he was anticipating 10.d5, but it's the e-pawn I'm looking to advance.} 10. Bf4 {First, I get my other Bishop out, eyeing that hole on d6, especially tempting now Black's exchanged his dark-squared Bishop.} O-O {At least the Black King is away to safety.} 11. Bd6 {I give in to temptation. I can't see where I'm going after 11...Re8 but this just feels strong. 11...Re8 12.Bd3 in readyness for 13.e5 perhaps.} Re8 12. Bd3 Nc8 {The only real way to challenge the Bishop.} 13. e5 {A bit of a gamble. The pawn is going to be a mite hard to maintain on d6, but I'm hoping the cramp on Black's position will give me time for an attack.} Nxd6 14. exd6 c5 {Hitting my strong pawns, but revealing that long diagonal towards the Rook.} 15. Be4 {This is down to the weakness of moving the b-pawn and not placing the Bishop on b7. All the same, I don't exploit it as well as I perhaps could have...} Bc6 16. d5 exd5 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Qxd5 {Now both my Bishops have gone and my only advantage is that pawn on d6, which I'm hoping is enough of a thorn in Black's side.} Nd7 {The pawn's stopped for now. It is perhaps going to be hard to maintain.} 19. Rfe1 {Seems good to challenge for the open file while I have the initiative.} Nf6 {The Knight has rather found a good square for itself, covering h7 and attacking the Queen.} 20. Qd3 {The Queen retreats. Still eyeing h7... you never know!} h6 {Maybe a move Black hasn't got time to make, but it certainly stops any chance of a back rank mate, something I have to be aware of myself as the game goes on.} 21. Ne5 {Kind of aiming at c6, but Black's next move makes me change my plans...} Re6 {A double attack on the pawn, so I try giving up the Knight...} 22. Nxf7 {I didn't know whether this was a dubious exchange or not. Black's best defence seemed to be 22...Qd7, after which 23.Nxh7+ gxh7 24.Qg6+ Kh1 25.Qxh6 makes mincemeat of Black's defence. Whether there's a killer move somewhere, though, I don't know.} Rxe1+ {First Black exchanges, which rather gives me control of the open file. } 23. Rxe1 Kxf7 {Then he grabs the Knight. Now 24.Qc4+ Kf8 25.Re7 is pretty strong, but Black might go to g6...} 24. Re7+ {So I get my Rook in first, thinking that at the least, Black is going to lose an exchange.} Qxe7 {On 24...Kg8 I'd planned 25.Qc4+ Kh8 26.Qf7, thinking that enough to win. But 26...Qg8 and my attack is stymied and I'd probably have lost. So I am fortunate Black gives up his Queen to go into an endgame with only a slight disadvantage.} 25. dxe7 Kxe7 {A slight advantage in material, but that Queen ought to rule the board now.} 26. Qa6 {I didn't know the best way to continue, given my King trapped at the back, but if I'm careful there should not be any real danger.} Rd8 {Probably better to get the King back to avoid a check; this just loses another pawn.} 27. Qxa7+ Rd7 28. Qa4 {Keeping a check on d1, obviously.} b5 29. Qc2 c4 30. h3 {Time to leave an escape square. It also keeps the Knight off g4.} Rd6 {I think Black is trying to get his King behind the Rook with this.} 31. a4 {Ultimately, though, another pawn is falling...} bxa4 32. Qxa4 {The one on c4 can't be defended.} Re6 33. Qxc4 {There it goes!} Re1+ {Black gets in a check.} 34. Kh2 Ne4 {And threatens the f-pawn a little desperately.} 35. f3 {Tempting the Knight to f2..} Nf2 {Where he goes...} 36. Qc5+ {And the fork results in a resignation.}
