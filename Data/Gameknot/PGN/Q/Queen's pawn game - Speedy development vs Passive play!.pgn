1. d4 {Queen's pawn game, one of the most popular first moves of the white along with 1. e4, Here's black has a variety of moves to reply with, 1. ... d5 which usually leads to a queen's gambit, 1. ... Nf6 which usually leads to Nimzo-indian or king's indian defense.} d5 2. e3 {Normally 2. c4 or 2. Nc3 are played, e3 is particularly bad because it blocks the way for the white's queen's bishop.} c5 {A pseudo sacrifice, black is trying to have a majority in the center and to open the c-file for attack, althought 2. Nf6 is frequently played here, this move is very good for black!} 3. dxc5 Nc6 {To prevent 4. b4!} 4. c4 Nf6 {Black refuses to give up his right of castling and develops another pieces!} 5. cxd5 Qxd5 {5. ... Nxd5 was possible but the exchange of queens early in the game diminishes white's advantage substantially!} 6. Qxd5 Nxd5 7. a3 {A strategic error, white's is hoping that he can save his extra pawn but ... a5 in enough to stop this, if instead white played Nf3 or even Bc4! then probably black would have had a hard time attempting to win the extra pawn!} a5 8. Nc3 {Better is Bc4, this move costs white doubled pawns and a increases the black's advantage!} Nxc3 9. bxc3 e5 {Threatening to win the extra pawn and opening the diagonal for the other bishop!} 10. f4 Bxc5 11. g3 Bf5 {Material is even, but black has a great advantage, his pieces are well posted and he has developed three pieces while white hasn't developed any piece, in a few moves black demonstrate how speedy developement can be fatal against passive play!} 12. Nf3 Be4 13. Be2 exf4 {Opening another line for attack, also 13. 0-0 was playable!} 14. exf4 {if 14. gxf4 then white would have had to many isolated pawns and black's would have easily won them!} O-O 15. Bb2 {A really bad move in a hopeless position, the bishop at b2 isn't doing any reasonable task and is blocked by the pawns at a3 and c3!} Rfe8 {Black threatens to win a piece after ... Bxf3!  } 16. O-O-O {A blunder that soon cost white a whole rook, instead if white played Kf1 then white would have had a chance to draw, consider 16. Kf1 Rd8 17. Rd1 Rxd1 18.  Bxd1 Bxf3 19. Bxf3 Re3 20. Bxc6 bxc6 and black has a slight advantage!} Be3+ {Be3 ! is the wining move, white is forced to reply with Nd2 and loses a rook for a bishop!} 17. Nd2 Bxh1 18. Rxh1 Rad8 {White's knight is pinned and black is exploiting this pin with this move, as a general rule, take advantage of a pin as quickly as possible!} 19. Rd1 Rxd2 {Rxd2!! not ... Rd6 attempting to double the rooks on the d-file, black acted quickly and furiously!} 20. Rxd2 Rd8 21. Kd1 {Kd1?, black committed an unforgivable mistake for he would be giving one of his bishops for free, but his position is hopeless anyways!} Rxd2+ 22. Ke1 Rxb2 {And white resigns, he has no chance because of the huge material advantage of almost the same as if black had a queen and a bishop against his bishop. White played really bad, but black was good enought to take advantage of his weak and aimless moves.}
