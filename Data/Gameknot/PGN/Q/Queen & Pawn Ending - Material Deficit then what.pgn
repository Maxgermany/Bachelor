1. c4 {Hi everyone!  This was a real roller-coaster of a game.  I decided it was time to challenge Mike again.  Here are my current stats against him +0, Won: 47 (48%), Lost: 47 (48%), Draws: 2 (2%), 96 games.  So despite the 200 point difference in our rating we are pretty evenly matched and will have soon played 100 games against each other!  Mike has been inflicting a lot of passivitis on me in a lot of my games against him with different eventual outcomes.  In this game it is no different, through a large part of the middlegame, Mike has me tied down.  Glenda briefly leads a break out rally but she is exchanged off and Mike re-establishes his bind with a bone in the throat and more.  Mike releases the bind and there follows a race to the promotion square and wins the race by just one move.  I am also a pawn down.  But will Glenda be able to save the day here?  Please feel free to read the GA below to find out or simply read on.  Mike starts with 1. c4 as he often does and I reply with f5 transposing the game into an Anglo-Dutch Defense.} f5 2. e4 {2.e4 - a gambit.} fxe4 {2...… fxe4 - accepted.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {3. ….. Nf6 - development and defends the extra pawn.} 4. g4 g6 5. g5 Nh5 6. Nxe4 {6. Nxe4 - Mike however wins it back.} Bg7 7. d4 d5 8. Ng3 Nxg3 9. hxg3 {9. hxg3 - knight trade.} dxc4 {9. ……. dxc4 - this is becoming like a QGA!} 10. Be3 Qd5 11. Rh2 {11.Rh2 - Mike takes his rook out of the line of Glenda's fire and threatens Bb2.} c6 12. Ne2 Bg4 {12. ….. Bg4 - pin.} 13. Qc2 Bf5 14. Qd2 b5 15. Nf4 Qf7 {15. ….. Qf7 - Glenda has to move but I am hoping to move her again to a more aggressive square later.} 16. a4 Nd7 17. Bg2 Rc8 18. axb5 cxb5 19. Rxa7 {19. Rxa7 - Mike regains material equality and gives me a bone in the throat - aaargh and double aargh!} O-O {19. ….. 0-0 - well, I have finally done something about Henry, but I will also need to do something about Glenda - firstly watch out for a pin on the g8-a2 diagonal from Mike's light square bishop!} 20. Nd5 Qe6 21. Nb4 Qf7 22. f4 Nb8 {22. ….. Nb8 - this sorry knight will be imprisoned on this square for many moves to come.  Its job at the moment is to cover the c6 square.} 23. Bf3 Rfd8 24. Qc3 Rd7 25. Ra8 {25. Ra8 - maintaining control with a pin on my b8 knight.} Qf8 26. Bd5+ e6 27. Bf3 Rcd8 28. g4 Bd3 29. Nxd3 cxd3 30. Qxd3 Bxd4 {30. …… Bxd4 - an attempt to break out with a plethora of exchanges.} 31. Re2 Qb4+ {31. ….. Qb4+ Glenda joins in the fun and now Mike's pawn on b2 comes under attack.} 32. Kf2 Bxb2 33. Qe4 Qxe4 34. Bxe4 {34. Bxe4 - queen trade.} Bd4 35. Rc2 Bxe3+ 36. Kxe3 {36. Kxe3 - bishop trade.} Kf8 37. Rb2 Re8 38. Rxb5 Rdd8 39. Ra7 Nd7 {39. ……. Nd7 - the knight finally moves but now Mike is about to give me a hell of a bind! } 40. Rbb7 Re7 41. Bc6 Ke8 42. Ke4 Rf7 {42. …… Rf7 - either that or g7.} 43. Rbc7 Re7 {43. ……. Re7 - the defensive shuffles carry on.  Now Mike releases the bind and gives me a pawn deficit.  Here it comes!} 44. Rcxd7 Rexd7 45. Ke5 Ke7 46. Rxd7+ Rxd7 47. Bxd7 Kxd7 48. Kf6 {48. Kf6 - and now a decisive penetration by King Mike.  I have my finger hovering over the resign button here but suddenly I have a better idea!} Kd6 49. Kf7 Kd5 50. Kg7 Ke4 {50. …… Ke4 - the answer is Henry lunching on Mike's f4 p(r)awn.} 51. Kxh7 Kxf4 52. Kxg6 e5 {52. …… e5 - the promotion race now begins.} 53. Kf6 e4 54. g6 e3 55. g7 e2 56. g8=Q e1=Q {56. ….. e1/Q - boy am I glad to see Glenda - she increases my chances of avoiding defeat from zilch to slender!} 57. Qc4+ Kg3 58. g5 Qf2+ 59. Kg6 Qb6+ 60.

Qf5+ Kh4 {63. …… Kh4?? - this move should have lost me the game according to GA.  Thankfully Mike overlooks this continuation and played 64. Qe4+?} 64. Qe4+ Kg3 65. Qe6 Kh4 66. Qf6 {66. Qf6? - this move throws away the win and brings the match to a dramatic finish.} Qh5+ 67. Kf5 Qg4+ 68. Ke5 {68. Ke5 - if Kg6 Glenda just checks him again on h5 and it will lead to perpetual check.  } Qxg5+ 69. Qxg5+ Kxg5 {69. ……. Kxg5 - after all the fireworks just the two kings are left on the board - a draw by dead game - even though I have conceded a low draw here (thankfully the game was unrated) things could have been so much worse so it is certainly a case of wheew and triple wheew!}
