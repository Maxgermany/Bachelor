1. Nc3 {I game where I get a nice attack that leads to an early checkmate. Of course my opponent did make mistakes.} d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. h3 {Not wanting a Bg4, but white needs to work on development on move 3} e6 4. Be3 {Opening my dsb, blocking my lsb, but the action is on the queen side.} Nc6 5. f3 Bb4 {Pinning the knight. } 6. Kd2 {?? My opponent believes that castling is weak for his king. I'm going to show him all the reasons this move is wrong.} e5 {Claim to the center} 7. a3 exd4 {Winning a pawn and forking his knight and bishop} 8. Bxd4 Nxd4 9. axb4 {equalized} Nf5 10. Qe1 {Looking to get his queen in play maybe?} d4 {Here we go} 11. Ne4 Nxe4+ 12. fxe4 Qg5+ 13. Kd3 {Kd8 was met with Ne3+ and a discovered check on the next move which would be deadly to white, but even that is better than this. } Qe3+ 14. Kc4 Be6+ {Bringing my pieces to attack} 15. Kb5 a6+ 16. Ka4 Bd7+ 17. b5 Bxb5+ 18. Kb4 c5+ {The good check I could find} 19. Kxc5 d3+ {Discovered Check!} 20. Kd5 Qd4# {Hope you enjoyed this little mating attack. }
