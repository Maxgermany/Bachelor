1. e4 {White begins with the very solid 1. e4.} e6 {Black responds with the rather meek 1 ...e6?} 2. d4 {Punishing black for his mistake and grabbing control of the center.} Qh4 {Whoa! Black's getting ambitious!} 3. Nc3 {White continues development among normal lines. A transition into a Danish Gambit main line is certainly possible here.} d5 4. Nf3 {White plays the brilliant move 4. Nf3!, attacking Black's queen.} Qh5 5. Be2 dxe4 6. Nxe4 Nf6 7. Nfg5 Qh4 {Terrible move! Black allows his queen to be trapped.} 8. g3 {8. g3!!! White takes full advantage of the overextended queen!} Nxe4 9. gxh4 Nxg5 10. hxg5 {White is ahead material, and now begins trading down pieces to arrive at a highly favorable endgame.} Nc6 11. Bf4 Bb4+ 12. c3 Bd6 13. Bxd6 {Trading pieces.} cxd6 14. Bb5 O-O 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. Qf3 d5 17. O-O-O Rb8 18. h4 f5 19. gxf6 e.p. Rxf6 20. Qg3 Rg6 {Not realizing that his rook is hanging, black foolishly tries to harass White's queen. However, White was attentive this game, and grabs the rook.} 21. Qxb8 {At this point, a hardy "gg noob" was declared by White.} Kf7 {Black makes a desperate thrust with his monarch.} 22. Qxc8 Kf6 {And black resigns.}
