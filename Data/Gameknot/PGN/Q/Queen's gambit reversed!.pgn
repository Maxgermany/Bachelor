1. d4 {Well I am black in this game} Nf6 2. e3 c5 {? I am not sure if this is the proper way to start the Benoni. Please write a  comment to let me know. } 3. c3 {?? a dubious move. White is allowing me to develop} e6 4. Nf3 a6 5. Nbd2 d5 {!! I give myself 2 explanation marks.  I am playing a reverse queen's gambit.  White has been developing very timid and now I set claim in the center.  Notice My d5 pawn never gets captured} 6. Be2 Nc6 7. a3 {??? very timid} Bd6 {I did not want to move my queen or light squared bishop yet and I was planing to castle. please grade my move } 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. b4 Bd6 {?? after playing the game I think I should have played Ba7...} 10. Bb2 Bd7 {A quiet move} 11. O-O {At first I was stumped on how to continue playing the game, but I myself being a Queen's gambit player soon seen a mirror image and played a move that I play as white} g5 {!!! My favorite gambit. I usually play this move as white against black (g4). If anyone knows the name of this move, inform me } 12. c4 {!? white has now moved this pawn twice} g4 {continuing the attack} 13. Nd4 Rg8 {side steping the pin by Bb2 and protecting the g pawn} 14. g3 {?! I am still playing this gambit a move behind.  He should have captured my pawn on d5} h5 15. Nxc6 bxc6 {Reducing minor pieces; I reinforcing my center, now if he captures my d pawn I recapture with my c pawn} 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. Qc2 h4 18. Qh7 O-O-O {? I do not know what to think of this move. King-e7 would also work} 19. Qc2 hxg3 20. fxg3 Qh6 21. Qa4 {!! Now do you see why I should have played ke7.  Double edge sword play.  My king being all lonesome and cramped needed to run } Qxe3+ 22. Kh1 {Capturing any piece would leave my king open to check and even draw} Rdf8 {!!! opening space and protecting a vital pawn. WATCH THIS PAWN} 23. Qxa6+ Kd8 {Moving towards e7} 24. c5 {!?} Bxg3 {!! I know how to sacrifice my pieces} 25. Qd3 Qxd3 26. Bxd3 Rgh8 27. Nb3 {?} Rxh2+ 28. Kg1 f5 {!!! The winning move. Notice how white is unable to protect himself or any counter attack? Sure the A and B files are open but the pawns will not promote in time!} 29. a4 Rfh8 30. a5 Be5 31. Rab1 {???} f4 32. a6 f3 33. a7 Rg2# {}
