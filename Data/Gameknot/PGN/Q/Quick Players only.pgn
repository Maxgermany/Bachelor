1. e4 {my normal opening} e5 {a normal start} 2. Nf3 {i attack and get ready to castle} Nf6 {look like he is copying me} 3. Nxe5 {i take the pawn} Nxe4 {he takes the pawn} 4. Bc4 {i get ready to attack f7} Bc5 {he does the same for f2} 5. Nxf7 {i have queen/rook} Kf8 {i don't request computer analysis, but moving the queen would of been better} 6. Nxd8 {i take queen} Ke8 {he could attack f2 at any minute} 7. Nf7 {i protect my knight} h5 {blunder in my opinion... he should of moved castle} 8. Nxh8 {and so black has lost two pawns, queen and castle for a mere white pawn.... } a5 {i don't quite know what black is doing, but i have a plan} 9. Qxh5+ {check} Kf8 {he moves there, should of moved to e7 so he could escape d6 way} 10. Qf7# {which gives me checkmate.... hope you enjoyed. feel free to comment as i read all your comments and take it on board.... i enjoyed this short game and i always try and start a quick players only game.... feel free to join}
