[White "Me (1656)"]
[Black "Opponent (1432)"]
[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 {Starting up with e4, taking control over the center as early as possible as well as allowing the LSB and the queen to go out.} c6 {The Caro-Kann. Usually a solid defensive option for Black, but not in this game!} 2. d4 {Taking furthermore control of the center.} d5 {Contesting my e pawn.} 3. e5 {The advance variation.} Bf5 {All book so far.} 4. g4 {!? Immediately chasing the bishop, but also weakens my kingside.} Bg6 5. h4 {Pursuing the bishop.} h6 {Creating a hole so the bishop can retreat. 5.h5 is also an option.} 6. h5 {Chasing the bishop away again!} Bh7 7. e6 {! A powerful move. It forces light-square weaknesses in Black's camp. If this threat is not addressed correctly, it can be pretty devastating. This is also my seventh pawn move and none of my pieces has moved yet!} f5 {? Wrong reply, but not a game losing blunder. Taking the pawn is the best option.} 8. Bd3 {Here is the reason; Black can't properly defend his f pawn in this position.} fxg4 {?? This move allows a nifty trick that wins at least a piece for white.} 9. Bxh7 {! This move weakens even more the light squares around the Black king.} Rxh7 10. Qd3 {Now I fork the h7 rook and I threaten mate on g6. There is no way to save both.} Qd6 {Black understandably chooses the lesser of the two evils, which means he will depart from his rook.} 11. Qxh7 Qxe6+ {Black has at least taken my e pawn. He is relieved from its pressure and has put me in check.} 12. Ne2 {I decided to block with the knight. It didn't have any other square to go anyway.} Nf6 {Understandable development that also chases my queen away.} 13. Qg6+ {Preventing Black to castle queenside. I'm also pinning the Black knight on f6.} Kd8 14. Nbc3 Na6 {14.Nbd7 was better. My opponent told me he wanted to get some counter-play on the queenside, but it didn't work well for him.} 15. Bf4 {Cutting off some squares on the queenside. It also allows me to castle queenside as well.} c5 16. O-O-O c4 {Black cannot allow the d file to open. Sample line: 16...cxd4 17.Rxd4 Nc7 18.Bxc7+ Kxc7 19.Nxd5+ looks pretty bad for Black.} 17. Rhe1 Qc6 18. Bg3 {Leaving place for the knight to jump on f4-e6, a strong outpost.} b5 {Black tries some counter-play, but it is too slow.} 19. Nf4 {Just as planned. If 19...b4, then 20.Ncxd5 wins a pawn and brings another piece to the action. (Note: the knight on f6 is pinned to the queen, so it can't capture back on d5 for now.)} Nc7 {Black sees this and defends his d pawn.} 20. Qf7 {! Attacking the poor bishop that never got a chance to get out.} Kd7 {The king moves to allow the rook to protect the bishop, but it is losing. Relatively better was 20...Qe8.} 21. Ng6 {! Very strong. Black has too many threats to deal with. He can't avoid massive loss of material.} Ne6 {Black tries to cover his bishop, but missed a bigger threat!} 22. Ne5+ {Black resigns, as he is about to lose his queen and get mated in a few move. }
