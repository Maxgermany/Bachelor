[Opening "QGD (D32), Tarrasch defence"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 {QGD Semi-Tarrasch defence. Black gives up a pawn for rapid development. However after 4. cxd5 blacks pawns are a bit weak in the centre.  } 4. dxc5 d4 5. Ne4 Bxc5 6. e3 {White can not take the Bishop due to Qa5 . e3 is a solid move attacking Black's over extended centre pawn. } Nc6 7. Nf3 Bb4+ 8. Bd2 dxe3 {Black takes advantage of white's pinned bishop and force whtie to weaken his kingside pawn structure. } 9. fxe3 {I would say that black has the advantage here because white has two major weaknesses; c4 and e3. } Qb6 {defends the bishop and puts preasure on e3} 10. Be2 Nge7 {Bad is 10. ...Qxe3 because of Nd6 } 11. O-O {release the pin on the bishop. } Bxd2 {A serious mistake by episode which loses the game. Better was either Nf5, f5. After this black never recovers. } 12. Nd6+ {black must have missed this move. I am sure he was thinking of playing Qe3 . But I played a simple in between move that lands black in hot water.} Kf8 13. Qxd2 Nf5 14. Nh4 {This is stronger than Ng5 for white. After Ng5 black can play f6} Nxe3 {So black wins the e3 pawn, but now he has to worry about f7!} 15. Rxf7+ {The rook crashes down on the king with another in between move. The king begins to sweat.} Kg8 16. Nxc8 {prepares the invasion of the Queen to d7 and deals with the potential discovery check by the Queen on b6} Rxc8 17. Qd7 {threatens mate on g7and the capture of the rook. } Nf5+ {calls check and defends g7} 18. Kh1 {Black has no more counter play} Nce7 {black tries to break the communication between Q and R  and protect the F5 knight, put speeds the end} 19. Nxf5 {This destroys all of the defenders for the black king. } Nxf5 20. Rxg7+ Nxg7 21. Qxc8+ Ne8 22. Qxe8+ Kg7 23. Qe7+ Kg6 24. Rf1 {mate in 4}
