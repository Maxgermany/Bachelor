[Opening "QGD (D51), 4.Bg5 Nbd7"]

1. d4 {This game is a typical QGD. There is a lot of position play. Both players have strong bishops. White however goes down two pawns early. Is that enough for black to win? Lets find out } d5 2. c4 e6 {I think ...e6 is widely regarded as black most solid reply to Queens Gambit. However, dxc4 is completely playable. ...Dxc4 does lead to more open and attacking lines. } 3. Nc3 Nf6 {this is a bit inferior to Be7. The point of ...Be7 is that it discourages white from playing Bg5.} 4. Bg5 Nbd7 {intending to meet Bxf6 with Nxf6 to perceive the pawn structure.} 5. cxd5 {This releases the tension in the centre. This move was a favorite of WC Petrosian.} exd5 6. e3 c6 {The queens gambit declined normal defense. This defense has become very popular lately. } 7. Bd3 {A natural square for the bishop it controls e4 and aims at the weak h7 square. The Bishop is well placed here. } Be7 {Black opts for the solid Be7 instead of the opportunistic Bb4. ...A6 is also playable } 8. Qc2 {adds to the control of e4 and pressures h7.  For white the critical squares are e4 and e5. For Black they are d5 and c4. } h6 {This creates a weakness at g6 but it is better than allowing white to capture on h7.   see this link for an example: http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=8118505} 9. Bh4 Nb6 {on route to d6 and allows black to develop the light bishop.} 10. Nf3 Be6 {prepares for Nc4 and developing the bishop.} 11. a4 {this creates an unnecessary weakness on the queen side. } Nc4 12. b3 {booting the knight out of c4. White can also play Bxc4 with a good game. The text move has the disadvantage of creating a backward B pawn. I would prefer Bxc4. } Nd6 {From here the knight gaurds e4 and waits for an opportunity to jump back to c4. } 13. a5 {I wonder if this is a testing move by white. This move cramps black on the queen side but the pawn is over extended and in need to protection. } O-O {I am in no hurry to open the position up before I am completely developed. Right now I am a little cramped but my position is very solid. } 14. Ne5 {a good central post for the knight. This makes going back to c4 with my knight a lot harder. } Rc8 {preparing for the freeing c5 break which undermines the E5 Knight. } 15. b4 {attempting to prevent c5 but creates a hole on c4. } Nc4 16. O-O {16. Bxc4 allows black to free his position with dxc4. } g5 {a move that creates a permanent weakness on the light squares in front of the king. but it gives black some freedom to move. } 17. Bg3 Bxb4 {after this all of whites hopes are on the king side. } 18. Na4 c5 {This is a critical move at a critical time. All I can say about this move is that it felt like the right time to open things up. } 19. Nxc5 Bxc5 20. dxc5 Rxc5 {black has the IDP but it is an asset not a weakness.} 21. Rfd1 {taking aim at the IDP} Rxa5 {Sometimes the best defense is to simplify the position.} 22. Bxc4 Rxa1 {This allows me to gain the advantage of eliminating White's strongest bishop} 23. Rxa1 dxc4 {This links the IDP to the rest of it's friends on the queen side. Now I have a chance of creating counter play on the queen side. } 24. Nxc4 Nh5 {This leaves me with a better endgame. I have two outside connected pasted pawns and the bishop vs. a knight ending. } 25. Nd2 {The best move 25. Bd6 fails to....  25. ...Re8 26. Bc5 Qd5 and black has a clear advantage.  } Nxg3 26. hxg3 Qb6 {This keeps the pawns connected. } 27. Rb1 Qa6 {I thought long and hard about this move. Positionally I have the advantage because of the weakness of whites badly placed Knight and overloaded queen. I have a small spacial advantage. However, spacial advantages are very hard to convert to wins. I felt confident that I have a winning position here. If I am patient than I will slowly increase my advantage.   The technique of converting a space advantage is as follows:  1. Restrict your opponents moves. Make him feel like a python is around is nest. The more he struggle the tighter the restriction.   2. The Breakthrough. By virtue of your opponents cramped position he will eventually create a weakness in order to create breathing room. This opens the position up for a breakthrough that most of the time is done through a sacrifice that creates a permanent serious weakness in the defense of the king.  3. Winning combination.   So How can I restrict my opponent.   This is the best move that I can see. Any other moves allows white to exchange the pieces. After which, my small space advantage dissolves. This however, restricts White's queen. White can not allow Black to play Qd3.   if 28. Qb2 Qd3(White can not move off the 2nd rank because that would hang his knight. This is a amplifies the fact that the queen is overloaded.  } 28. Nf3 {The Knight is better here. However the queen is still tied to the defense of the rook. At the moment white is passive, all he can do is wait for black to slip up.} Rc8 {bring in my last piece into the game and gaining control of the c file. } 29. Qd1 Rc5 {You got to maximize the potential of all your pieces.  } 30. Nd4 Bd5 31. g4 {The fatal blunder. White does not have time to play this. } Be4 {Black's dominace over the queenside is now complete. } 32. Ra1 Ra5 {White timed out here. But as you can see he has run out of good sqaures. }
