1. d4 {My favorite first move as white, as I'm more familiar with Queen's Gambit type situations. } d5 2. c4 dxc4 {Queen's gambit accepted.} 3. e4 {3.e3 or 3.Nf3 are often played also.} c6 {Ofcourse 3...Nf6 or 3...b5 are options here. } 4. Bxc4 {Taking back the pawn.} e6 5. Nc3 h6 {?? This move weakens the kingside pawn structure for no reason. At this point I allready saw a potential bishop sacrifice on h6.} 6. Nf3 Nf6 7. O-O {Developing and bringing my king to a safer spot.} b5 8. Bd3 {This bishop needs to go to d3 anyway, now it's like an x-ray aim on h7 and soon I'll play e5 to unleash it's full potential.} Be7 9. Bf4 {I want to double up on this diagonal with my queen, so I have to move my bishop first.} Nbd7 10. Qd2 {Voila..} O-O {Ok, here it comes...} 11. e5 {First get the knight out of the way and simultaneously clear the diagonal for my light squared bishop!} Nh5 12. Bxh6 {! Nice move! It's also nice to see how all the white pieces are active in the attack. (the knight on c3 will jump to e4 in some lines to assist.)} gxh6 {It might be better not to take the bishop here...but white is obviously better.} 13. Qxh6 {Threatening mate on h7 ofcourse.} Ndf6 {13...f5 14.exf6 Ndxf6 also looks good for white.} 14. Rae1 {I like this move..I've been reading this book called 'Excelling at Chess calculation' by Jacob Aagaard, a great book by the way, where he speaks of finding 'candidate moves'. Ofcourse taking the knight wins back material, but I decided to look a bit further and found this move! It doesn't threaten anything for now, but black should really feel the pressure on the kingside building up.} Re8 {? This move loses instantly, but it's hard to find good moves for black.} 15. exf6 {Mate is inevitable now!} Nxf6 {15...Bxf6 leads to forced mate after 16.Bh7  Kh8 17.Bg6  Kg8 18.Qh7  Kf8 19.Qxf7# } 16. Ng5 {! } e5 {There's no defence. Now it's mate in three.} 17. Bh7+ Nxh7 18. Qxh7+ Kf8 19. Qxf7# {Checkmate! Hope you enjoyed the game. }
