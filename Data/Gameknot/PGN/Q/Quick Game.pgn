1. Nf3 {This is a lightly annotated game which features an English-type setup against an Old Indian Defense.  The game starts as a slow positional maneuvering battle but turns tactical around move 22, when I offer an exchange sacrifice for the chance to cement two knights on the 6th rank!} d6 2. c4 {2. e4 could transpose into the Pirc or Modern.} Nd7 {Another possibility is 2...Bg4 followed by this move.} 3. g3 e5 4. Nc3 c6 {This move gives Black pawn control of d5 and also prepares a later break in the center.} 5. Bg2 Ngf6 6. O-O Be7 {Not a very popular opening these days, the move 6...Be7 makes the Black position more passive than the Fianchetto.  Still, Blacks position is solid and without any weakness and his plan of a center break with ...d5 is straightforward and good.} 7. d3 {7. d4 would head straight for the main lines, but this move keeps control of e4.} O-O 8. Rb1 {Here, I wasn't too sure how to proceed, as I am not too booked up on the Old-Indian.  The best way to play this, is 8. e4, which not only prevents Black's ...d5 break in the center, but leads to a Botvinnik setup where Black's knights are misplaced.  ***FYI*** the Black knights need to be on c6 and e7.  White then proceeds with h3 and Be3, with a better game and the plan of queenside expansion.  } Qc7 {Black is at least equal here.} 9. b4 {Since I have defaulted to the standard English queenside counterplay, I have to stick with the plan and play consistently.  A decent plan now is better than the best plan later.} Re8 {Here, the immediate 9...d5 looks strong.  In fact, the more I look at this, ...Re8 looks like a strategic error.  It seems that I can now hold up the ...d5 advance and Black's passive position will become rather uncomfortable.} 10. Qb3 {The Black setup has left the light-squared bishop at home to defend the queenside, so the only benefit to this move is to hold up ...d5.  My plan of advancing the queenside pawns to create weaknesses is the quickest active plan for White as it follows logically from my 8th and 9th moves.  The only problem with this is that it's rather easy for Black to stop, as he does in the game, by routing the queen's knight to e6, via f8.} Nf8 {A standard plan in these positions, the knight will come to e6, where it will exert pressure on the d4-square.  Here, Black opts to keep the light-squared bishop at home, often times, due to the lack of space, Black will play ...Bg4 followed by ...Bxf3, to weaken the d4-square and create more breathing room for his pieces.  Only then will the knight come to e6, when Black is doing fine.} 11. Bg5 {Taking an opportunity to exchange the knight on f6 to weaken the d5-square, a consequence of Black's passive play.} Ne6 12. Bxf6 Bxf6 13. a3 {I like this better than a4, as knight on e6 can jump into c5 the pawn advances to b5.  Black has held up my queenside expansion, however, I still have a slight plus due to the space advantage on the queenside and the initiative provided by holding up Black's counterplay.  I now have to switch to the center in order to keep my initiative.} g6 14. e3 {With no obvious tactical shots or immediate way to open the position, I need to slowly improve my position, by cementing my center control and getting the rooks to their optimal squares.  A space advantage is a static imbalance.  As long as Black's counterplay is stifled, I have time to maneuver into a favorable position and when I am ready, to open the position with attacking chances.} Rb8 15. Rfe1 Bg7 16. d4 {A consequence of not trading the light-squared bishop.  The back rank interference makes the pawn push possible on tactical grounds.} exd4 17. exd4 Bd7 18. Rbd1 {White's advantage grows.} Rbd8 19. d5 {With all of the pieces placed optimally, now is the time to attack.} Nf8 {Obviously not, 19...cd 20. Nxd5, when the out post on d5 makes Black's position unbearable.  Also, not 19...Bxc3 20. Qxc3 cd 21. Rxd5, when the d-pawn is very weak.} 20. Ne4 Bf5 21. Nd4 {White's pieces are extremely active.} Bg4 22. dxc6 {!!!} Bxd1 23. Rxd1 bxc6 24. Nxc6 {The knight is immune, due to the discovered attack on the queen after 24...Qxc6 25. Nf6 .  A pawn and a bishop for the exchange and Black's pawns are wrecked.  This would be more than enough compensation for the exchange, but now my knights take up permanent outposts on the 6th rank.  White is winning.} Rd7 25. Qd3 {d6 is falling soon.} Kh8 {The knight is now hanging.} 26. Nxd6 {Discovered defense!} Re6 27. c5 {The knights setup camp and decide to stay for a while.} f5 28. a4 {No immediate tactics, but if you look to the queenside, you will see that the plan of a4, a5, b5, b6 and after the exchange, b7 b8=Q, can't be stopped without sacrifice!!!  Black is paralysed.} h6 29. a5 Nh7 30. b5 Rdxd6 {The realization sets in.} 31. cxd6 Qd7 32. Nb8 Qd8 33. d7 {Here Black resigns as he can't stop the promotion of the pawn, without further sacrifice.}
