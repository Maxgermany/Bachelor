1. e4 {Kings Pawn} e5 {Normal response} 2. Nf3 d6 {So far everything standard} 3. Bc4 Bg4 {I have a plan and this is when it came about.  Potential checkmate soon.} 4. Nc3 {Gearing up towards it.  If it doesn't work atleast i have development} Nd7 {Now its all over.  } 5. Nxe5 {Setting the trap.  If he captures with his knight then I have a problem because his bishop is protected.  Leave a tempting sacrifice.  Will he accept?} Bxd1 {Game over.} 6. Bxf7+ Ke7 7. Nd5# {Pretty. :-)}
