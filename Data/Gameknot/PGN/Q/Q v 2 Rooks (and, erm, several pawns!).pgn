1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Here is one long struggle, against a player called Cristiana (aka mantidereligiosa) from Master Skorpio's Group.  Cristiana mounted a very strong middlegame attack against Yours Truly who attracts passivitis like a fly to a leg of ham!  This attack gained two pawns.  I tried to restore the balance a little more in my favour by conceding two rooks and a few pawns and retaining the services of Glenda.  Glenda did her best, but alas, with the formation of the pawns, it was impossible for her to get a draw through Ye Olde Perpetualle and I ended up resigning our game on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate,  So, how did this happen?  Well, read on.} f5 {2. ..... f5 - this is a themed Welcome MT called The Dutch Defense.  Black counters in the centre by means of the f pawn.  Black must attend to the possibility of a queen check down the Fool's Mate diagonal.  However, a timely knight move to f6 normally addresses this issue.} 2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 e6 {3. ..... e6 - solid - but already I am falling into a familiar style of play which will not serve me well in the middlegame.} 4. Bf4 Nf6 5. e3 c5 6. Bb5+ Nbd7 {6. ..... Nbd7 - would the bishop interposition been a little better?  Perhaps not, because it may well allow a knight incursion to b5 threatening a nasty fork on c7.} 7. Ng5 Qb6 8. Be5 Ke7 {8. ..... Ke7 - Henry reinforces the protection of the pawn on e6 and gets out of the pin.  However, giving up the right to castle in the opening with the queens on the board is a step not to be taken lightly!} 9. dxc5 Qxc5 {9. ...... Qxc5 - pawn trade.} 10. Bd4 Qc7 {10. ..... Qc7 - Glenda is forced to retreat.} 11. Qe2 h6 12. Bxd7 Bxd7 {12. .... Bxd7 - B for N trade.} 13. Nf3 a6 14. Be5 Qc8 {14. ..... Qc8 - and now Glenda must retreat further into her shell.} 15. O-O Be8 16. Rad1 Kf7 {16. ..... Kf7 - preparing castling by hand.} 17. Rd3 Be7 18. Rfd1 Rf8 19. Bd4 Kg8 {19. .... Kg8 - mission accomplished.} 20. Ne5 Bc5 21. Nf3 Ne4 {21. ..... Ne4 - black looks to have improved her position here but looks can be deceptive.} 22. a3 Bh5 23. Qe1 Bxd4 24. exd4 {24. exd4 - bishop trade.} Qd7 25. Ne5 Qe7 26. Ne2 Ng5 27. f3 Nf7 {27. ..... Nf7? - here is the move where it all goes south.  It is intentioned to elimiate the knight on e5.  Unfortunately my bishop, Fou Leblanc is en prise after Nf4 with nowhere to go.  The only way to save him is to trade knights but it brings the Wicked Witch of the West into that bally square e5.} 28. Nf4 Nxe5 29. Qxe5 Be8 30. Nxd5 {30. Nxd5! - taking advantage of the pin on the e6 pawn as Glenda is hanging behind it.} Qf7 31. Nc7 Bb5 {31. ..... Bb5 - counter-attack but it does not quite cut the mustard.} 32. Re3 Rac8 33. Nxb5 axb5 34. c3 {34. c3 - my pawn on c5 is hanging.  The move c3 was to prevent the counter-thrust Rxc2.} b4 35. axb4 {35. axb4 - the best way to lose it is by doubling the extra queenside pawns.} Rfe8 36. Rde1 Rcd8 37. d5 {37. d5 - threatens to win a third pawn so I decided to take some drastic action.} exd5 38. Qxe8+ Rxe8 39. Re3xe8+ Kh7 {39. ..... Kh7 - after that plethora of exchanges and Henry dodging the castle fire, we have Glenda against two rooks and a pawn.  Because my remaining pawns are so split, they are sitting ducks for the rooks.} 40. Re8e7 Qh5 41. Rxb7 Qg5 42. Rd1 Qe3+ {42. .... Qe3+ - a bit of a spite check.} 43. Kf1 Qe5 44. h3 Qe3 45. Rd7 Qb6 46. Rd7xd5 {46. R7xd5 - could not prevent that d pawn from dropping off.  Glenda vainly tries to counter-attack the relatively weak queenside pawns.} Qa6+ 47. b5 Qa2 48. Rxf5 Qxb2 {48. ..... Qxb2 - at last one white pawn falls.  Alas the rest are pretty solid.} 49. Rc5 Qc2 50. Rd6 Qc1+ 51. Kf2 Qb2+ 52. Kg3 Qa3 53. Rcc6 {53. Rcc6 - two rooks together are a formidable force.  Despite Glenda being such a powerful piece, she is limited to the squares she can attack because of the squares the white pawns and rooks control.} Qc1 54. Rd5 Qe1+ 55. Kg4 Qa1 56. c4 Qg1 {56. .... Qg1 - Glenda continues to make empty token threats.} 57. g3 Qe1 58. Rd7 Qe5 59. f4 {59. f4 - preventing all ideas of Ye Olde Perpetualle.} h5+ 60. Kh4 Qe8 61. Rcc7 Kh6 62. Rdxg7 {62. Rxg7 - another black pawn falls.} Qd8+ 63. Rge7 Kg6 64. Rc6+ Kf5 65. g4+ {65. g4+ - here I wave the white flag as I cannot prevent mate in 3.  Now, as an exercise, I think we should have some answers on a postcard from the Inquest Jury as to exactly how this mate can be forced.  Anyhow, as a result of my defeat, Cristiana's rating soared into the 1900s (it is currently 1912 as I write) and has deservedly become a near-Expert.  Well played Cristiana!  I will be writing on another game of Cristiana's, one of where she achieved a Master Draw against her mentor, Skorpio, Klaus very soon so watch this space!}
