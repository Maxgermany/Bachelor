1. e4 d6 {Hmmm...not uncommon.} 2. d4 {Might as well go ahead and lay claim to the center.} Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {Preparing to fianchetto.} 4. Bg5 c6 5. e5 dxe5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+ {Expected, and I was ready. The real question is, is my opponent ready? } 7. Rxd1 Ne4 {?? I guess not.} 8. Nxe4 f6 9. exf6 exf6 10. Bxf6 {He resigned. Which is good, because saving his Rook loses the game, eventually. Thank you for reading, please R&C!}
