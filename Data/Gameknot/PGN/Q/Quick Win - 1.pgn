1. e4 {In this game black makes an early error and loses quickly.} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 d5 4. exd5 exd5 5. d4 c4 {? This is a serious miscalculation, black can't hold this pawn formation.} 6. b3 b5 {? Best is ...cxb, ceding central control.} 7. a4 Bd7 8. axb5 Bxb5 9. bxc4 dxc4 10. Bxc4 {! Of course. Black loses the pawn since if BxB Qa4+} Bd7 {? Still, the exchange instead of this retreat would prolong the game, since now the LSB is strong and bears down on f7.} 11. Ne5 {! Commences the attack.} Be6 {?! If ...Nh6, BxN wins, but this does not work either.} 12. Bxe6 fxe6 13. Qh5+ {Of course. } Ke7 {? The fatal blunder, but Black did not want to lose the R after ....g6, Nxg6! and if ...Nf6, Qb5+. Now White forces mate in 3...} 14. Qf7+ Kd6 15. Ba3+ Kd5 {Forced.} 16. Qf3# {A pretty checkmate, where Black's K is trapped in the very center. }
