1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 {Queen's Gambit Decline. Orthodox Defense. } 4. cxd5 {Carlsbad variation.} exd5 5. Bg5 {This is played so White doesn't end up with a bad bishop when pawn e3 is played} Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Qc2 {Not book move per se, more common is Bd3.  White can play 7.Bd3 and later play Qb3} c6 8. Bd3 h6 9. Bf4 {This cuts into Blacks position than retreating the Bishop to h4. Later on in the middle game, this Bishop attacks Black's back rank on b8. } Be6 10. h3 {Creating an air luft for the King and Bishop} Nbd7 11. Nf3 Re8 12. O-O Bf8 {?! More common is Nf8?} 13. Rab1 {? a mistake on my part. Ill preparing the minor attack pawn-b4. } a5 {!} 14. b3 {Blocking 14...a4} Bb4 {?! a mistake?} 15. a4 {! Now White is preventing Black's minor pawn attack!} Bxc3 {? Black will now have chronic dark square weaknesses in the middle and endgame. } 16. Qxc3 Ne4 17. Qc2 Ndf6 18. Ne5 {preparing f3} Nd6 19. Rfc1 Rc8 20. b4 Nd7 21. Bh7+ Kh8 22. Bd3 {And here I pondered on 22. Ng6+ for clearance to capture 23. BxNd6. But that wouldn't work out to well for my light square bishop. } Nf6 23. f3 Nd7 24. bxa5 {Creating an open b-file} Ra8 {? I had anticipated Qxa5 and minor pieces exchange on the d-file to follow.} 25. e4 {I did this 1) to objectively to create a lever and 2) with Bishop d2 in mind to protect the a5-pawn.} Nf6 26. Be3 {Now I reneged to protect my d-pawn! Black can force exchanges on the e4 square and black can capture on d4 with check!} Rxa5 27. Bf2 {Now I am moving away from the treacherous e8-Rook!} Qa8 28. Nxc6 {This constitutes a combination, but is not forced. That's important to note because Black can decline and play 28...Qc8 or 28...Rc8. Clearance and pawn fork tactic.  Minor piece sacrifice. Not sure what to grade it Instead of defending the a-pawn I had moved towards a central attack. } bxc6 29. e5 Qd8 30. exd6 Qxd6 31. Be1 {It was about this time I notice my King's Fortress is filled with gaping holes and prone to ...Bxh3. } Ra7 32. Rb6 Bd7 33. a5 {Minor piece attack!} Rea8 34. a6 {!!} Ne8 35. Bb4 Qf6 {If 35...Qg3, then 36. Qf2} 36. Bc5 Nc7 37. Rb7 {!!} Ra7xa6 38. Bxa6 Nxa6 39. Rxd7 Nxc5 40. Qxc5 {Black resigned. }
