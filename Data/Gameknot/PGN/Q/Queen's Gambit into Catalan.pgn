1. d4 e6 2. c4 Nf6 3. g3 d5 4. Nf3 c6 5. Bg2 Nbd7 {A game starting with Queen's Gambit into Catalan. What you'll see shortly is some confusion and denial as to the pawn sacrifice, and then the ensuing tension around that and a surprise ending. Annotated by inspecteur_snail as White. This sequence probably best viewed in the interactive mode, as there are an abundance of comments.} 6. Bg5 {This move was a bit of a reflex, since there had been no movement on the Black DSB. I was envisioning a pin on that knight here, and a likely black move to DSB to e7 to relieve the queen pin.} dxc4 {Since I had assumed at this point it was a Gambit declined, I was not expecting this move and it caught me off guard, leading to a bit of an unusual follow-up...} 7. Nbd2 {Here is where the denial starts for White and the next sequence of moves all revolve around this absurd pawn on c4 that I am trying to extract vengeance on.} Nb6 {As part of my blind rage, I forgot to notice that Black had opened with Queen Bishop to d7 FIRST, rather than the usual c6. Post game computer analysis gives Black a very slight edge for these two moves, but what I didn't realize was that the difference was so negligible I should have just moved on with my life.} 8. Qc2 Bb4 {At this point I realized Black didn't have any plans of his own, and was equally focused on this pawn. Even more determination set in. But now I needed to remove this pin...} 9. O-O {So, I removed the pin on the knight on d2 here to avoid any catastrophic failures. At this point, post-hoc computer analysis even had me up 0.08 points, I thought I was down miles at the time in the game.} Bxd2 10. Nxd2 {This here was silly, and I'm a bit surprised computer analysis didn't take any notice of the following move. I had been so focused on the black pawn that I forgot about the newly opened file on D for the Black Queen...} Qxd4 {Now I needed to pull my act together. How to remove this cursed pawn and get rid of this queen at the same time. What was burned in my mind was the exchange of kxc4 exacting my revenge, black knight kxc4 in retribution, and I'm screwed since the black queen would get the last word and be in troublesome position for me. But not if I could remove that extra coverage for the square on c4...} 11. Be3 Qe5 12. Rab1 {Post-hoc computer analysis had this as a blunder for me, and that makes a bit of sense in hindsight. I moved the rook here to prevent the Black queen from getting the last word and capturing on b2 after the exchanges on c4, but forgot to notice White LSBxc6+, and a pawn recapture here means black is in for some punishment after the white queen x again on c6+ forking the rook on a8. Ah well.   Instead, the situation simply became more entrenched} Nfd5 13. Qe4 {And I try to relieve pressure prematurely here, post-hoc computer analysis has instead White DSB x b6. Seems decent enough, hell would have broken loose and I would have had a rook in the center of the board by itself but still be down 1 pawn.} Qxe4 {Black agrees on it, but mainly because the Queen doesn't have too many options at this point.} 14. Bxe4 Nxe3 15. fxe3 e5 {After the exchange I'm now down 2 in material by accident, and not in a perfect position. Basically I've caused more harm than good by now and am hoping for something to materialize. That black knight on b6 is really starting to earn it's weight in gold at this point. I *am*, however, happy about this semi-open f file since there are no queens and black has no DSB. I'm hoping I can leverage this in the future (foreshadowing).} 16. Bf5 {Here I'm hoping for the exchange, giving my rook some good position to claim back some pawns.} g6 {The interesting bit here is that the post hoc computer analysis ENCOURAGED the exchange, so actually what I wanted was bad for me. Instead chalking this move up as a blunder for black and recommending the exchange following by black castling *QUEENSIDE*. Well that sure would have thrown a wrench into my plan. Instead, this pawn move caused me enough grief I elected to force it myself.} 17. Bxc8 Rxc8 18. Ne4 {And for the first time, I give up for now on the pawn on c4. I'm down more material, I think black was a bit surprised but handled it well. I'm hoping to jump into the outpost on f6 and try to cause a scene, maybe fork something, claim the open d file with the rook now on b1. Who knows.} Ke7 {But he sees my plan. signal_11 is basically in my head at this point and it is frustrating. In post-hoc computer analysis, this is almost the furthest I am behind in the entire game, clocked at -2.62. In a few moves in has me at -2.88, but I actually disagree on that one.} 19. Nc5 {Now I'm hoping for a mistake and just seeing if I can cause some damage.} Rc7 {No mistake here.} 20. Rbd1 {At least I get the file I wanted as a consolation.} Nd5 {Le sigh. Luckily I notice he is going in for the fork on e2. Gotta take care of that...} 21. Rf3 {Seems like the best option. This is where the computer has my position at -2.88. Not sure this is much worse than the other one, because at this point I start to see myself stacking the rooks on the f file in the near future (f3 and f1).} f5 {Saw this coming, a minor inconvenience. My pawns are in place for this.} 22. e4 fxe4 23. Nxe4 b6 {I thought this was a wasted move, but flag this in your mind for later. We'll call it future preventative defense against a position I hadn't thought of yet. Not sure if Black saw it then, or simply didn't want my knight to go back there for the time being.} 24. Rdf1 {Alright, stack is complete and I'm actually feeling a bit better about the position. I've worked my post-hoc computer score back to -1.46 by now.} Rd7 {And disaster. What a great counter move. My next planned move (which I still do anyway) is f7, and now I start to think I may not be able to get the kind of damage I need done to happen. I spent a long time on the next two moves where almost nothing happens. Spend some time going through all of the possible exchanges with f7...} 25. Rf3f7+ {I play it anyway. Maybe he moves in one of the better directions for me...} Ke8 {Nope. Okay so many possible exchanges. d7, for example, just doesn't work out well. I could even throw in knight to f6+, King can then take the rook without the stacking. All sorts of trouble, bad positions. Just so much that wasn't good here. And remember that move earler where now Black is covering c5 with a pawn? Well, that prevents mobility that may have made a series of checks profitable for me. So that leaves us to...} 26. Rf7f3 {This is very similar to the position before, and at this point, I'm hoping signal_11 is a bit distracted and gets comfortable with the lead. My hope here is that f6 *now* looks good, since my rook is out of the way. With a bit of luck maybe I can get some traction here...} h6 {I think this move was not in Black's best interest, handing me some initiative. Post hoc computer analysis doesn't have it as a blunder, but I'm guessing he is hoping to play rook h8-h7 perhaps. I'm curious what his plan was here. Point is, no change for me, let's see what happens when I push the knight up...} 27. Nf6+ {Nice fork here, some of this is vengeance against that Black Knight. Really been causing me grief this whole game.} Nxf6 28. Rf3xf6 Rd2 {I expected that now this would become a pawn cleaning battle, and I thought (hoped) I'd have the upper hand with two active rooks, but at this moment, I realize I even have a chance to get lucky coming up with what is a deceptive apparent pawn cleaning situation... note that right now I have fought back to -0.99.} 29. Rxc6 {Looks innocent enough, I bet he saw it coming too. And that pawn on b2 sure is looking easy to capture for him...} Rxb2 {Success, the bait has been taken. (FYI Computer later suggested Rook h7, followed by various pawn removal and misc trouble).} 30. Rc8+ {Ouch, almost messaged him apologies on this. Just a crushing hit in such an intense game.} Kd7 31. Rxh8 Rxa2 {At this point I stop to be careful, I count all the pawns and realize how much trouble I could be in if I screw it up closing it here. I expected him to push the pawn to c3, and it turns out so did the computer later, but the advantage was still heavily in White's favor. This just made it a bit more so. After running a few calculations...} 32. Rf6 {This looks like its a closed deal at this point. King can walk towards the rook, but it can get enough distance by a capture on g6 to be able to do the standard two rook combination close. signal_11 resigned at this point we both thanked each other for the game. I think this was a pretty exciting match with some ups and downs, and it would have gone on much longer if it wasn't for that nasty skewer on move 30. }
