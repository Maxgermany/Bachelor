1. d4 Nf6 {Gary kasprov describes dis as the best defence} 2. c4 e6 {he stops me from taking on the center (a comman move)} 3. Nc3 {i decide to open up my queenside players} b6 {now in my eyes dis is a bad move as it aloows me to open up evrything ....... and i can easily take d center as well} 4. e4 c5 {dere's a hole in his defence and hes not patching it (b7).... i expected Bg7} 5. d5 {I have no intention of giving up the center} Be7 {perparing for a castle........} 6. Nf3 { its time for me to develop my kingside as well now} O-O 7. Bd3 {this has to purposes one to castle and the other to attack the h7 pawn} Bb7 {finally  he patches things up there and develops his queenside} 8. Ng5 {more attention is brought to h7 .....  i expected 8.h7 but.... } exd5 {he igonres the threat .....  i aint gonna play his game} 9. e5 {e5 is the major move in dis game} Re8 {Re8 an attempt to destroy my consolidated position in d game  this leads to exf6 bxf6  ......  bxg5  and it also opens movement space for his king to avoid a quick mate } 10. O-O {O-O may hinder my attack caz now it is risky to bring my kingside pawns on attack.... but } dxc4 11. exf6 {2 pawns for a knight is not preferable until d end game black is in trouble} Bxf6 12. Bxh7+ {kf8 is the only option otherwise it results to a fork } Kf8 {i am not sure how to continue my attack should move h4 or f4 .....  f4 will block out my bishop   and h4 is not d ideal move for a castled king  shld i just withdraw my bidhop becaz i fear g6  to block it completly} 13. f4 {now that i think of it h4 wud have been the better move } d5 {He ignores the threat again d5! at dis point of time  how long does he think his king  will survive in dis battered state   d5 might win him half d board but  please that is useless when u have a check mate approaching} 14. Qh5 {A checkmate appears in f7......... Now here are the following list of conditional moves which ensure his doom  • 14. ... Ke7 15. Qxf7  Kd6 16. Qxb7  • 14. ... Bxg5 15. fxg5 g6 16. Bxg6  • 14. ... Re7 15. Bg6  • 14. ... g6 15. Bxg6 fxg6 16. Qxg6 Re7 17. Nh7  Rxh7 18. Qxh7 } Qd7 {Who cares if  i didnt see one  move so what he is in a bad position and that will be exploited } 15. Nxf7 {A new set of conditional moves  15. ... Qxf7 16. Bg6 Qe7 17. Qh8   and 16. ... Qd7/Qc7   then 17. Bxe8} Re7 {he threatens my knight to stay on the safe side ne5 would be good but i settle for something more risky} 16. Bg6 {Now i decide to risk it lose my piece advantage to gain positional advantage Bg6! } Rxf7 17. Qh8+ {no protection for the king i can attack and develop and so i chose} Ke7 18. Re1+ Kd6 19. Bxf7 {bxf7 finally i kill the rook i am tempted to move f5 but  then i guess i risked to much for one game} Qxf7 20. f5 {f5 this move   opens up alot of things  i can do so much  for eg if  he moves   20. ...  Be5  21. Nb5   Kc6  this gives me so many options like eat the bishop and get his king to move to b5  (the further into my base the better) or 22. Qc8 and proceed with th above plan  or i can move 22. a4 a strong position  OR   I he tries attackin me        } Nc6 {20. ... Nc6  21. ...  a move that lets me attack directly at him } 21. Bf4+ {i chose Bf4  because i enables me to  free another rook of mine and conquers important squares} Kd7 22. Qh3 {I am forced to retreat i hate new position now my chance to  attack has more a less gone   I expect Nb5 as it results interesting outcomes} Nd4 23. Rad1 a6 24. Be5 Re8 {now thisis how i hope the game will go  24. Be5 Re8  25. Bxd4 Bxd4   26. Kf1 Rxe1   27. Rxe1 Bxc3  28. bxc3 d4  29. f6  Kd6  30. Qg3  Kd5  31. Qf3  Kd6  32. Qf4  Kd5  33. Qe4  Kd6  34. Qe5  Kd7  35. Qe7  Qxe7  36. Rxe7  Kd6  37. Rxb7 d3  38. f7 Kc6  39. Ra7  } 25. Bxd4 Bxd4+ {a check......} 26. Kf1 {wrong move on my behalf.... BIG TIME bad calculations Kh1 was better } g6 {he exploits my mistake} 27. Rxe8 {I decide when that a silent exchange will work the best for me} Kxe8 28. Qf3 Qxf5 29. Qxf5 gxf5 30. Ne2 {I still want to exchange } Be5 31. Nc3 {I show my intentions clearly} d4 32. Re1 {I pin his bishop and offer the exchange} dxc3 33. Rxe5+ Kd8 34. bxc3 {The game has jammed and nothing can be done for his victory} Be4 35. h4 {A queen is gonna b made.......} Bd3+ 36. Ke1 Kd7 37. h5 Kd6 38. h6 {i want it take it.. but then u will have to put up with my queen after that} f4 {he decides a queen is gonna kill him pretty badly} 39. Rh5 Ke6 40. h7 Bxh7 {Black resigns ...... White Wins .... Look at all the options be4 u play}
