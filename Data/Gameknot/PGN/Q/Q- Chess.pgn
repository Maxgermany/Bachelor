[Opening "French (C18), Winawer, advance variation"]

1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4 {This move initiates the Winawer , and pratically forces 4.e5} 4. e5 c5 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 {Black has managed to give white doubled pawns but at the cost of a strong center and an attack. } b6 {This move prepares 7.Ba6 which exchanges off black's bad bishop which is a good idea in almost any version of the french. } 7. Qg4 {An important idea in the Winawer. As Black either has to demolish his kingside with g6, or play Kf8 , giving up the right to castle. } g6 8. Bg5 Ne7 9. Bd3 {It's unclear where the Bishop should go so maybe the immediate h4 was better. } Ba6 10. h4 {Threatening h5 which destroys the black kingside. The next move is pratically forced. } h5 {This move stops to h5 invasion but has the downside of making white's dark squared bishop incrediblly powerful, as any attempt to castle kingside can be quickly met by Bf6. } 11. Qf3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 Qd7 {Releasing the pin and preparing Qa4 which would lock up the entire white queenside. In general in the Winawer you want to prevent the queen from getting to the a4 square. } 13. Ne2 {White decides that moving the black queen again so soon will give white a big attack . White decides on Ne2 because once the black knight goes to f5 white will quickly play Ng3. } Nbc6 14. O-O {White doesn't fear an opposite sides castling as black can make no progress on the white king due to the strong g5 Bishop. } Nf5 15. Ng3 {Trying to eliminate the powerful knight. } Rc8 {?! I think this a slight mistake as the f5 outpost is useless after Nxf5. Better was Nce7 when black's queen is threatening Qa4 and the e7 knight adds extra support to his f5 knight. } 16. Nxf5 gxf5 17. Kh2 {This move is a sort of waiting move as white wants to see what black will do before deciding on a plan. } Ne7 {?? This move is a serious positional mistake as on e7 the knight can go nowhere useful. The only threat, Qa4, can be easily blocked by A4 and white should have the superior game. Much better was Na5 intending Qa4 or Nc4. } 18. a4 Qc6 {Black trys to win a pawn after cxd4, cxd4, Qxc2. } 19. Ra3 {!? An interesting pawn sacrifice which leaves black bound up. } cxd4 20. cxd4 Qxc2 {?! A slight mistake as now white keeps black tied up for the rest of the game. Better was Qc4 when it is hard to see anything better than accepting the ending when the position is about level. } 21. Qa6 {A tricky move as the a7 pawn is threatened along with the skewer Rc1. Finally the point of Kh2 is seen as the check along the back rank after as after Rc1, Qxc1, Bxc1, Rxc1  saves black material. } Qc7 {Defending agianst both threats. } 22. Rc1 Qd7 23. Rxc8+ Nxc8 {Forced . As Qxc8 Qxa7 loses a pawn. } 24. Rc3 { Another  interesting idea is 24. Qb5 as after Qxb5 axb5 leaves all of the black pieces are tied down. } O-O {?? A huge mistake as now the attack can finally come. Forced was Ne7 when white has blacked tied up but white still has to work. } 25. Bf6 {! Now the bishop comes into the attack with descisive effect. Probably best for black is Kh7 and Kh6 , trying to hold back the white queen , though eventually white will break through. } Ne7 {? This last blunder now leads to forced mate due to the weak black king. } 26. Qe2 {! The key move as now h5 can't be defended and the threats of Qh8 mate, Qg7 mate, and even Rg3 are imposssible to defend. } Rc8 {Trying to trade pieces and distract white from the mating threats. } 27. Qxh5 {Now black is in serious trouble as mate is threatened on h8 along with Rg3 check. } Kf8 {Black's move is a last ditch effort to survive though even after Qh8 Ng8 Rg3 mate can't be avoided} 28. Qh6+ {Black resigns as after Kg8 , Qg7 mate and after Ke8 Qh8 Ng8 Qxg8 mate. This game is a good game showing how sometimes the best way to refute a gambit is to decline it. If black declined the c2 pawn in this game the endgame would of been about equal but instead he got snared in the attack. Also remember if you have a big attack look for mate before accepting material.}
