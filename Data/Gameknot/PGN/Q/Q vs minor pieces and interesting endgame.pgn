1. e4 {Here's an interesting end-game from a recent league game against an opponent who has provided me with a number of challenges recently.} c5 {My usual response to 1.e4: the Sicilian.} 2. Bc4 {White avoids the sharpest book lines.} e6 {Contesting d5} 3. Nf3 a6 {While White concentrates on developing his kingside minor pieces, Black uses his pawns to restrict their scope, particularly aiming for queenside pawn expansion and theatening to entrap White's KB.} 4. a3 {Creating a bolt hole for his bishop} b5 5. Ba2 Bb7 {Finally developing a piece} 6. d3 Nc6 7. Be3 Nf6 {Now Black catches up on development} 8. h3 d6 {To defend e5 against an advancing pawn} 9. O-O Be7 10. c4 O-O {At this stage, Black's development is slightly better than White's: one more minor piece out, but there's little in it.} 11. Qd2 Na5 {Not quite sure what was in my mind here...trying to get something going anyway...} 12. b4 cxb4 13. axb4 Nc6 14. Na3 bxc4 15. Nxc4 d5 {having provoked White into advancing a N onto c4, Black has a target for his pawn advance.  White's b-pawn also looks weak.} 16. Nb6 {White exploits the hole in Black's queenside} Bxb4 {so Black nicks the pawn, threatening White's Q to offset the threat to his Ra8} 17. Qc2 d4 {pressing on} 18. Nxd4 Qxb6 {White's recapture with the N has cut off his defence of b6 but this capture exposes Black's Q to potential revealed attacks ...} 19. Nxe6 {as demonstrated by this move} Qxe3 20. fxe3 {Inspired by the Annotation Project, I sac my Q for two White pieces} fxe6 21. Bxe6+ Kh8 {White's extra pawns give him a notional +2 advantage at this point but Black's minor pieces are very active.} 22. Qc4 {But White's Q and B are even more active.  All the momentum is with White at this point} a5 23. Qb5 {Threatening Black's wsb.  If it moves, the QN falls} Nd8 {defending the B and attacking white's} 24. Bf5 Bc6 {Black continues to push back at White's attackers} 25. Qc4 Rb8 {occupying an open file and double-defending the B on b4} 26. Rab1 Bb5 {continuing to harass White's Q} 27. Qc2 Nc6 {improving the worst minor piece and connecting the rooks} 28. Rf4 Ne5 {again improving the N, this time also threatening White's d pawn and a skewer of Q and R} 29. Rh4 {attacking h7, which can be followed up by a Q check, so apparently counteracting Blck's last threat} Bxd3 {Black plays the skewer anyway} 30. Qc7 {White increases the pressure on Black's king's position and attacks the N on e5} Nf7 {Moving from a threatened position and providing an extra block to the pressure on h7} 31. Rb2 {and White now dodges the attack from the B} Ng5 {improving the defence of h7 and attacking e4} 32. Qf4 {attacking the N} Nfxe4 {defending the Ng5 by taking on e4 with the Nf6} 33. Qe5 Bd6 {attacking the Q and revealing an attack on the undefended R on b2.  That N on e 4 is earning its pay!} 34. Rxb8 Rxb8 {Black couldn't take the Q first because of the back row mate by Rxf8} 35. Qa1 {White's Q avoids landing on a threatened square but not the next threat} Rb1+ {Forked!} 36. Qxb1 Bxb1 {Now Black is three minor pieces to a rook up: +4} 37. Rg4 h6 {When you have superfluous knights (one defending the other), you need to bring more defences to bear on them, else they can't move if attacked.} 38. h4 Nd2 {Deliberately avoiding the obvious ... but giving up material.} 39. Bxb1 Nxb1 40. hxg5 hxg5 41. Rxg5 {Now Black is only one point behind.} a4 {Seeking to promote the most remote pawn} 42. Ra5 {correctly getting the rook behind it} a3 43. e4 {counter-attacking in the centre} Nc3 {defending Black's pawn's next square and simultaneously attacking White's pawn} 44. e5 {exposing the overloading of Black's B} Bb4 45. Ra8+ {The White rook, forced to move, gains a tempo on Black's king} Kh7 46. e6 {allowing the pawn to advance again} Nd5 {Black double-defends e7 rather than advancing his own pawn} 47. Kf2 {White's K advances towards the centre, either to eventually support the e-pawn or to stop Black's a-pawn} Be7 {blocking the e-pawn while still defending the a-pawn and releasing the N for action} 48. Kf3 Kg6 {Now Black's K joins the race for the centre} 49. Ra5 {and White plays a tactical attack on Black's N} Nc3 {supporting the pawn's next advance} 50. Ra7 {attacking the B and trying to prepare Black's e-pawn's further progress} Kf6 {Black's K meets those threats} 51. Ra6 a2 {one step closer to heaven...} 52. Ke3 {Now White threatens to disturb Black's defence of his a-pawn} Nd5+ {pre-empting the attack with one of Black's own} 53. Ke2 Bb4 {The B wasn't completely tied and now threatens to support the pawn's further advance.  White can't take on a2 because of the fork on c3.} 54. Kd3 Bc3 {looks risky because of the threat of double attacks on N and B by K or R} 55. Kc4 {which White seeks to exploit but ..} a1=Q {!  Black seizes the chance} 56. Rxa1 Bxa1 57. Kxd5 Bb2 {Black prepares to occupy a3, covering d6 and e7, while maintaining distance from White's K} 58. Kd6 {White's K tries to shepherd the e-pawn home but...} Ba3+ 59. Kd5 {Since White can't successfully advance the e-pawn any more, he prepares to support his other remaining pawn and attempt to halt the progress of Black's pawn} Be7 60. g3 g5 {reducing White's options going forward} 61. g4 {Next move, White will have to move his K unless Black releases the e-pawn.  This will lose him his e-pawn.} Bf8 62. Ke4 Kxe6 63. Kd4 Bg7+ 64. Ke4 Be5 65. Kf3 Bf4 66. Ke4 Bc1 67. Kd4 Kd6 68. Ke4 Ke6 {Around here, White offered a draw but Black was determined to exploit his material advantage.  First objective is to push White's K back from e4 then to close in on the pawn on g4 and push the Black pawn through, using the B's extra moves to avoid stalemate.} 69. Kd4 Bb2+ 70. Ke4 Ba1 71. Kf3 Ke5 {Objective 1 achieved!} 72. Ke3 Bb2 {Re-establishing the opposition.  White has to cede ground to Black's K.} 73. Kf3 Bc1 74. Kg3 Ke4 75. Kh3 Kf3 {White's defence of g4 has quickly become impossible but he still has potential stalemate opportunities.} 76. Kh2 Kxg4 77. Kg2 {White reclaims the opposition.} Be3 {but Black's bishop enables him to turn the tables.} 78. Kh2 Kf3 {Black aims for f2, from where he can support the pawn home} 79. Kh1 Kf2 80. Kh2 g4 81. Kh1 {Now, if Black is careless, ...g3 gives stalemate, so...} Bd4 82. Kh2 g3+ {and now the pawn will sail home.  White resigned.}
