[Opening "Vienna (C25), Hamppe-Muzio gambit"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {The Vienna game. White plays modestly and hopes for a king's gambit position where the extra moves will help white. } Nc6 {Black also plays conservatively. After 2. Nf6 3. F4 3. d5 the game becomes a falkbeer counter gambit. } 3. f4 {Now white goes back to normal lines of the King's gaambit with Nc3 and Nc6 included. } exf4 4. Nf3 g5 {Black's intentions are to hold the pawn and play d6 , a very solid system. } 5. Bc4 d6 {An interesting idea would be g4 0-0!? gxf3 Qxf3 when white has a huge lead in development for the piece. } 6. O-O Bg4 7. h3 {Immediatly putting the question to the bishop. After Bxf3 white would reply gxf3 and would have a big center and a surprisingly safe king for the pawn. } Bh5 8. d4 {White now gets a big claim of the center and a big lead in development. } Bg7 {Attacking the vulnerable d4 pawn. It looks as if black is doing great right now as the pawn seems to be forced to go to d5.} 9. Bb5 {(!) Not a great move, as it is main line king's gambit theory , but important nonetheless to try to keep an advantage. } a6 10. Ba4 {Now b5 would be a mistake due to Nxb5 axb5 Bxb5  followed by d5 when  white wins the c6 knight. This idea of keeping a pin is present in lots of openinggs such as the semi slav. } Kf8 { Trying to get out of the pin but paying a high price. Now white gets lots of compensation for the pawn and should have the superior game. Though really white's threat of d5 is very hard to face here and this was probably the best move. } 11. Bxc6 bxc6 12. Qd3 {Eyeing the center pawns and breaking the annoying pin. } Bg6 {Black correctly decides to reposition the light bishop which after the knight moved wouldn't do anything. } 13. Qc4 {A surprising move. Black can not defend the c6 pawn so white will reestablish material equality. ( note after Ne7 or a queen move nxg5 ) Also, the queen eyes the f7 pawn. } h5 {Trying to activate his locked in h8 rook. Amazingly, black could really not do anything constructive before this so this move was practically forced. } 14. h4 {Stopping the pawn advance and creating a nice home on g5 for the knight. } g4 15. Ng5 {! A move that caught the black off guard. After f6?? "trapping the knight" Ne6  wins the queen. This means that black will have to move his king and queen play f6, and then play f6xg5 to win the knight. These four moves will give white a dangerous attack. } Ne7 {Finally developing. } 16. Bxf4 {Now white wins back his pawn and has the much superior game due to the lead in development, doubled black pawns, and better center control. White only has to be careful that his knight doesn't get rounded up too soon, meaning white has to play energetically. } d5 {?! This Opens up the center when black isn't ready. Probably Bh6 intending Kg7 is better. } 17. exd5 cxd5 18. Qc5 {A powerful move that protects the d pawn and pins the e7 knight. } Kg8 {Intending Nf5 with pressure against d4. } 19. Bxc7 {White wins a pawn.} Qd7 20. Rae1 {Safer was Be5 when the knight is hard to trap. } Nf5 21. Be5 f6 {Black wins a piece but gets snared in a dangerous attack. } 22. Nxd5 fxe5 23. dxe5 Bf8 24. Qc4 {Now best is Kg7 when white is still much better due to the past pawn but black makes a time trouble error. } Rc8 25. Ne7+ Kg7 26. Nxc8 Bc5+ 27. Qxc5 Rxc8 28. e6 Qb7 29. Qe5+ Kg8 30. Rxf5 Bxf5 31. Qxf5 {Now the threat of Qf7 wins the game. Black resigns. }
