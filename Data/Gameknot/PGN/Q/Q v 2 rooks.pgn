1. Nf3 {Hi everyone!  Jim Friar got some revenge over me for publishing his loss against Delta the Master Blaster.  Sadly I was unable to match Delta's stellar performance but I thought this game would be worthy of annotation because it can throw up a thread of which is better.  Q or 2 rooks.  In this game the Wicked Witch of the West won hands down!  She was aided by a very rampant steed though.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here to help you follow this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15882901&fb=1&rnd=0.3066320580432481.  Jim starts off the game with 1. Nf3 which is the Reti Opening which is rich in flexibility and options.} Nf6 2. b3 g6 3. Bb2 Bg7 {3. .... Bg7 - Fou Lenoir and Jim's dsb oppose each other on the h8-a1 diagonal.} 4. g4 {4. g4 - hmm, a pawn advance before developing his pieces - this is the sort of thing The Master Mater would do.  He wants to create a pawn wedge on g5.} d6 5. g5 Nh5 6. Bxg7 Nxg7 {6. .... Ng7 - bishop trade and if the knight on g7 has to move away and if Henry chooses to go kingside then Henry will start feeling chilly and Glenda had better get those knitting needles out quick!} 7. Qc1 {7. Qc1 - reinforcing that g5 footman should the d pawn advance. } e5 8. Qb2 O-O {8. ..... 0-0 - Henry goes kingside but is it the right choice?} 9. d3 Nc6 10. Nbd2 f5 11. h4 Qe7 {11. ..... Qe7 - starting to clear the decks.} 12. Bg2 e4 13. Nd4 Nxd4 14. Qxd4 {14. Qxd4 - knight trade.} exd3 15. Qxd3 {15. Qxd3 - pawn trade.} c6 16. Bf3 d5 {16. .... d5 - blocking off the g8-a2 diagonal.} 17. h5 Ne6 {17. .... Ne6 - now my knight must move, but never fear, Henry, your beloved, put upon, better half, Glenda is near! So are those black, woollen, medieval stockings!} 18. hxg6 hxg6 {18. ..... hxg6 - another pawn trade and the h file is opened.  I would just lurve to put Henry onto g7 but, alas, that diagonal is also available to the Wicked Witch of the West so Glenda goes onto it next turn instead.} 19. O-O-O Qg7 20. Nb1 {20. Nb1 - that knight is really innocuous but that is the one that will be the death of Henry later on.} Nxg5 21. Rdg1 Nxf3 22. Qxf3 {22. Qxf3 - after the N for B trade I am a pawn up.  Can I get away with this pawn grabbing though?} Be6 {22. ..... Be6 - finally I clear the decks.  However, Fou Leblanc becomes really Fou later on!} 23. Qf4 Rac8 24. Rh6 Kf7 25. Rhxg6 Qxg6 26. Rxg6 Kxg6 {26. ..... Kxg6 - Glenda is traded off for two rooks and a pawn.  This leaves me one point up in material but there is big trouble ahead.  I am very weak on the dark squares and the downside is - rooks do not move diagonally so they cannot do very much, even collectively.} 27. Nd2 Rfg8 28. Nf3 Kf6 {28. ..... Kf6 - my first real mistake.  Henry should have gone to f7 and not this square according to gameknot analysis.} 29. Qh4+ Kf7 30. Ne5+ {30. Ne5+ - in commeth that rampant steed!} Ke8 31. Qf6 Rg1+ 32. Kd2 Bg8 {32. ..... Bg8 - temporarily holds the position, but .....} 33. Nf3 Rh1 34. Qg7 Bf7 {34. .... Bf7 - again holding on to material but this will not work.} 35. Ng5 Rc7 {35. .... Rc7 - another defensive try but the Wicked Witch does not take no for an answer!} 36. Qe5+ Re7 37. Qb8+ Kd7 38. Qxb7+ Ke8 {38. ...... Ke8 - I could see that I was gonna cop Old Matey next turn if I played this move.  However, I analysed the alternatives and knew that I would be faced with ruinous loss of material.  Gameknot Analysis confirmed that I would have been the equivalent of a Q down with the alternative it suggested so I did save myself some the bother of typing out a resignation note and gave Jim the satisfaction of putting me in checkmate.  Have any of you been faced with Q v 2 rooks and what was the outcome?  I will now start that thread .....} 39. Qc8# {}
