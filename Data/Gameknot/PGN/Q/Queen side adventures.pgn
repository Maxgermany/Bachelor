1. d4 {This game had a Benoni-like setup and a queen side overload for white, which ultimately led to victory.} c5 2. d5 e6 3. c4 exd5 4. cxd5 g6 {Black plans to fianchetto} 5. e4 Bg7 6. Nc3 d6 7. Nf3 Nf6 8. h3 {I also considered Bd3, but I think I made the correct choice} Qa5 {This was the fatal move for black as his queen becomes a target and he is forced to retreat.} 9. Bd2 Qc7 10. Qa4+ {I think this was the correct move even with Bd7 looming because of the following sequence...} Bd7 {as expected...} 11. Nb5 {Instead of Bb5, this serves better to attack.  Black might should have moved Nbd7 on the move prior.} Qb6 {retreating to d8 was better, now the queen is definitely lost.} 12. Ba5 Bxb5 13. Bxb5+ Qxb5 14. Qxb5+ {White's material advantage is overwhelming, not to mention white is attacking fiercely.} Nbd7 15. Bc3 {Just to deter Nxe5} b6 {I was expecting a castle, but fine none-the-less.} 16. e5 {After a long wait, I made this move, and immediately thought it was a mistake.  It worked out, but I now think it was a mistake.} dxe5 17. Nxe5 {See it worked.} Rd8 18. O-O-O {and black resigns}
