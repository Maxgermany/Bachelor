1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 {White has opened with the English; Black plays a modern Indian-style response. White will now seek to occupy the center with pawns, while Black develops around them and prepares for a central pawn break.} 4. d4 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 {With the center happily occupied, White continues natural development and prepares for castling. Meanwhile, Black is ready to make a play for the center himself with ...e5.} e5 7. Be3 Ng4 8. Bg5 Qd7 {This is where we leave the GK database, or just about. There's one game with this line, which continues 9.h3 Nf6 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qc2, although the GK engine prefers 9.d5 Na6 10.O-O Qe8, though I think that's a bit overly passive.} 9. h3 Nf6 10. Qc2 {10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd7 is more accurate. The text allows 10...exd4 11.Nxd4 Re8, where I think Black has a very slight advantage.} Nc6 11. dxe5 Nxe5 12. O-O-O {White castles to the dangerous side, putting his king in the sights of the Black Bg7. For now, though, there's no real danger, and the benefits of the White Rook on the d-file could be significant.} Qc6 {The GK engine prefers Black to focus on the e-file with 12...Nxf3 13.Bxf3 Qe6, but I think this is okay. Black pressures c4 instead, and considers a direct queenside assault to take advantage of the White King's position.} 13. Kb1 {The GK engine considers this a mistake, but I don't really see it. Apparently 13...Nxf3 14.Bxf6 Bxf6 15.Nd5 Bd8 16.Bxf3 is strong for Black, but I was expecting 13...Nxc4 14.Nd4 Qc5 15.Bf4 with an attempt to trap the BQ somewhere on the horizon (as it happens, the GameKnot engine assumes this line as well, but considers it slightly advantageous for Black).} Nxc4 14. Nd4 Qc5 15. Bf4 Ne5 16. f3 {Stepping out of the way of the Queen while reinforcing e4, with the added bonus of opening up f2 as a station for the Bishop.} Nh5 {Pushing the Bishop back, but it was headed back anyway, with no prospects on f4. Probably Black should have preferring finishing his development with ...Bd7 and an eventual ...Rae8.} 17. Be3 {The BQ's avenues of escape are actually very limited, despite not being in direct danger yet--thanks to White's active Knights and well-placed Bishops. The Queen can get out, though, with 17...Nc4! freeing e5 for the Queen.} Qb4 {? Black's first mistake, though I can't blame him at all. The lines are really difficult to see here; I won't try to write them all out but Black's Queen is, in fact, trapped now. Correct was 17...Nc4, as I mentioned above. All the next moves are terrifically complex, each move wholly different from the last. I strongly suggest you look carefully at each of the next several positions, focusing on White's threats to trap the Black Queen--there are rather a lot of false trails and traps; the positions are really interesting.} 18. a3 {? Not great, but still enough to win. The Queen can escape now, at the cost of the Knight: 18...Qc5 19.b4 Nc4 (threatening ...Nxa3+, getting the Queen back) 20.Qa2 Nxa3+ 21.Qxa3 Qe5.} Qb6 {? As I mentioned, 18...Qc5 was the only way to stay in it. Now the Queen falls again!} 19. Nf5 {? But White misses the correct move again! Amidst the sea of possibilities there was 19.Na4! which wins the Queen outright. Now, Black has a chance to escape.} c5 {Of course not 19...Qc6?? 20.Ne7+, winning the Queen.} 20. Rxd6 {White picks up the pawn he sacrificed all those moves ago with interest. The GK computer gives White an advantage of nearly a full minor piece here.} Qc7 {The only good move. Now after 21.Nd5 Qb8, the Queen is safe, though after 22.Nxg7 Nxg7 23.Qxc5 White is still looking invincible.} 21. Nd5 Qa5 {?? The final mistake. Refusing to put his Queen in quarantine on b8, Black misses the trap and this time, White follows through correctly.} 22. Nfe7+ {No point in losing the Knight (though GK prefers 22.Nxg7, and I tend to agree since now White will have a concrete material advantage and reducing towards the endgame will favor him.} Kh8 23. Bd2 {1-0. With nowhere else for his Queen to run, Black resigns in the face of overwhelming material loss (23...Qd8 24.Rxd8 Rxd8 25.Qxc5 is easily enough to prove decisive). Many thanks to hinschi for a fantastic game! I hope some of you enjoyed reading it; especially the last six moves or so. Comments are appreciated; thanks for reading!}
