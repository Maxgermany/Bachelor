[Opening "Alapin's opening (C20)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Ne2 {This is the Alapin Opening which is an alternative to Nf3. The knight develops so as to prevent the Bg4 pin and allowing f4.} Nf6 {Attacking the e4 pawn} 3. d4 {Aggresive move striking the hold that Black has on the center} Nxe4 {Taking the free pawn} 4. Ng3 {? Trades off knights but doubling his pawns} Nxg3 5. hxg3 Nc6 {Defends his e5 pawn and attacks the d4 pawn.} 6. Nc3 {? Again, this invites Black to kill the d4 pawn with a gain of tempo.} exd4 7. Nd5 {White is in trouble here, 2 pawns down after only 7 moves.} Be7 {Simple development and the bishop can be captured.} 8. Qg4 {Attacking the unguarded g7 square} g6 {Defends agains this... even better is 8.O-O 9.Bh6 Bf6 then all is covered (thanks nuntar for the comment)   } 9. Bc4 {Eyeing the f7 square} f5 {Opens up his position while he is behind in development, unwise.} 10. Rxh7 {Sacrifices his rook here. If 10.Rxh7 11.Qxg6+ Kf8 12.Nf6 Rg7 13.Nh7+ Rxh7 14. Qg8++} fxg4 {Takes the bait...} 11. Nxc7+ {Check and unleashing the bishop} Qxc7 12. Bf7+ Kd8 {If 12.Kf8, 13.Bf6 ++} 13. Rxh8+ {Closing in on the Black King. } Bf8 {Forced} 14. Bg5+ Ne7 {Forced} 15. Rxf8# {The end....perhaps Black should have played d6 earlier and focused more on development before playing f5.  Hope you enjoyed it.}
