[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {As White, I've always preferred the closed and semi-closed openings. Closed openings start with 1. d4 d5. Semi-closed ones start with 1.d4 and black responds with some move other than 1. ... d5. The Open Game is 1.e4 e5, a Semi-Open Game is 1.e4 where black makes moves other than 1...e5. Flank openings 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4 can easily transpose into closed or semi-closed (or sometimes open or semi-open). Also, 1. d4 d5 can easily transpose into various openings such as the Slav Defense, Chigorin Defense, Albin Counter Gambit, Baltic Defense, etc., if black later plays d5.} d5 {And so we have a closed game.} 2. Nf3 Nf6 {So we both bring our knights to c3 and c6. This is good. **************************************************************  Generally, the knights belong on c3, c6, f3 and f6 on their 1st developing move. The primary reason for this is, each knight controls 2 of the 4 central squares: d4, d5, e4 and e5. I will speak more on controlling these crucial squares on White's move 7. ****************************************************************  The 2nd reason knights should be placed on these squares is that you don't know yet where they will be needed. Let's say later in the game, you need your king's knight to help defend your queen side. The knight would get there faster from f6 than he would if you had played him to h6. If you wanted that knight to assist in an attack on my king, he would be on the job faster from f6, than from e7. The same principle applies to all 4 of those knight locations. ****************************************************************  The third reason is, a knight on f3 controls e1, d2, d4, e5, g5, g1 and h4; six squares. You usually want to place your pieces where they control as many squares as possible. A knight on e2 also controls 6 squares, c1, c3, d5, f5, g3 and g1. A knight on h3 controls g5, f4, f2 and g1; only 4 squares, thus an edge of the board knight is usually weaker than a knight in the center. A knight on f3 and e2 both control 6 squares, but the one on f3 is usually stronger due to the 1st two reasons above.  ***************************************************************  There are exceptions to every rule though. The squares c3, c6, f3 & f6 are the ultimate starting locations for knights, but depending on the position, d2, e2, d7 & e7 can be best, and on rare occasions, a3, a6, h3 & h6 are the best places to put a knight. When the latter is the case, it is usually just to relocate it to another place. ****************************************************************  Key Principle: Develop towards the center! Develop knights primarily to c3, c6, f3 & f6.} 3. c4 {So here we transpose into a QG (Queens Gambit), whether declined or accepted depends on you. In the QG, White offers Black a "free" pawn in an attempt to draw Black's d pawn away from controlling the center. If Black accepts, White has many resources to use to get the pawn back, one of which is the simple Qa4+, followed by Qxc4. Black cannot hold the pawn. ******************************************************************  It is generally accepted that it is safe to take the pawn as long as you don't try to hold on to it. On the other hand, I personally don't accept the QG pawn when I play Black. To take would mean moving my pawn away from the center to take a pawn that I cannot hold. Better to keep developing and supporting the center as you did with 3. ...c6, or with various other means. ******************************************************************  That is only a personal opinion, though, since many masters accept the pawn. If you choose to accept the pawn, that's fine. Then you need to learn the various lines of play where black accepts the pawn. ******************************************************************  Key Principle: When and if you accept a pawn gambit, be careful about trying to hold the pawn. I'm not saying never try to hold a gambit pawn. Sometimes depending on the position, you  should keep the pawn. I am only saying be careful.  ******************************************************************  In the case of playing black against the Queens Gambit, don't try to hold the pawn or don't accept it at all.} c6 {QG Declined / Slav Defense. With this move Black threatens to accept the pawn, then support c4 with the pawn thrust to b5. I still was not concerned as Black gives up the center control and I still have other resources to harass his queenside pawns, and potentially gain the pawn back, such as e3, followed by a4. If bxa4, then his pawn structure is terrible. I would then have no trouble winning the 2 pawns back!} 4. Nc3 {I continue to add pressure to d5, not concerned about 4. ...dxc4 and 5. ...b5 to protect the pawn on c4, because of the reasons stated on Black's previous move.} Bf5 {He who controls the center the best, controls the opening!  ******************************************************************  So we both are doing a good job of controlling the center. In the opening it is crucial to occupy and / or control the primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5. Secondarily, it is also important to do the same to the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. Lastly, it is good to control any squares on the board you deem important, based on the position. ******************************************************************  You have a pawn occupying d5, the c pawn controlling d5, a knight controlling d5 & e4, a bishop controlling e4 and the queen bearing down on d5. I have a pawn occupying d4, the c pawn controlling d5, the knights controlling the 4 primary squares and a queen honing in on d4. ******************************************************************   So thus far, we both have a lot of control of the center, but I have a little more than you do, since you have no occupation or control of d4 or e5. My extra control is not a major thing as of yet, but it is something you should be looking to work on. For example, you may want to consider Nb8d7 and Qc7 both to control e5. ******************************************************************   This type of analysis should be frequent throughout every game, especially in the opening! ******************************************************************   Key Principle: Contend to control the center of the board!} 5. Qb3 {5.Qb3 to defend the d4 pawn, attack the undefended b7 pawn and apply more pressure to the d5 pawn.  Be careful when bringing your queen out early, as she can be subject to attack, causing you to lose development. I will speak more on this on move 7 for black and white. I chose to bring my queen out early here because she can't be attacked easily on this square (exception being 6. ...dxc4 7.Qxc4, or 6.Qb6 as you  played, no problem). ******************************************************************  Key Principle: Only bring your queen out early if she can't easily be chased around the board!} Qb6 {So you offer me a queen trade, which would give you the disadvantage of doubled pawns and the advantage of an opened file for your queen side rook. ************************************************************** Doubled pawns are a disadvantage because they are harder to work with later in the game, when you want to break through to get a passed pawn. Isolated doubled pawns are worse, because they are also harder to work with to promote them, but more than that, they can`t defend each other. Therefore they are easier for your opponent to attack and take them.  ***************************************************************  Rooks need open files to reach their full potential. Most frequently, files are opened in the middle (among other reasons, because the central pawns on the c, d, e & f files are the most frequently traded) and the rooks move there to gain their mobility. Yet an open a-file would be ideal as the queen rook automatically is on an open file. *************************************************************** Since the queen trade would not result in isolated doubled pawns, I felt your advantage of the opened file would be greater than your disadvantage of doubled pawns. I'd rather you took my queen, giving me the open rook file (and the doubled pawns). Thus my next move, c5 to attack the queen.} 6. c5 {Now you have to trade queens on my terms or move your queen off of the b file.} Qc7 {This is the only reasonable square to move to (apart from trading queens) as you need to defend the b pawn. The move 6. ...Qa6 would open you up to 7.e4 attacking the Queen and the LSB. You probably saw that though since you did not play 6. ...Qa6. :-)} 7. Bf4 {7.Bf4! So, I sacrifice my Bishop, knowing that if you take him, I take your b pawn, then your rook! If you don't take my bishop, you have to move your queen, thus losing even more development. You already moved her twice. ******************************************************************  Mohsen, let me make up an imaginary scene, then relate it to chess. Imagine twins, Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack set aside $10,000 in the year 2010 and invested it at a certain interest rate, say for example 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be $304,094.20. Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040, and sets aside $10,000 and invests it at the same interest rate, 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be only $13,673.60. ******************************************************************  What is interesting about this scenario, is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates, Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack! You may ask, "Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!" ******************************************************************  One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square, to a more active location) as quickly as possible. If you don't, you may find yourself behind in development. It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative, similar to Jake in the illustration, you're far less likely to be able to catch up! One way to get a lead in development is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop your queen, then I develop my bishop to attack her, forcing you to move her a 2nd time, I gain a "tempo", and you lose a tempo. One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely play QNd7 right now, for example. You'd lose your Queen! ******************************************************************  Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move, he hinders you from doing what you may have planned, (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan). If he forces you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! ******************************************************************  Key Principle: Be careful Mohsen, not to allow your opponent to gain tempo, and therefore development, faster than you do.  } Qc8 {So now Mohsen, You have moved your Queen 3 times. Take a look at your other pieces, compared to mine. ******************************************************************  You have a knight, bishop, 2 pawns and your queen developed. The only material you have intentionally placed are the knight, bishop and pawns. Your queen was intentionally placed on b6, then she moved back to c7 and c8 where I chased her. It is good to force your opponents hand! As I said, if I force you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! ******************************************************************  I, on the other hand, have a bishop, 2 knights, 2 pawns and my queen not only developed, but sitting where I intended them to be. ******************************************************************  Furthermore, I have 7 development moves, you only have 5! White goes first, so if all things remain equal, white makes 1 development move, then black makes 1 development move, white makes a 2nd development move, then black makes a 2nd development move, and so on. Therefore black is always 1/2 development move behind. The battle in the opening is to tilt the scales in your favor (whether black or white). You want to force your opponent to lose development or tempo, by attacking more valuable pieces with less valuable material. ******************************************************************  A 2nd way to force initiative in development is to develop a piece with check. The king moves, (for example to d1 or d2 on the open d file), so you queen side castle, putting the king in check again. You have developed your bishop, your king to safety and brought your rook to an open file. All your opponent has done is move his king around. Good for you! } 8. e3 {Preparing to continue my development.} e6 { Preparing to continue your development. You need to try to catch up!} 9. Be2 {Now I have my queen and minor pieces off of the back rank. I only need to activate my rooks. You still have a queen, bishop, knight and both rooks undeveloped!} Be7 { } 10. Nh4 {I normally prefer my bishops over knights. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. So, you have to consider each game individually, but generally, as pieces get traded off, closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up, the bishops become stronger and stronger. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. That may be just a personal thing though, because while most strong chess players agree with me, I've met some who disagree. So here I attack your bishop and trade. Then I will have 2 bishops against a knight in the endgame. ******************************************************************  Also, the trade gives you doubled pawns, which can be compensated for by the fact that you also will have an opened file. Earlier in the game, I stated that the opened file was more of an issue than the doubled pawns. In this case, I feel the opposite because, while you have an opened h file to attack my king, the DSB (Dark Square Bishop) would help cover h2.  ******************************************************************  In addition, if you castle on the king side, your rook goes to f8 off of the open file. If you choose queen side castling, you have a good deal of maneuvering required, seeing how I attack your b pawn with my queen, and my DSB is on the h2-b8 diagonal. To queen side castle, you need to move your queen off the back rank. Her only square to go to is d7, which should be reserved for the queen side knight. } Bg6 { } 11. Nxg6 {Now I will have 2 bishops against a knight and bishop. I rub my hands together.} fxg6 {Mohsen, it is usually best for pawns to capture toward the center of the board. It gets back to controlling those primary center squares, d4, e4, d5 and e5, and secondarily the 12 squares surrounding those 4, being c3, c4, c5, c6, d3, d6, e3, e6, f3, f4, f5 and f6. ******************************************************************  Capturing as you did leaves the e6 pawn weak and less protected. You want to keep all of your pawns strong, but especially the pawns within these crucial areas. The e6 square is within that secondary range. ******************************************************************  This move also weakens your kings position as the a2-g8 diagonal is more vulnerable to be attacked. This (in conjunction with 15. ... e5) gave me space to make the combination: 18.Nxd5 cxd5 19.Qxd5+. Qxd5 would not be check if you had captured via 11. ... hxg6. Since it would not be check, the combination would not work, because when I play 19.Qxd5, then you protect the bishop with 19. ... b6. ******************************************************************  Key Principle: Make Pawn Captures Toward the Center of the Board!} 12. O-O { } O-O {The stage is being set! You made a very natural move, castling king-side. Yet, in the process, you put your king on the same diagonal as my queen. You are not yet in trouble, but the stage is being set!} 13. h3 {Suspecting you may play Nh5, I wanted to give my bishop a retreat square. If after Nh5, I play BxN, I still give up a bishop for a knight. I wasn't interested.} Nbd7 { } 14. Rac1 {I played this move not only to bring the rook to a more central square (since there are no open files to put the rook on), but I also did it in preparation for your 15. ...e5. I was not sure you would make that move, but just in case, I needed extra support on the c5 pawn, so after the exchanges on d5, I can play Qxd5 followed by QxB or RxB (on c5).  Aside from that, if there are no open files, it is good generally to bring rooks to one of the 4 center files (c, d, e or f). This is because the pawns on those files are the ones most likely to be traded. } Nh5 {14. ...Nh5? Be very careful about putting your knights on the side of the board. There are certainly exceptions, but generally, when you put a knight in this position, it should be to trade it off (as I did), or make a forking attack, or serious threat, or to get to another more active position.  ******************************************************************  In this example though, you may have done it with an intention to trade off my bishop, but I, not wanting to trade had an escape square. The knight has no attack or threat and there are no active squares he can move to, (with exception of f6, where the knight just came from. That wastes time and hurts your development). To make things worse, you helped me to shut your knight in further by trading on the e5 square (15... e5). This trading left me with a pawn on e5 cutting off your knights only escape route (f6). So the knight was forever stuck on the side until I attacked him (24.g4) and you resigned.} 15. Bh2 { } e5 {15... e5? After the exchange on the e5 square, I will have a pawn there, attacking f6. Notice that f6 was the only square your knight had to retreat to. So 16.Bxe5 Nxe5 17.dxe5, and your knight is forever trapped. I knew the knight would never get back into the game, since you can't move your pawn on g7 as it is blocked by the pawn on g6. You can't move the pawn on g6 (to make space to move the pawn on g7) because I would play BxN. So the only way to make space for the knight would be to win the pawn on e5, before I play g4, but I have a enough to defend the pawn. You don't have enough fire power to win it. I delayed the g4 move since I felt the knight was dead anyway. He could neither attack me nor help defend you. ******************************************************************  Also, this move 15... e5 removes protection from the pawn on d5, which helped me with a later combination, beginning with 18.Nxd5.} 16. Bxe5 {This capture enables you to get a bishop for a knight, which is good for you. But I went for it to get the pawn on e5, to block in your dead knight. There are also the other reasons pointed out in the annotation on 15...e5.} Nxe5 { } 17. dxe5 {With this move, your knights fate is sealed. Imprisoned forever!} Bxc5 {17. ... Bxc5? You've taken the poison pawn! This is bad for you because we have my queen and your king on the same diagonal. So after Bxc5, I play 18.Nxd5, with a discovered attack on your bishop! If you take back, (defending the bishop with your queen) I play QxP+. I give up my knight and win the 2 pawns, knowing I will the piece back when I take the bishop with my rook or queen. You could have played 17. ...Kh8 to avoid the ensuing combination.   Key Principle: Be very careful about allowing forking checks and discovered attacks.} 18. Nxd5 { } cxd5 { } 19. Qxd5+ {I am considering now the following lines of play: 19. … Kh8 20. Rxc5 (gaining development as you move your king, then I attack your queen with my rook, to get even further development. Seeking to gain development is not only an opening theme, it flows throughout the whole game!) or 19. … Rf7 20. Rxc5 Qf8 21. Bc4 Re8 22. Rc7 Ree7 23. Rxe7 Qxe7 24. Qxf7+ Qxf7 25. Bxf7+ Kxf7 26. g4 or 19. Qxd5+ Rf7 20. Rxc5 Qf8 21. Rc7 Rd8 22. Qb3 b5 23. Rd1 Rxd1+ 24. Bxd1 a6 25. Qxf7+ Qxf7 26. Rc8+ Qf8 27. Bb3+ Kh8 28. Rxf8# or 19. Qxd5+ Rf7 20. Rxc5 Qf8 21. Rc7 Rd8 22. Qb3 b5 23. Rd1 Rxd1+ 24. Bxd1 a6 25.	Qxf7+ Qxf7 26.	 Rc8+ Qe8 27. Rxe8+ Kf7 28.	Ra8 Ke6 29. g4!} Kh8 20. Rxc5 {Again, as I mentioned earlier, I take with the rook instead of the queen to force you to move her. Taking with the queen in an attempt to trade queens would not be bad either. See my next note on 20. ...Qd8 for the reason.} Qd8 {You are behind in material,so it's not in your best interest to trade. I have 7 pawns to your 5, a 2 pawn lead. I have a strong bishop and you have a dead knight, so for all practical purposes, a bishop lead. Yet in order to win the knight after g4, I have to give up a pawn (Pxh5 and you play Pxh5), reducing my pawn lead to 1.  So if we continue trading, then after everything is traded off, I will still have a pawn and bishop. I would use the king and bishop to help advance the pawn to become a  queen. Key Principle: Avoid trades when you are behind in material!} 21. Qxd8 {So we trade queens, and from this point on, I simply offer another trade, which you willfully accept, then I play g4 to attack the trapped horse.} Raxd8 { } 22. Rd1 {Again I am trying to trade off all equal material.} Rxd1+ { } 23. Bxd1 {So the material on the board is dwindling down!} h6 { } 24. g4 {You resigned, seeing your horse was trapped in his stable. Thanks for the game Mohsen, I hope this was a lot of help!}
