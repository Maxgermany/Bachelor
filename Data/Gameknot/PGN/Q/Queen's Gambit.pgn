1. d4 {Usual opening. Followed by 2.c4 and 3.Nc3} d5 2. c4 dxc4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e4 e6 {At this point, i can see that my opponent is going to play 5.. Bb4, pinning my knight, and then following with 6.. Ne4, which wouldn't be good for me. So, I thought about it and i can prevent it all by playing 6. Qa4 , checking the king and threatening the bishop. But a good retort from him would be 6.. Nc6, blocking the check and protecting the Bishop. So, to prevent that, i have to attack the c6 square} 5. d5 exd5 6. exd5 Bb4 {Just as i expected. my opponent will be in a situation that even if the Nc6 move was made, my opponent would lose either a horse or a bishop} 7. Qa4+ c6 8. Qxb4 Nxd5 9. Qxc4 Qf6 {At this point, i could see that i'm in trouble. My opponent has an open game where my kingside is totally under-developed. I had to start developing my pieces.} 10. Nf3 O-O 11. Bg5 Qe6+ 12. Be2 Re8 {At this point, I saw a mating opportunity. All i need to do is castle and get my a1 rook to e1. If he sacreifices the queen to save mate, at least i've won the queen. If not, then its mate. Plus, my queen is already attacking kingside, and you black square bishop is positioned perfectly for a mate ooportuniy later down the track.} 13. O-O Nxc3 14. bxc3 Qxe2 {Its a pity this happened. By moving my rook to e1 square, black would lose a queen and a rook for 2 rooks.} 15. Rae1 Qxe1 16. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 17. Nxe1 {Now, all i need to do is try to get my queen on the 8th row} Na6 18. h3 {Allowing my king for escape (just in case) and preventing the bishop from entering my side} Be6 19. Qe2 f6 {19. f6 (???????) I don't know why my opponent did this, but this was the point where mate was imminent. I seized this opportunity} 20. Qxe6+ Kf8 {Now, all i needed to do was to bet the bishop on d6 (Bd6). It will take 2 moves, which was risky cos the knight and rook can come into the action. However, if the rook decides to come in with Re1, then i win the game. But if the knight comes in and threatens my queen, then it will be problematic, but i would just fork with Qd6.} 21. Bf4 Re8 {21.. Re8. Bad move, this was the turning point of the game. What my opponent doesn't realise is that by doing that, it would be either mate in 2 or 3.} 22. Bd6+ {My opponent resigned. This was a rather enjoyable game because i could see the mating opportunity early and try to capitalise. However, my opponent could've made a better escape route for himself on the kingside. Nevertheless, it was a very enjoyable game and hope you all enjoyed it too!}
