1. e4 {Here is another quick win! Ended in 20 minutes! Anyways, as always, I play the e4 opening.} e5 {Standard response.} 2. Nf3 {Sometimes I play the Ruy Lopez, but here I am aiming for a 4 knights game.} f6 {Huge mistake! This opens the floodgates.} 3. Nxe5 {But first i need to get the knight out of the way. And not only did I manage to get it out of the way, but now I have made it possible to launch an attack. Now don't misinterprete, I never!!! attack early. But it was a game for fun, and I decided to try to attack his weakness.} fxe5 4. Qh5+ {Now this move forces him to do one of two things. Either play g6, and Qxe5 claims the rook, or he can move his king forward. Personally, I would prefer to keep material where possible, and I would move ke7.} Ke7 5. Qxe5+ {Now I am going to force him all over the board. This is similar to another one of my annotations, but this one requires more work.} Kf7 {...} 6. Bc4+ {Now the bishop comes out, forcing him to move to g6, he is now defenseless, with no developed pieces.} Kg6 {...} 7. Qf5+ {Now, had I played d4 before this it would be a checkmate. But I saw a semi-forced checkmate, and I didn't want to give him a free move to improve his position. So force him there, then put him in check again.} Kh6 {...} 8. d4+ {Take more centre control in case my attack fails, while putting him in a revealed check. He could always play Qg5, but then Qxg5 is a checkmate. His only viable option is g5.} g5 {As I said, his only option...} 9. h4 {Now I am challenging the pawn. Here I hope he tries to protect the pawn, so that the revealed check with the rook would send him into disarray, and a possible checkmate.} Be7 {He falls for it, not seeing the revealed check. There is now a forced checkmate in 2. } 10. hxg5+ {His only legal option is kg7, and I can mate him in this position.} Kg7 11. Qf7# {Here the bishop protects the king. Another fast checkmate. Let me know what you think.}
