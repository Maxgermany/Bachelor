1. e4 {In this game I'm particularly happy about the end of the game. } c5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 e5 5. d3 d6 6. h3 Be7 7. Ne2 O-O 8. Ng3 h6 9. a3 Be6 10. Bb5 {? 10.Bb5? Qa5  11.Bd2 Qxb5 and I will be clearly ahead in this game...} Nd4 {?? And I overlooked this big opportunity :-)} 11. Nxd4 cxd4 12. b4 a6 13. Ba4 b5 {d5 would probably be better...} 14. Bb3 Bxb3 15. cxb3 d5 16. f3 Rc8 17. O-O Qd7 18. Nf5 Nh7 19. Bd2 Rc7 {Bg5 is maybe a better move for me} 20. Qe2 Rfc8 {And still I think Bg5 would be better for me...... } 21. g4 dxe4 {Bg5.... :-)} 22. fxe4 Rc7c2 23. Rac1 {And here we see a bit of the point of playing Bg5 earlier. By Bg5 I would have made pressure to the  c1-g5 diagonal and  possibly forced an exchange of bishops which in turn would have given me stronger control over the c-file and 2.rank} Bg5 {Finally! lol} 24. Rcd1 {I think Rxc2 would be better for white, but the game is more and less lost by now} Ra2 25. a4 Rcc2 26. Qf3 Bxd2 27. Kh1 {?} Bf4 28. Kg1 Ng5 {!} 29.
