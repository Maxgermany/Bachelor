1. e4 e6 {French!} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 b6 {This shocked me, I have never run into anybody else who plays that, is it a line of the French that I'm not familiar with?} 6. Bd3 {I played what I thought was best.} cxd4 7. cxd4 h6 8. O-O Nge7 9. Be3 {Be3?? Why did I play that, I'll let you answer that.} Nf5 10. Bb5 Bd7 11. Nc3 Bb4 12. Rc1 {To me it looked like Rc1 was forced.} a6 {I knew he was going to play that.} 13. Bxc6 Bxc6 14. Ne2 {Horrible move on my part.} Bb5 15. a3 {Sparta (pawn) vs. Athens (2 bishops)} Be7 16. a4 Bd7 17. b3 {b3 again another pointless move.} O-O 18.

Nxe4 {Slowly improving my position.} bxa4 27. bxa4 Qc6 {I don't think he can take that pawn, I think Nf6+ wins, but I did not see that so...} 28. Ra1 {...I played another useless move.} Qd5 29. h4 {A late attack.} Bc6 30. Rc1 {Stopping his threat.} Ba3 31. Rc2 Rd8 32. Ng3 {Tal knight.} Bxa4 {I think that was a mistake.} 33.
