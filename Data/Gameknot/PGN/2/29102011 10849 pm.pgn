1. d4 e6 2. e3 d5 3. Bd3 Bd6 4. f4 Nf6 5. Nd2 O-O 6. Ngf3 c5 7. c3 Nc6 8. O-O c4 9. Bc2 Ng4 {At this point, the engines suggest Bxh7, a classic sacrifice. } 10. Qe2 {However, I moved the queen to defend e3. Alternative variation: 10.Bxh7+ Kxh7 11.Ng5+ Kg8 12.Qxg4  [This variation wins the h7 pawn, but moves away from the spirit of the original game.]  12...Qf6 13.e4  } f5 {At this point, engines suggest Ne5, followed by knight exchange from black. } 11. h3 {I chose to shoo the knight away, but weakening g3, where the knight would love to come later. Alternative variation: 11.Ne5 Ngxe5 12.dxe5 Be7 13.b4  } Nf6 12. Ne5 Qa5 13. g4 fxg4 14. hxg4 Qb6 {engines would want me to attack the knight on f6 before moving the rook out. } 15. Rf2 {Alternative variation: 15.g5 Bxe5 16.dxe5 Ne8 17.Kg2 g6 18.b3  [Engines decide to try a queen side attack as well, in order to weaken the black pawn chain. I was not interested in that.]   } h6 {engines suggest attacking the rook and with Ng6, which is a natural attacking move and a lovely outpost. } 16. Rh2 {Alternative variation: 16.Ng6 Rf7 17.g5 Nh7 18.Qh5 Ne7 19.Nxe7+ Rxe7 20.gxh6 Nf8 21.Rg2 Qc7 22.Qg5  [However at this point the game moves into queen side attacks and a slower attacking pace.]   } Ne7 17. g5 hxg5 18. fxg5 Bxe5 19. dxe5 Nd7 {engines suggest now a beautiful move: Rh8, followed by a munching of black pieces or/and mate. Make sure you check out the variation. } 20. Nf3 {Alternative variation: 20.Rh8+ Kf7 ( 20...Kxh8  [Taking the rook leads to a quick mate.]  21.Qh5+ Kg8 22.Bh7+ Kh8 23.Bg6+ Kg8 24.Qh7# ) 21.Qh5+ g6 22.Bxg6+ Nxg6 23.Qh7+ Ke8 24.Qxg6+ Kd8 25.Rxf8+ Nxf8 26.Qf6+ Ke8 27.Nf3 [Try this variation on a chess engine to see it to the end. White is only one pawn up, but it is a passed one. The king is safe as well.]   } Rb8 21. g6 Nf5 22. Rh3 Nh6 23. Kh1 {I felt like the pin on e3 was annoying and stopping me from using the black bishop. The engines recommend moving Qh2 instead, which is much better. Alternative variation: 23.Qh2 Nc5 24.Ng5 Ne4 25.Bxe4 dxe4 26.Nh7 Qc7 ( 26...Rd8  [If you wanted to know why black did not move the rook when attacked by the knight, follow this variation through.] 27.Rxh6 Rd1+ 28.Kg2 Qd8 29.Nf6+ Kf8 30.Rh8+ Ke7 31.Qh4 Rd2+ 32.Bxd2 b6 33.a4 Qxd2+ 34.Kh1 Qe1+ 35.Rxe1 Bb7 36.Rxb8 Bc8 37.Rxc8  gxf6 38.Qh7# ) 27.Nxf8 Qd8 28.Rxh6 Qg5+ 29.Kf2 Qxh6 30.Qxh6 gxh6 31.Nh7  [At this point white is a knight up, but what a boring continuation.]   } Nf5 24. Qh2 Ng3+ {Engines suggest I move the king and concentrating on the attack, but I took the knight with the rook. } 25. Rxg3 {Alternative variation: 25.Kg1 Qxe3+ 26.Bxe3 Ne2+ 27.Kg2 Nf4+ 28.Bxf4 Rf5 29.Rh8#  } Re8 26. Qh7+ Kf8 27. e4 {At this point, a mate in 8 is found. } Qc7 {But with this move, mate will happen in 4. } 28. Bg5 Nf6 29. exf6 Rd8 30. Qh8# {}
