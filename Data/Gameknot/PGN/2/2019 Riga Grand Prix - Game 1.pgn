[White "Mamedyarov, Shakhriyar "]
[Black "Vachier-Lagrave, Maxime "]
[Opening "Gruenfeld (D85), modern exchange variation"]

1. d4 {At the time, I thought that this was the second most common opening since 1.e4 seemed to be the most.  Well, I was partly right, but 1.e4 and 1.d4 are a tie for the most popular openings, then something else, I guess the English Opening is the second most common.} Nf6 {I would've played 2...d5, but I like this move just as well since it develops.} 2. c4 {Of course, this is a very good and natural move since it advances the c pawn, which now makes it safe for white to play 3.Nc3 without blocking the pawn.  And, in fact, that's why Shakhriyar played it since he'll bring the Nb1 after Maxime finachetto's. } g6 3. Nc3 d5 {I would've played this earlier, so right on the second move.  As now, Shakhriyar will be able to exchange.  And, I think that this exchange favors him, as well.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 {This is why.  And, I'm not surprised to see Maxime exchange N's.  Personally, I would not here, but instead, would answer with 5...Nb6 as I don't see a reason to do it.  But, I know that there's got to be one.  I'm not sure what level they are, but even if it's not GM level, they're both, at least, experts.  } Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Qa4+ {I was not surprised to see Shakhriyar throw in a check.  But, I would've tried to punish it with 7...Bd7  But, seeing that Maxime doesn't play it, I know that it wouldn't have been a great move since black offers a Q exchange.  I'd see why he wants to do it as white's Q is more active.} Qd7 8. Qa3 {Having said that, Shakhriyar refuses.} b6 {And, Maxime does something that I wouldn't have done which is a double fianchetto.  I also see why ION doesn't do this, and combine with what Ken said, and I'm not surprised that black lost this game.  That doesn't mean that this was a mistake or inaccuracy, but rather, I don't like this move.  And, I believe that this is where black's game starts to fall apart, but it's impossible to say it for certain.  Afterall, given that they're strong players, what I know is that they see things that others don't see.} 9. Nf3 {And, with that Shakhriyar continues developing as does Maxime by completing his fianchetto.  In the aftermatch, both sides are now bound to castle after 10.Bd3.  } Bb7 10. Bd3 O-O 11. O-O c5 {Going for a pawn exchange, but Shakhriyar has other ideas first and completes his development before that happens.} 12. Bf4 cxd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 {And, with that, Maxime also completes his development, once and for all.} 14. d5 {And, Shakhriyar wastes no time in going on the offense.} Na5 15. Rac1 {Threatens to attack the Q, but I would've played 15.Bd2 which appears to win a pawn 16.Bxa5 bxa5 17.Qxa5  From that, I figured that there's something about 17.Qxa5 which won't be good.  I'm not sure what it is, but it's important to be careful with that kind of thing, as recently, Carlsen showed a game where his opponent had a win.  But, he got greedy and grabbed a piece which allowed Carlsen to stalemate his opponent.} Rfc8 {Having said that, I would've brought a R over, but I'd use the other R because 15...Rac8 would've allowed black to centralize one of his R's.} 16. h3 {I don't see the point behind this move because it's not possible for Maxime to play ...Ng4 or ...Bg4.  In addition, ...Qg4 doesn't pose as an immediate threat.  I know that it eventually would, but I would've played 16.e5 to allow 17.Bg5 without then getting attacked since e7 would be attacked a second time.} e6 {On the other hand, this is also what I would've played as black since Maxime doesn't like where Shakhriyar's pawn is placed.  I'd think the same way here since I have done damage in a similar position in one or two tournament games.} 17. d6 {And, with that, I also would've played this, as now Sharkhriar now has a passed pawn.} f6 {Maxime responds by trying to put pressure on white since this now threatens 18...e5 which is the real he played this.  But, Shakriyar will have none of that, and neither would I.} 18. e5 {As this is also what I would've played.  But, Maxime was ready and goes into a variation of exchanges.} Bxf3 19. exf6 Bxf6 20. gxf3 e5 {I'm not surprised to see Maxime become aggressive.} 21. Bd2 Rxc1 22. Rxc1 Rc8 {Maxime enjoys exchanges, but seeing that Shakhriyar does this rather then retreat to somewhere like f1, it's safe to say that this benefits white.} 23. Rxc8+ Qxc8 24. Kg2 {I don't see where the K would be useful until the endgame.  But, this is the late middle game.  So, there's got to something about the monarchs that I'm missing as Maxime will bring his out in a couple of moves.} Bd8 {I'm not sure why it was necessary to retreat since the B didn't seem to be attacked.  I would've gone after white's pawn with either 24...Qd7 or 24...Qc6.} 25. Be4 {I'm not sure why Shakhriyar moved his B here.  I would've played 25.Bb5 as it threatens 26.d7  My idea of a good time would be to do something powerful with my passed pawn.  In fact, that's why after watching Sasha's game against Joann where, in the end, Sasha sacked R for B, I did something similar for the same reason and it was giving up my R against Tom Walsh.  In doing so, the pawn was going to promote which Joann resigned, and I promoted the same way.  Not long after, Tom resigned.} Qe6 {And, with that, I'm not surprised that Maxime is attempting to stop Shakriyar's passer, but white's got an answer to that with his next move.} 26. Qd3 Kg7 {As noted a couple of moves back, Maxime brings his K into the action.} 27. Bc3 {And, Shakhriyar goes right after e5.} Qf6 {And, Maxime protects with his Q.  I would've used the B, as I like the placement of the B after 27...Bf6  But, given that black didn't play it there's something about it that doesn't work.  Either way, while it's not obvious since material is even black is lost.  Well, I know that just because, material wise, something's level, doesn't mean that it's even.  And, that's the case here.  That, however, gives me the impression that no one made any mistakes.} 28. Kf1 {Maxime, however, resigned here.  I'm not sure exactly, but I, originally, thought that it was because white can win a pawn starting with 29.Qd5  But, given that Shakriyar played 28.Kf1 makes there's a reason that more powerful.  And, with that white outplayed black, nonetheless.}
