1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {I think this is premature and that White should have transposed his second and third moves.  Had he played 2 Nf3, I would have played 2...d6 when 3 Bc4 would be a decent move.} e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Bb5+ Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Nxd7 6. exd5 exd5 7. Qe2+ Qe7 8. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {Black seems to have already equalized.} 9. O-O Bd6 {With the Bishop on e7, Re1 could be awkward.} 10. Re1+ Ne7 11. d4 O-O 12. dxc5 Bxc5 13. Be3 Nc6 14. Nc3 d4 15. Ne4 {?? First blunder, White would be OK after 15 Red1} dxe3 16. fxe3 Bb6 17. Nd6 Rab8 18. c3 Nf6 {18... Nde5 may be better.} 19. Nc4 Rbd8 20. Nxb6 axb6 21. e4 Rfe8 22. e5 Nd7 23. e6 Rxe6 24. Red1 Nf6 25. Nd4 Nxd4 26. cxd4 Kf8 27. Rd3 Nd5 28. Kf2 Rc8 {28... Rf6 ck might be better} 29. a3 Rc2+ 30. Kg1 Rxg2+ 31. Kh1 {if 31 Kxg2? then ...Nf4 ck} Rge2 32. Rdd1 Re2e1+ {?? This blunder is largely a bookkeeping error.   I  didn't have an internet connection at home and had been sending and receiving my moves from computers at the public library.  I had been analyzing 31 Rad1 instead of Rdd1.  When I went to the library to send my moves, I failed to notice that the positon was not the one I had been analyzing.   } 33. Rdxe1 Ke7 34. Rxe6+ Kxe6 35. Re1+ {While not at all happy about my blunder, I did find the endgame interesting.} Kd6 36. Kg1 f5 37. Kf2 {I would have played 37 Re8.} g5 38. Re5 {Again, I would have played 38 Re8.} Ne7 {Besides guarding the f-pawn, the knight blocks the White rook from e8.  I had made my fortress and waited to see how White would try to breach it.  I think White has a win here but it's not easy to make progress.} 39. Kg3 h6 40. h4 {Generally White should avoid exchanging pawns.  I thought maybe White was trying to open the h-file for his rook, but he never made an attempt to transfer his rook to the h-file.  } Kd7 41. hxg5 hxg5 42. b4 {It looks like White might make progress by playing d5 and answering ...Kd6 with Re6 ck.} Kd6 43. a4 Kd7 {Again White could try the 44 d5 Kd6 45 Re6 ck idea.} 44. Rb5 {This doesn't seem like a very good place for a rook, which is a long range piece and doesn't want to get in a knife fight.} Kc6 45. Re5 Kd6 46. a5 {I think the position may be drawn after this.  After the exchange on a5, any attempt by the rook to penetrate Black's position may result in all his pawns disappearing.} bxa5 47. Rxa5 Nd5 {I felt very comfortable now, and felt I could hold the draw with some chances at winning.} 48. Rb5 {?? clearly a blunder.  The White rook steps into an open cage.} b6 {And the door to cage snaps shut.} 49. Kf3 Kc6 50. Rxd5 Kxd5 {}
