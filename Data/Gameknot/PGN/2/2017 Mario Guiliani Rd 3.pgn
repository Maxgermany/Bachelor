1. e4 {I am playing Milind after a long time , } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez. of late this has become my favorite and I kind of like playing this .... } a6 4. Ba4 Be7 {Is there a difference between 4...Nf6 and 4....Be7 ? Nf6  - will delay whites castling ? } 5. O-O b5 6. Bb3 Nf6 7. Re1 d6 {7 ..d6 or 7 ...0-0 ? I think I unnecessarily delayed castling } 8. a4 {This was a surprise. In the game I considered 8..b4 vs 8...bxa4 vs 8....Na5 There was actually another option of playing the light Bishop } Na5 9. Ba2 {Grab the pawn ? or push c5 ? I planned to grab the pawn and  then expected white to play c4 then I can play Nb3 . giving back the pawn and making white lose the Bishop pair } bxa4 10. c3 {I got greedy -- why not try  to hold on to the pawn , ?} Bd7 11. d4 {taking the  center ..?} Nc6 12. dxe5 {Both dxe5 and Nxe5 leaves me with a bad pawn structure. If  ithas to be bad pawn structure -- then whats the hurry - why not keep some pieces on board} dxe5 13. Nbd2 {I think White is better and can get the material easily . } O-O 14. Nc4 Bg4 {protectinbg the e4 pawn} 15. Qxd8 {Unpinning and hence getting the e pawn } Raxd8 {U} 16. Nfxe5 {White  definitely looks good ? } Nxe5 17. Nxe5 Rd1 {I think this was good move-- instead of moving the Bishop , I tried to take advantage of the Bishops excellent position Pn RxR BxR I can swing my Bishop to the queen side and might be able to protect  the a4 paen and neutralize  whites light Bishop} 18. Be3 {while my pawns look badly placed -- I could not see how white can take advantage ..} Rxa1 19. Rxa1 Bd6 {The light Bishop still doesn't move !} 20. Nc4 {e5 is a threat } Be7 21. f3 Bd7 {The other option was Bh5 ? I wanted to keep the option of Rb8 } 22. Ne5 Bb5 {White can play c4 and then I can comeback to e8... resulting in white blocking a Bishop and Black blocking his Rook } 23. Rd1 a5 {Preparing for a3} 24. Bc4 {? White probably saw a few moves and realized he can get a few pawns ...I hoped I can suffer the loss of only one pawn and then would be able to protect } c6 25. Bxb5 cxb5 {atleast they are in one team now } 26. Nc6 Re8 27. Nxe7+ Rxe7 28. Bb6 Rd7 {with a pawn down -- I stil went for the exchange -- I realized with the rook gone the bishop cannot attack the my pawns and I might be able to play on } 29. Rxd7 Nxd7 30. Bxa5 Ne5 {a vert central and useful spot } 31. Bb4 Nd3 {There was no hurry to play this and I should have considered ways to bring my king to the center . g5 should have been considered} 32. Ba3 f6 {I could not see how the King can to the center.g5 could have been better } 33. g3 Kf7 34. Kf1 Ke6 35. Ke2 Nc1+ 36. Ke3 h5 37. f4 g6 38. Bb4 Nb3 39. h3 f5 {forcing white to take a decision } 40. e5 Kd5 {Very central King !} 41. Kd3 Nc1+ 42. Kd2 Nb3+ 43. Ke3 Nc1 44. Kd2 Nb3+ 45. Ke3 Nc1 46. Kd2 {}
