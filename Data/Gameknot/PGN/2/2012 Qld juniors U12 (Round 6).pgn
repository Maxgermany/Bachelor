1. e4 {My favorite: King Pawn, although I played it differently to how I play it now.} c5 {Sicilian defense.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {Following the classical opening principle: Knights before bishops.} Nc6 4. Be2 Nf6 {All four knights have been developed early.} 5. O-O {I castle early.} e6 6. h3 {? A waste of a move.} Be7 {Wanting to castle.} 7. d3 {Blocking in the bishop. See why I do King Pawn differently now?} a6 8. a4 b6 {Unusual, I would've castled by now. This also weakens the a6 pawn, unless the bishop doesn't develop.} 9. Be3 d5 10. exd5 {I accept the swap.} exd5 11. Bd2 {Or else: d4 forking knight and bishop.} O-O 12. Re1 Nd4 {Attacking, except doubles pawns.} 13. Nxd4 cxd4 14. Na2 {My only safe square except for b1.} a5 15. c3 {Wanting my knight back where he wants to be.} Bc5 16. cxd4 Bxd4 17. Bc3 Bc5 {Not swapping?} 18. b4 axb4 19. Nxb4 {Now my knight is back in the action.} Bb7 20. d4 Bd6 21. Bb5 {Looking for any possibilities of an attack.} Rc8 {Threatening my bishop.} 22. Qd3 Ne4 23. Bd2 {? Bishop for knight?} Nxd2 24. Qxd2 h6 25. Rab1 Qg5 {? Why would he do this, I love swapping queens, and he's doubling pawns.} 26. Qxg5 hxg5 27. Na2 {My knight wants his c3 square back.} Bc6 {Fine, I love swaps.} 28. Bxc6 Rxc6 29. Rec1 {Wanting to swap, but I should be trying to exploit his missing h-pawn weakness, if I could get both rooks thereâ€¦} Rcc8 {Wanting to still own the file, I guess.} 30. Rxc8 {But I love swaps.} Rxc8 31. Rc1 {See?} Rc4 32. Rxc4 dxc4 33. Kf1 {Now begins the race of the kings.} Kf8 34. Ke2 Ke7 35. Kd2 Ke6 36. Nc3 {At first, I thought of Kc3, But I think this is better.} Bb4 37. Kc2 f5 38. g3 {I don't want black in my territory.} Kd6 39. f4 gxf4 40. gxf4 {Liking my position.} Kc6 41. h4 Bxc3 42. Kxc3 {The knight for bishop swap was better for me.} b5 {? Now after axb5+ Kxb5 h5 Ka4 a5 a6 b6 or c6, I win the c4 pawn.} 43. axb5+ Kxb5 44. h5 Kc6 45. Kxc4 {It worked.} Kd6 46. d5 Ke7 47. Kc5 {At this point I am going for the queen with only my pawn and king.} Kd7 48. d6 Kd8 49. Kc6 {Somewhere around this point, my opponent offers a draw. NO WAY!!} Kc8 50. Kd5 Kd7 51. Ke5 {This is where I change my mind and go for the f5 and g7 pawns, and then I want to queen.} Kc6 52. Kxf5 Kxd6 53. Kg6 Ke7 54. Kxg7 Ke6 {My opponent resigns, there is nothing to stop me from queening my h-pawn from queening. Thanks for reading, and thanks for the game James!}
