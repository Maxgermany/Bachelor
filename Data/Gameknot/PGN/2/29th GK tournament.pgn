1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 {a strong opening} 4. cxb5 a6 5. e3 {not so usual line but playable...} g6 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Be2 axb5 {taking the pawn at this time, and not sooner, ensures the King's safety and lose of one move (tempo) of White.} 9. Bxb5 Ne4 {a very strong and unexpected move! it is clear now that black has the upper hand.} 10. O-O Nxc3 11. bxc3 Bxc3 12. Rb1 Rxa2 13. Qb3 {even the B line is not enough for white. but it is his last chance...} Qa5 14. Bc4 Ra4 {a must.} 15. Qxb8 Rxc4 {black got a free paw on the C file. it should be enough for a victory...} 16. Qb5 {white is making it easier for black. without quens and with the C pawn, white is doomed...} Qxb5 17. Rxb5 Ba6 {white, apperantly, didn't see that move when he played Qb5.} 18. Rb6 Ra4 19. Bd2 Bxd2 20. Rxa6 Rxa6 21. Nxd2 Rb8 22. Nc4 Rb4 23. Ne5 c4 {the pawn is running!} 24. Rc1 Rab6 25. Kf1 Rb4b1 26. Rxb1 Rxb1+ 27. Ke2 Rb2+ 28. Ke1 c3 29. Nd3 e6 {white cant take the rook. bringing the d pawn behind the c pawn or playing, later, e4 will end the game nicely.} 30. dxe6 fxe6 31. h3 d5 32. g3 e5 33. f3 e4 34. fxe4 dxe4 35. Nf4 Rb1+ {}
