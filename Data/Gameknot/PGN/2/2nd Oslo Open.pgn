1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {The Sveshnikov Variation.} 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 {9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Nd5 used to be the Main Line. 9.Nd5 is now the Main Line, but it does allow Black to maintain a good kingside pawn structure.} Be7 10. Bxf6 {10.Nxe7 is also playable.} Bxf6 11. Qd2 {11.c3 is almost always played here. It allows the knight on a3 to get back into the game and also denies the Black knight access to d4 and b4. 11.Qd2 allows Black to improve the position of his bishop by attacking the queen: 11...Bg5.} O-O 12. c4 Be6 {Black decides to sacrifice a pawn to increase his lead in development.} 13. Nxf6+ {A wise decision. If White can swap off all the pieces, he has a won endgame.} gxf6 {13...Qxf6 14.Qxd6 Nd4 is the right continuation if Black wants to capitalize on White's lack of development.} 14. cxb5 Nd4 15. bxa6 Bc8 {Black has lost the plot. This pawn is not going anywhere and can be ignored. He needed to get his rooks into the game.} 16. Rc1 Bxa6 17. Bxa6 Rxa6 18. Rc3 {Tempting, but the wrong plan. White's advantage is his two connected passed pawns. He should  complete his development and then start pushing the pawns. Any piece exchanges will only serve to increase his advantage.} Kh8 19. Qh6 Rg8 20. Rg3 Rg6 21. Rxg6 fxg6 22. O-O Qg8 23. h4 {}
