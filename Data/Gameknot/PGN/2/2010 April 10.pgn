[Opening "Reti opening (A06)"]

1. Nf3 {Zukertort Opening. The third most popular initial move. A flexible opening.} d5 {A popular response to the Zukertort Opening. Black stakes a claim to the center.} 2. d4 {Standard move. Transposing to a Closed Game.} e6 3. e3 f5 {Until now, we have a standard opening. Here, Black departs from the standard response, which would have been 3...Nf6. However, he plays it on the next move.} 4. b3 Nf6 5. Bd3 {Clears the way to castle.} g6 6. O-O {So far, White has played a stronger opening than Black. White's formation is approaching an approximation of the Colle-Zukertort System. Meanwhile, Black has been advancing his kingside pawns without doing anything about king safety. Indeed, king safety becomes a problem for Black before long.} Bd7 7. a3 a6 8. b4 Nc6 9. Bd2 {By now White has made departures from the Colle-Zukertort System. In the mainline Colle-Zukertort System, White's queenside bishop moves to b2 to exert additional pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal; indeed, this is the purpose of playing b3 in the first place. Nonetheless, White's formation still holds Black's pawns at d5 and e6 and causes mobility problems for Black.} a5 {Not a good move. White can now respond with:} 10. b5 {Attacks Black's knight, forcing it to retreat.} Ne7 {The knight's mobility is now severely hampered.} 11. h3 c6 {Attacks White's pawn, which is now attacked twice (by the pawn at c6 and the bishop at d7) and protected only once.} 12. Nc3 {Protects White's b pawn.} cxb5 {Black decides to trade pawns, which eliminates White's only advanced pawn and isolate White's a pawn.} 13. Nxb5 {However, this exchange puts White's knight in a strong tactical position. White can mate on the next turn with Nd6 unless Black responds.} Qb6 {Black moves his queen to a square where it can simultaneously attack the White knight at b5, the White knight's threatened mating square at d6, and the White knight's threatened forking square at c7.} 14. a4 {Protects the knight a second time. This prevents Black from gaining a material advantage by capturing the knight.} h5 15. Ne5 {! White now has two advanced knights. Black must be careful to avoid a misstep.} g5 {+/= Black had stronger moves available, such as 15...Bg7, which prepares for kingside castling and threatens to attack White's powerful knight at e5.} 16. g3 {It's not particularly easy to see, but a stronger move here would have been 16.c4!, which would make it very easy for Black to misstep and lose a queen. For example, if Black played 16...dxc4, White could recapture with 17.Nxc4, attacking the queen and leaving it with no way to escape. On the other hand, if Black ignored White's pawn on c4, the pawn could advance on the next turn to c5 and threaten the queen directly. Black would have responses that save the queen, but most would come at a cost.} h4 {Attacks White's pawn. Black hopes to take advantage of his rook's control of the h file.} 17. Rb1 {White brings a third piece to bear on the focal point at b5.} hxg3 {Attacks White's f and h pawns simultaneously.} 18. fxg3 {With this recapture, the two sides are even in material, but White's h pawn is left en prise.} Rxh3 {Attacks White's g pawn. Black is now ahead by a pawn in material.} 19. Nc3 {=/+ Discovered attack on Black's queen. However, this retreat by the knight releases the pressure on Black's king. Again, c4 would have been a stronger move and could have been played at any point in the last several moves, but the opportunity is now lost.} Qc7 {Moves the queen to safety.} 20. Qe1 {Protects the g pawn.} g4 {Protects the rook, in case White should try to drive it back.} 21. Nb5 {White rethinks her decision to abandon the b5 square. Attacks the queen.} Bxb5 {! This time, Black takes the opportunity to eliminate the troublesome knight. This does not result in any material gain, since White will immediately recapture, but it relieves the pressure on Black's king and other major pieces.} 22. Bxb5+ Nc6 {! Blocks the check.} 23. Bxc6+ {Results in another minor-piece exchange. This is not helpful for White, because she is quickly losing her most advanced pieces, and she is down in material anyway. Slightly better is Kg2, preparing to deal with Black's rook on h3.} bxc6 24. Qe2 {? White's queen seems to be aiming for something hereâ€”perhaps trying to exert pressure on Black's g pawn or perhaps aiming to reinforce the rook on the open b file--but she inadvertently hangs her g pawn. Better would have been 24.Kg2.} Rxg3+ {! Black exploits the vulnerability and takes the pawn. Blacks is now ahead two pawns in material. More importantly, White's king is under serious threat.} 25. Kf2 {Attacks Black's rook. The only good response to the check.} Ne4+ {! Protects Black's rook.} 26. Ke1 {Forced.} Rb8 {Attacks White's rook. Black hopes to seize the open file by force.} 27. Bxa5 {?? White's bishop hangs itself at a5. Probably White was hoping that this would distract the queen and allow White to play 28.Rxb8+, winning the exchange, but White fails to notice that when Black plays 27...Qxa5+ it will put the king in check, leaving White unable to carry out her plan. (Or Black can play Rxb1+, which has largely the same effect.) This is the only serious error that White makes in the game, but it comes at a bad time. Black can now force a checkmate in two moves, although he actually takes five. Much better would have been 27.Rc1.} Rxb1+ {! Black sees the opportunity to checkmate and executes it, nullifying the attack on his queen.} 28. Qd1 {Forced.} Qxa5+ {? Black could have checkmated here with 28...Rxe3#.} 29. Ke2 Rg2+ 30. Rf2 Rxf2+ 31. Kd3 {Forced.} Rxd1# {}
