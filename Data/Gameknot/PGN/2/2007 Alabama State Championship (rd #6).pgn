1. Nf3 {As the final round od the ASCC begins, I find myself facing Caleb J., who beat me pretty bad a few months ago in another tournament.  In this game, I jump out to a lead and am thrilled at the prospect of winning this last one, but it was not to be. Staying true to my philosophy of playing horrible moves, my 29th and final move was utterly shameful. Ah, well, so goes chess. I only wish that I could win winning positions. My last move so seriously disappointed me that I considered developing a severely bad attitude, but I eventually shook it off and now look forward to me next OTB tourney. I guarantee that you the reader will enjoy this game more than I the annotator. This is painful........} Nc6 {Black meets my 1. Nf3, and a delayed dance of central control starts.} 2. d4 d5 3. c4 {I stick with my QG background, as is quite normal for me. Once again, I will strive for early control of the c file.} Nf6 4. cxd5 Qxd5 {?! Interesting......Nxd is much more common. Now, black sets his queen up as a target.} 5. Nc3 Qd8 {I expected Qa5.} 6. e4 {Ok, I have a nice lead in controlling the center, and numerous developmental opportunities.} Bg4 {Developing, and threatening BxN which will leave my d pawn hanging should I retake with my queen.} 7. d5 {Advancing my potential target pawn, and threatening his Nc3.} Bxf3 {Pressing right ahead, and forcing me to recapture.} 8. Qxf3 Nb4 {?! This one is obvious....he intends Nc2  winning a rook.} 9. Qd1 {Covering c2.} e6 {Wanting to disrupt the centerand getting his DSB into play.} 10. a3 {?! Kicking the knight, but Qa4  may have held much more promise. I missed it totally.} Na6 11. Qa4+ {Now I get a some clarity, and threaten to win a pawn.} Nd7 12. Bxa6 {To claim a pawn quickly......} bxa6 13. dxe6 {....but I first straddle him with an isolani.} fxe6 14. Qxa6 Bd6 {Nice developing move which shields his isolated pawn from danger.} 15. Nb5 {Threatening to win yet another pawn after NxB, cxN, Qxd.} Nb6 {I'm pretty sure he sees what I am up to, and throws some confusion in the mix.} 16. Nxd6+ Qxd6 {?! cxd consolidates his pawns.} 17. O-O O-O 18. Be3 {Realizing that still have a  1 advantage, I strive to simplify via exchanging B for N.} Qe5 {Hitting both my b and e pawns.} 19. Bxb6 {I'm looking to push my pawn advantage as quickly as possible.} cxb6 20. Qe2 {Protecting both of my liabilities.} Rf4 {Seeking equality.} 21. f3 Rff8 {?! I considered this weak. Black is allowing me time to coordinate. } 22. Rfd1 {Claiming control of Broadway.} Rfd8 23. Rd2 {?  I saw RxR, RxR, Rd1, RxR, QxR, Qxb2 and black has achieved equality, and I start getting a little scared. This is my second worse move of the game.} Rd4 {Black shows good patience, and prepares to double up on the d file.} 24. Rad1 Rad8 25. Rd2xd4 {I make my move.....} Rxd4 26. Rc1 {? I had a good long think here, and choose the path of greater mobilty. I should have just traded rooks.} Qd6 {Staying in the center, and preparing back row activity.} 27. Qc2 {Still covering d1, and looking to start a mating attack.} h6 {Creating an escape square while eliminating my ideas of a back row mate.} 28. Qb3 {? Weak....I have bigger fish to fry than hitting his e pawn. Perhaps I should have created my own escape square by playing h3.} Rd2 {! Strong. Black plays for control of the 2nd rank.} 29. Rc2 {????? Yes, I give myself 5 question marks. I should be shot.} Qd4+ {!! Wins, as Kf1 is met by Qf2#, and Kh1 is met by Rd1#. This is a prime example of how not to play chess. A pretty poor showing on my part this game. I end the 2007 Alabama State Chess Championship with an extremely average result of 3/6, and vow revenge next year. I hope you have enjoyed these games. I can't say that there is much to be learned from them, but they were played at a fun tournament with some good opponents. I encourage everyone to get involved with OTB play. It's a whole lot different than playing on GK! - best regards, Thomas.}
