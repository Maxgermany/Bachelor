1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bd6 {Fairly standard opening so far} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 O-O {Still nothing to write home about.} 6. Bc4 Nc6 7. Nxc6 {I have a pathaloical fear of knight's and will almost always take one.} bxc6 {especially if it doubles pawns or otherwise weakens opponents structure.} 8. O-O Be5 9. Bg5 {a feeble pin.} a5 {eh ?} 10. Bxf6 {I said I hated knight's didn't I ?} Qxf6 11. Qd3 Rd8 {d7 pawn was well protected by bishop anyway.} 12. a4 d5 13. exd5 cxd5 14. Nxd5 {So it's not really threatening the black queen, and the bxd5 would have at least threatened the a rook} Qh6 {uh oh..Qh2 dead :o(} 15. Ne7+ {but wait!} Kh8 16. Qxd8# {hehehe... of course that was the plan all along :0))  (I wish!!)}
