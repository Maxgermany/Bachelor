1. e4 {The game that decided the challenger of the World Chess Champion 2015 Magnus Carlsen.} c5 {Karjakin opens with e4,Caruana replies with Sicilian defense.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {Black achieves two central pawns against a single one of white,but white has more way to development} Nf6 5. Nc3 {defends the e4 pawn} d6 {opens the way to light square bishop} 6. Bg5 {Karjakin chooses the Richter-Rauzer Attack,a strong line} e6 {if white capture the knight in f6,black don't need to weaken pawns structure,by re-capturing by Queen} 7. Qd2 {White prepares to castle} a6 {defends the b5 square,attacked by two knights and light square bishop} 8. O-O-O {white,castling,controls very well the d column} Bd7 {develops the bishop} 9. f4 {press on the centre} h6 {most played b5,but Caruana attacks the bishop to make white losing a tempo} 10. Bh4 {recedes,it's not advantageous here the change} b5 11. Bxf6 {Now the change is suitable,and black castling is not very safe } gxf6 {Caruana captures not by queen,to prevent 12.e5 dxe5 13.Ndb5 that threat mate by queen in d7} 12. f5 {press again to open the centre} Qb6 13. fxe6 fxe6 14. Nxc6 {White exchanging the Knights prevents queens exchange,since black King would be strong and more safe without white queen} Qxc6 {also playable,I think,14.Bxc6} 15. Bd3 {white develops} h5 {threatens Bh6,that pins the queen on the same diagonal of the King} 16. Kb1 {King prevents it} b4 {black attacks the Knight} 17. Ne2 {it recedes} Qc5 {black defends b pawn by queen} 18. Rhf1 {develops the rook} Bh6 {Black attacks the Queen} 19. Qe1 {it moves back} a5 {defends the b pawn} 20. b3 {prepares Bc4} Rg8 {attacks the g pawn} 21. g3 {white defends} Ke7 {black king acts now,defending two pawns} 22. Bc4 {attacks e6 and open the d column for the rook} Be3 {bishop occupies the same diagonal of his queen} 23. Rf3 {Here also good Nf4,I think} Rg4 {black activates the rook} 24. Qf1 {attacks the f pawn} Rf8 {black defends} 25. Nf4 {closes the way to black bishop} Bxf4 {takes the knight} 26. Rxf4 {takes back} a4 {pushes to the king} 27. bxa4 {white takes} Bxa4 {black takes back} 28. Qd3 {prepares an attack on d6 and put the queen on the diagonal that includes h7} Bc6 29. Bb3 Rg5 {tries to prevent e5} 30. e5 {but Karjakin advances anyway with e pawn} Rxe5 {black takes} 31. Rc4 {threat the queen} Rd5 {black threat the queen too} 32. Qe2 {moves back} Qb6 {And black do the same} 33. Rh4 {double attack on the rock and on the h pawn} Re5 {attacks the queen} 34. Qd3 {press again on the d column} Bg2 {black defends moving the bishop. Now it was possible a check in h7 by the queen?Black would reply Rf7,white Qg6 that attacks the h pawn already attacked by the rook in h4,but black could defends it by bishop in f3,also attacking the white rook.} 35. Rd4 {then white moves his rook in d column,pressing more and more} d5 {black cannot defend putting the other rock in d8,since white would go in a dangerous check by queen in h7,so blocks the way advancing the pawn } 36. Qd2 {attacks the bishop and the b pawn at once} Re4 {black cannot defend the pawn,so think to save the bishop.Here if the white queen captures the bishop,black would capture the rook in d4.Caruana at that time of the game had only 5 minutes time,and could not see next move of white...} 37. Rxd5 {37.Rxd5!!! A sacrifice that leads to win} exd5 {black takes} 38. Qxd5 {and d column has been finally conquered by white. White threat now mate in d7. If 38...Rd8 39.Qf7#  If 38... Qe6 39.Qb7+ } Qc7 {Caruana chooses Qc7.It seems good,but next move give no chances to black} 39. Qf5 {threat a check by queen in h7,followed by capture of the black queen} Rf7 {defends by rook} 40. Bxf7 {white captures the rook} Qe5 {Caruana,cornered by time and position,tried a last desperate defense} 41. Rd7+ {no problem to Karjakin finding this move} Kf8 {forced move} 42. Rd8+ {if 42...Kxf7 43.Qh7+ Ke6 44.Qd7# 1-0 Caruana resigned}
