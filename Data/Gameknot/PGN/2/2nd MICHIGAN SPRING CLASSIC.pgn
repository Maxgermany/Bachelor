1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 Bg4 5. h3 Bxf3 {he preffered to exchange the figures... but in most games, Bh5 or Bf5 are more played...} 6. Qxf3 Nbd7 7. Nc3 e5 8. Be2 Bb4 9. Bd2 Bxc3 {Another tempo... instead of exchanging the figures, he could've develop his other pieces....} 10. Bxc3 e4 11. Qf4 O-O 12. O-O-O {this was a risky move... even though my king could be left in a dangerous side, i decided throw the pawn-storm at him on his king-side knowing he could do the same to me... } c5 13. g4 Rc8 14. g5 {it's another good move but what would happen after 14...cxd4??? maybe his position would be much better after 15. gxNf3 dxBc3 .... who knows.... but he didn't consider it as a nice going move....} Ne8 {very comfortable move for me} 15. cxd5 {i am winning a free pawn....and so far i don't see the danger...} cxd4 16. Rxd4 f6 17. h4 fxg5 18. Qxe4 Nef6 19. Qg2 gxh4 20. Rhxh4 Ne5 21. Rdf4 {this was my first mistake...} Ng6 {good catch} 22. Rhg4 {i was thinking he would make NxRf4... but i didn't see he could've taken my Rg4...} Nxg4 23. Rxg4 Qa5 24. Kb1 Rxc3 {very good exchange to damage my kingside...} 25. bxc3 Qxc3 26. e4 {this is the biggest blunder.... i should've secured my Bishop... } Qe1+ 27. Kc2 Qxe2+ 28. Kc3 Rxf2 29.
