1. Nf3 {Round three of the 2007 Wa Open.  After drawing a Sicilian Maroczy bind the night before, I came to the board looking for blood.  Unfortunately for my opponent, I was able to exploit some move order inaccuracies and get the upperhand early and never let go.} d5 {The d5 strongpoint systems against the Reti are my favorites to play against.  You are guaranteed a fight from move two!} 2. c4 e6 {Black has other moves, including 2...dc, 2...c6, 2...Nf6, 2...d4 and a few others.} 3. g3 b6 {This move is a little strange.  It seems like Black should be developing and preparing to castle.  There is plenty of time for this move later.  3...Nf6 must be stronger.} 4. Bg2 Bb7 5. O-O c5 {Falling further behind in development, but he does have a solid center.} 6. cxd5 {I wanted to clarify Black's intentions as to his developmental scheme and at the same time avoid the cramping ...d4.} exd5 {Black is going to accept the hanging pawns!  This is one reason why ...Nf6 should have been played already.  Then Black can avoid the coming pawn weaknesses with ...Nxd5.} 7. d4 {Fixing the d-pawn, blocking the light-squared bishop and preparing to play Qc2, Nc3 and Rd1, followed by dc, when my pressure down the d-file will be dangerous.} Nf6 8. Nc3 Be7 9. Qa4+ {Qc2 was better, but Black misses his best response} Bc6 {9...Qd7 is OK for Black.  Now the c6-bishop is occupying the c6-square and the knight wont be able to put counter pressure on d4.} 10. Qc2 O-O 11. dxc5 {Attempting to either isolate the d-pawn, or saddle Black with hanging pawns that will be weak.} bxc5 12. Rd1 {Increasing pressure on the d-file.} Nbd7 {This move allows me to gain the initiative.  More active would have been ...Nc6, forcing a3 and after ...Nc7, Black is passive, but it seems he can defend.} 13. Ng5 {Planning e4, with a solid plus.} Qb6 {This move loses material.  I had calculated the best move for black from the line 13...h6 14. Nxd5! Bxd5 15. Bxd5 hxg5 16. Bxa8 Qxa8 17. Bxg5, when White has the initiative, the better pawn structure and open lines for the heavy pieces.  After 13...Nb6 14. e4! Black cant play 14...d4? when 15. e5! wins a piece due to the threat of mate.  15...Bxg2 16. ef g6 17. fxe7 Qxe7 18. Kxg2 dxc3 19. Qxc3, leaves black down a piece and with two isolated pawns.} 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 15. Bxd5 Ne5 {??  15...Rad8 is clearly stronger.} 16. Bxa8 Rxa8 17. Bf4 Ng6 18. Bd2 {The plan is to play Ne4, Nxf6 and Bc3.} h6 19. Ne4 {Thanks for the help!} Rc8 20. Nxf6+ Bxf6 21. Bc3 Bxc3 22. Qxc3 Qe6 {Simplified and winning.} 23. a3 {Not an oversight, but a pawn in order to activate my rooks on the d-file and the 7th rank.} Qxe2 24. Rd7 Qg4 25. Rad1 Nf4 {This attack is smoke and mirrors.} 26. Rd7d8+ Rxd8 27. Rxd8+ Kh7 28. Qe3 Ne6 29. Qd3+ g6 30. Rd7 Kg7 31. Rxa7 {Endgame insurance!} Nd4 32. Kg2 h5 33. Qe3 Qe6 34. Qxe6 Nxe6 35. a4 Kf6 36. Ra6 Ke5 37. a5 Kd5 38. Rxe6 {Trading into a won endgame.} fxe6 {Forced} 39. Kf3 Kc6 40. Ke4 Kb5 41. Ke5 Kxa5 42. Kxe6 Kb4 43. Kd5 g5 44. f4 {}
