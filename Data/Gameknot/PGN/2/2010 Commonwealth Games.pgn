1. Nf3 {I think I told someone on our team to avoid the four knights defence. It is boring and almost always leads to a draw. However if you have to play it here is an instructive way to defeat it as black. The key is to 1. avoid symetry 2. gain space and create open lines that your pieces can move along. 3. Be patient and wait for your opponent to make a mistake.} Nc6 2. e4 e5 3. Nc3 Nf6 {I could have played 3. ...b6 or 3. ...g6 to avoid the four knights openning but I have a plan. } 4. Bb5 Bb4 {I am following symmetry here but not for long. } 5. O-O d6 {I finally break with the copy cat moves and take time to defend e5. At this point I was dreaming of the idea of being able to play f7-f5 to attack along the F-file.   However as it turns out I missed something pretty big! 5â€¦ d6 5. Nd5 Ba5 6. d3 O-O 7. Bg5 a6 8. Bc4 Be6 9. Rb1 Bxd5 10. exd5 Nd4 11. Nxd4 exd4 12. Qf3+/- } 6. d3 Bxc3 {! a great move that removes a key defender of e4 and takes away any ideas of Nd5 plus it supports my idea of play f7-f5 in the future. Because white will have to defend e4 with the rook which will not be easy to do} 7. bxc3 O-O 8. Bg5 Qe7 {everything is all dead even. It is tough to play these types of positions because it requires alot of patience and small moves that slowly improve your position. Doing anything hasty spells disaster} 9. Re1 Nd8 {because d4 is clearly in white's control and the knight is doing absolutely nothing on c6  I am shifting this knight to e6 where is has more influence} 10. d4 {a good move that puts good pressure on e5 keeps the light bishop from being locked on the queen side. } Ne6 {!? critical move that forces white to decide what he is going to do with the bishop} 11. Bc1 Rd8 {Defends against 12. Dxe5? dxe5} 12. Bf1 {I am not sure what the point of this move was but it helps me. } c5 {in order for a flank attack to work the centre most be sealed so I play ...c5 to provoke d5.} 13. g3 Qc7 {I plan to play Bd7 and Qc8 which sets up a powerful battering ram on the c8-h3 diagonal} 14. d5 Nf8 15. Nh4 h6 {not allowing the bishop back on to g5} 16. Bd2 Ng6 17. Nf3 {17. Nxg6 benefits black because I can make better use of the open lines on the king side} Bd7 {I plan to create a battering ram for f7-f5} 18. a4 Qc8 {White has his plans but so far they are not interfering with mine} 19. c4 Bh3 {playing for 20. Bxh6 when black has mastery over the light squares and makes f7-f5 much easier to achieve} 20. Bd3 Qd7 {developing the queen and connecting the rook on the back rank} 21. Rb1 Rdf8 {f7-f5 is jsut ready to be employed} 22. Qe2 Rab8 23. a5 Bg4 {pinning the knight and making the white queen uncomfortable} 24. Qe3 {? a msitake that leads to no doubt who is in control better was   24. Qd1 Nh7!? and f7-f5 can not be stopped  However now black has a definative way to gain the edge.} Nxe4 {!! Black plays f7-f5 with a dangerous attack} 25. Qxe4 f5 26. Qe3 e4 27. Nh4 {the only move because anything else losses massive material} Nxh4 28. gxh4 {sweet now I have open lines the king. A hunting we will go!} Bf3 {!! this goes for the win as white is helpless to defend on the g file} 29. Qf4 {only move white can not allow ...f4!} Rf6 {Threatening ...Rg6+} 30. Qg3 Rbf8 {Now I am threatening 31. ...F4!} 31. Be2 {?? 31. Bf4 was a must to prevent ...f4 is lossing quickly} Bxe2 32. Rxe2 f4 33. Bxf4 Rf6xf4 {the rest is pure toture for white} 34. Kh1 Rg4 35. Qc3 Rf3 36. Re3 Rxf2 37. Rg1 Rxg1+ 38. Kxg1 Qf7 {Threatening mate in two} 39. Re1 {white finally throws in the towel}
