1. d4 {As round 3 of the 2007 Alabama State Championship begins, I am confronted by a kid whom I've met once. A class B friend of mine tells me he is severely under rated, as he has just begun playing. Great, I tell myself - this may be a little challenging. In the game, I get so wrapped up in winning the exchange that I ultimately lose the game. They say that annotating your losses is cathardic. I hope so - this is gonna be a little painful. No excuses here, I just flat get out played. So much for running the table in this tourney.....White opens with my personal favorite, 1.d4. FYI - this kid went on to win the Reserve section.} Nf6 {My favored response.} 2. Nf3 {Oh geez.....another guy who opens like I do.} d5 3. e3 {!? Intersting. I was expecting 3. c4. White gets his LSB active.} c5 {?! Somewhat akin to a Queen's Gambit with colors reversed. I'm trying to clear room for my Nb8 while introducing the Qa5  threat.} 4. c3 {Reinforcing d4 while preparing to defend against the check threat.} c4 {Closing down his LSB and establishing a definite queenside boundary.} 5. Nbd2 {?! I expected Be2 and 0-0 next. Where is this knight gonna go?} Nc6 6. Qc2 {Hitting my post on e4.} Bg4 {?! Perhaps Bd7 was better. This move doesn't accomplish nearly as much as I wish it did.} 7. Be2 e6 8. e4 {! Argh. I didn't see this coming. White thretaens to dominate the center.} b5 {Supporting c5. I decided that this was more important than his threat of e5 - I would just have to deal with it.} 9. O-O {Kudos to my opponent for exhibiting good restraint. There is no hurry to play e5 yet. Better to secure his king and get another gun into the fight.} Be7 10. Re1 {More well timed restraint. White sees where the action will occur and lines up accordingly.} Nh5 {?? The turning point of the game. I have delusional fantasies of controlling f4, and white turns up the heat immediately. His advantages start multiplying exponentially. Once again, I have listened to the voices in my head that try to convince me that I can channel Mikhail Tal at will. } 11. h3 {White gets the ball rolling, and topples the first domino in the chain.} Bxf3 12. Nxf3 {White's DSB now enters the fray.} dxe4 {I'm hoping for Qxe4, Qd5, QxQ, exQ. Unfortunately, I get it. I failed to consider deeply enough the threat against my Nh5 and the pin that is coming.} 13. Qxe4 Qd5 {0-0 was the far superior move. White is now able to introduce a brutal tactic.} 14. Qxd5 exd5 15. Ne5 {I knew that this knight would move here eventually, and that I had to eliminate him. The resulting position, however, didn't quite register with me. This gets ugly.} Nxe5 16. Bxh5 {! Introducing the pin. I REALLY wish I'd castled when I had the chance.} Nd3 {Immune to reality, I concentrate on winning the exchange and getting back into this game. This knight move seems so natural......but it is ultimately impotent.} 17. Bg5 {White is not losing the exchange here, he is sacking the exchange. My poor DSB is in a world of hurt.} Nxe1 {Whoopie.....................} 18. Rxe1 O-O {I have to let the bishop fall...........} 19. Rxe7 Rfe8 {I'm thinking if I can trade R&R for R&B I may be able to draw, or pressing on R vs. 2B.} 20. Bxf7+ {This kid has great patience. White simply snags a free pawn.} Kf8 {Black shows up late for dinner, and is forced to eat the scraps.} 21. Rxe8+ Rxe8 22. Bxe8 Kxe8 23. f4 {White begins the final push.} Kf7 {I'm desperately looking for drawing lines here.} 24. Kf2 Kg6 25. Kf3 Kf5 {Here I realize I'm lost. I have no way to keep him out of g4.} 26. g4+ Kg6 27. h4 Kf7 28. f5 h6 {Last desperate hope.} 29. Bf4 Kf6 30. Be5+ {White just has too much ammo.} Kf7 31. g5 hxg5 32. hxg5 g6 33. fxg6+ Kxg6 {Unfortunately, this is as good of a position that black will see again.} 34. Kg4 a5 35. a3 {Stopping any idea of a pawn rush.} a4 36. Bd6 Kf7 37. Kf5 {And I screamed "Uncle". Thanks for the lesson kid, and I am greatly looking forward for your promotion to the Open section:) Ok, I'm 2/3 with 3 games left. I still have a shot at a good showing. Time for some rest before round 4, the last round of the day. See you there..........}
