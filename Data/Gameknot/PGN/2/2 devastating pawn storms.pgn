1. c4 {The English Opening. I wanted to try something different from my usual 1.e4} c6 {And an unusual reply! This is the Caro-Kann Defense, usual played after 1. e4 but not unknown as a response to the English. Jun Zhao played it twice with Black in the Asia Championship in 2007 and drew both games after 17 and 8 moves!} 2. d4 f5 {Another unusal choice, taking us away from the English and into the Dutch. } 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Na6 {A complete novelty, as far as I'm aware. This position hasn't been played much, except by Darko Anic, an IM, who always plays 4. ... g6.} 5. g3 {I continue to play the position as if it is the English/Reti, with the king side secure in the fianchetto position and looking to attack on the queen side.} e6 6. Bg2 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. a3 {This may look like a defensive move, preventing the bishop or knight from coming to b4. Instead it prepares b4 and the first pawn storm on the queen side.} d6 9. Rb1 {It is possible - and gm_dursley expected me - to play 9.b4 here. But I always prefer to finish my development first before launching my attack. } Bd7 {Black's a7 knight is now out of position. Na6 is usually played aiming for c7 or to support a c5 pawn thrust. With this in mind I think I would have played 9. ... c5, looking to counter the queen side attack with gaining control of the centre. Black is short of space and sooner rather than later he needs to open the cage door.} 10. Qd3 Be8 {Aiming for g6. Once again I would have been more worried about the knight and would have played Nc7. } 11. Bf4 Bg6 12. b4 {With my pieces in position the time has come to storm the queen side. } Nh5 {Forces the Bishop to retreat, but now Black has 2 useless knight on the edge of the board. Once again Nc7 was the move to make.} 13. Bd2 Nc7 {:)} 14. Rb2 {Preparing to double the rooks on the b-file, thus making all my pieces fully active. } Rb8 {Contesting the queen side via a6 or b6 looks more natural at this stage. } 15. a4 {Four little Dickie-birds, all in a row.... and preparing the b5 thrust.} f4 {A completely unexpected attempt to gain counter play on the king side. Bf6 looks the better move though.} 16. e4 {Simple as that! The four become five and Black's f4 push is going nowhere. } Qd7 {I expected, and probably would have played, fxe3 e.p. Why let me have five pawns in a row?} 17. b5 {My opponent joked that I'd broken up my nice chorus line of pawns with this move. I replied: "Pawns are soldiers, not dancing girls!"} Qe8 {His queen, however, is like a restless 'dancing girl' who doesn't know what part of the stage she should stand on.} 18. Rfb1 {Already the position is looking bad for Black. There is no way for him to find counter play now, either in the centre or on the king side.} b6 19. bxc6 {And finally..... the first piece is taken, after 19 moves! Most unusual in modern chess. } Qxc6 20. a5 {Another possible push was d5 here, but I didn't want to touch the centre in case gm_dursley found a way to gain some initiative. } fxg3 {This move serves no purpose. The only possible reply was e5, looking to break open the centre. } 21. hxg3 Bd8 {Another move without purpose, but what else was possible? Maybe Nf6, or Rb7, looking to double his own rooks. Another good choice is Qb7, making White's d5 push less threatening. } 22. d5 exd5 {I would have left it alone and played the queen to d7 or e8. } 23. cxd5 Qd7 24. Nd4 {Bringing another piece into the attack. The same can be achieved by playing Be3, but that outpost on c6 just looked too good to resist.} Bf6 25. Nc6 {The knight cannot be easily dislodged. In fact it remains here for the remainder of the game. } Rba8 {Retreating into the corner is not ideal here. Rbe8 looks better and offers some hope of countering.} 26. axb6 axb6 27. Rb2xb6 Qf7 {I would have played Ra3, pinning the knight to the queen, hoping to complicate things slightly. } 28. f4 {Playing Qf7 brought my eyes back to the queen side where I noticed Black's knight and bishops all short of space. I realised that I could take advantage of this by playing f4, f5 and g4!} Qd7 {Serves no purpose. h6 was probably needed, or once again Ra3.} 29. f5 Bf7 30. g4 Bxc3 31. Qxc3 Nf6 32. g5 {It seemed natural at this stage to continue pushing the pawn. Bringing the bishop into play via Bg5 was another option.} Nh5 {Black's position is now hopeless.} 33. Rb6b7 {My opponent went off-line at this stage and I'd entered 33.f6 as my conditional move. However, as I had no other moves to make in other games I remained on this board and played on to find that 33.f6 gxf6 34.gxf6 Qg4! was maybe not as clear. So I decided to keep things simple and I switched my attentions to Rb7, pinning the knight. In fact, this is the winning move as the knight is now lost. The queen can't retreat to d8 and e7, which are covered by the knight, and she can't go to c8 due to Ne7 . If she retreats to e8, the only other available square, the knight falls immediately.  } Ra2 34. Bh3 {Putting the queen under more pressure.} Rxd2 35. Qxd2 {And gm_dursley resigned. A possible continuation is 35. ... Re8 36.Qa5 Rc8 37.Rf1 Be8 38.Na7 Rd8 39.Rxc7 and black is 6 points down.  And so, very interesting opening developments and the slow smothering of my opponent by 2 pawn storms well supported by all my pieces. }
