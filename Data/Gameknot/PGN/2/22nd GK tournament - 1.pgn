1. d4 {My standard...} d5 2. c4 c6 {Slav Defense} 3. cxd5 {I figured anyone who played 2...c6 was familiar with developing continuations, so I attempted to get him out of his repetoire as soon as possible.} cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bf4 Nc6 6. e3 {Logical developing moves by both sides so far.} a6 {I was a little surprised by this one. I guess his fear of Bb5 provoked this.} 7. a3 {As I know had some time because of his last move, I play a defensive move to limit his dark squared bishop.} h6 {Another surprise. I would have thought Bf5 was next.} 8. Bd3 e6 {Helping his dark bishop, but limiting his light one.} 9. Nge2 Be7 10. O-O {Development and castling complete.} O-O 11. Rc1 {Rook to open file......} b5 12. Na2 {And here is where the game starts getting interesting. White is trying to restrict the a and b pawns from advancing, while trying to find a new, better home for the knight.} Bd7 {Last developing move for black, and potentially strong as it points towards any upcoming action on a4 and b5.} 13. h3 {Creating escape square for the dark squared bishop. I was concerned with black playing Nh5.} Qa5 {Black now has a very strong presence on the queenside.} 14. f3 {With thoughts of saving my light bishop, as now Ne4 is not possible. If Ne4 were allowed, I would almost be forced to take it with my bishop. While that would double black's pawns, I'm thinking at this point that I need the bishop to stave off attacks on the queenside.} Nh5 {That's what I was scared of earlier...} 15. Bh2 {And the bishop retreats to safety.} b4 {Here comes the push.......} 16. a4 {Allowing the push, and hoping to play b3 to lock up the queenside. At this point I realize that my knight on a2 is now a problem, as it is three zip codes away from any conflict.} Qb6 {I was expecting Rfb8.} 17. b3 {And the position is locked. What is it they say about "be careful what you wish for?"} a5 18. Bb5 {I thought this move was strong, as any retreat by black's knight gives me the c file.} Rfd8 {Planning ahead to retreat the knight, while covering his light squared bishop.} 19. Rc2 {In preparation for loading up on the c file, and opening a square for my Na2.} Na7 20. Bxd7 Rxd7 {And the c file is mine.} 21. Qd3 {Strictly to clear room for my Rf1. It's about here that I start to realize how weak the black Nh5 is. Gonna have to figure out a plan for him.........} Nc8 {I understand what black was doing - trying to find a better station for the knight. But I really thought Rc7 was the play.} 22. Rfc1 {Both barrels now loaded.} Nd6 {Still a very uncomfortable place to be. I'm guessing my opponent was hoping for Nf5.} 23. Bxd6 {A dubious move. While considered inferior because I eliminating a piece that wasn't attacking anything and was doing me the favor of blocking it's own piece, it WAS protecting c8 - which I want to hit hard.} Bxd6 24. Rc2c8+ {And the fighting begins. I felt safe instigating here, because while I am at a bishop deficit, I own the c file and we both have weak knights on the edges. I felt my chances were 50-50 of coming out on top.} Rxc8 {In retrospect, I bet my opponent wishes he had played Rd8.} 25. Rxc8+ Bf8 {Again, Rd8 may have been better.} 26. Qc2 {The only good thing I've got going for me is the c file, so I better purchase it's lifetime membership.} Qd6 {Not much else to do.....} 27. Qc6 {Trying to eliminate black's only real threat. His knight is weak, and his bishop can't do much even IF it gets out of it's blocking role.} Ng3 {?? My opponent saw the folly of this move immediately after he made it. I can win the knight by 28. QxQ RxQ 29. NxN [28. QxQ NxN  29. Kf2 RxQ 30. KxN] or I can win the rook by 28. NxN QxN.} 28. Nxg3 Qxg3 {Another mistake, the rook now falls. Even exchanging queens would have been better, IMHO.} 29. Qxd7 Qe1+ {And h2 serves as a beautiful escape square for the second time in this game.} 30. Kh2 Qxe3 {At least getting something out of the deal......} 31. Rxf8+ {And black resigned. 32...KxR fails because of 33.Qd8  . Retreating just prolongs the inevitable after 32...Kh7 33. Rxf7 Qxd4 34. Qxe6 Qd3 35. Qf5  QxQ 36. RxQ OR 32...Kh7 33. Rxf7 Qxd4 34. Qxe6 Qh4 35. Qf5  Kg8 (or Kh8) 36. Rf8   A VERY good game played by my opponent up until 27...Ng3. He showed a lot of class by not dragging out the inevitable. }
