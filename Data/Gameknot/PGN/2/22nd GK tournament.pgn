[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 {As i'm quite bored at the moment i'm gonna annotate this interesting little game between 2 top players on gameknot, the ending is quite a surprise} c5 {Sicilian, by far the most popular opening at top level chess. due to the imediate imbalances it creates the sicilian leads to all out warfare, there is no such thing as a quiet draw in the sicilian...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {the Najdorf, probably the most popular sicilian variation at the top levels, black is behind in development but his solid structure makes up for it.} 6. f3 {an agreesive continuation (but aren't they all really) intending g4 with a kingside pawn storm, it also maintains flexibility in the development of whites dark square bishop} e6 {black plays the more restrained e6 rather than e5 which characterises the Najdorf and so adopts more of a Scheveningen type setup} 7. Be3 {a nice agreesive square for the bishop, eyeing the dark squares on the queenside which can be of use to white if black is careless} b5 {the battle lines are drawn, black intends to smash through on the queenside while the white pawns march on the kingside} 8. g4 {continuing with operations on the kingside and also preventing Nbd7} Nfd7 {there are 2 main continuations here, this and h6. h6 allows a future Nbd7 but weakens the kingside and spends another move not developing. Nfd7 looks unatural but black wants a knight on b6 eyeing the c4 square and this keeps the kingside pawns as flexible as possible ready for the white attack.} 9. Qd2 {preparing 0-0-0 doubling major pieces on the half open d file, the natural square for the queen where she help pressure the centre and aids the kingside pawns advance} Nb6 {as planned. its quite amazing that black isn't losing here, he has only developed the one piece and white looks almost ready to attack. it just shows how solid the black pawn structure is} 10. O-O-O Nb8d7 {finally black starts developing his pieces, blacks knights start there journey towards c4.} 11. Bd3 {agresive square for the bishopsupporting the centre and covering c4 to help stop a knight invasion} Bb7 {preparing to bring the rook to c8 to support the knight on c4, and of course developing the bishop.} 12. Kb1 {moving the king out of the line of fire before pressing on the kingside} Rc8 13. h4 {now both sides have mostly finished development the start pushing on with there individual plans} Ne5 {homing in on the important c4 square} 14. Qe1 {white moves the queen out of danger as i knight is inevitably going to land on c4. white does not want to play b3 as this severly weakens his kings position} Nbc4 {definatly he right knight, opening the queens line to the queenside and the other knight is better placed in the centre} 15. Bxc4 {better than 15.f4? which allows black to trade off the important darksquare bishop} Nxc4 16. Bc1 {saving the bishop and defending the king whilst keeping an eye on the kingside pawns} Qa5 {very agressive, blacks attack is in full swing while white's kingside pawns are still awaiting there marching orders} 17. b3 {unfortunatly nessecary as black was threaning 17.Na3 ! ripping apart the kings cover, for example 17.Nb3?? Na3 ! 18.bxa3 (18.Ka1?? loses the queen to a fork on c2) 18...Qxc3 and whites king is bare, a pawns doubled and isolated. Along with the isolated c pawn and lack of counter play this adds up to a lost game. } Na3+ 18. Bxa3 {18.Kb2 is met by 18...b4 and 19...e5 winning a piece else the rook penetrates on c2 with decisive effect} Qxa3 19. f4 {the danger on the queenside has temporarily passed so white takes the oppurtunity to continue his kingside pawn storm, unfortunatly this move weakens the e4 square significantly which comes back to haunt white} Be7 {completing devlelopment, mainly trying to get the second rook into the game. the Bishop might also fare well on the long diagonal after Bf6} 20. g5 {preventing the bishop coming to f6 and continuing the kingside attack} O-O {bringing the second rook into play, but maybe the king is safer in the centre after Kd7 connecting the rooks} 21. h5 {now the pawns are really rolling, blacks king looks to be in alot of danger here} Bd8 {getting the bishop into action on the queenside, threatening to pin the knight} 22. Rd3 {white needs to defend the weak knight on c3 as he does not want to move it exposing the weak c pawn to the rook} Ba5 {puts the knight in a very powerful pin as white has no dark square bishop to help break it.} 23. Rhh3 {another defender was required or the e pawn will fall} Bxc3 {this wins the e pawn by force, all the pressure white has been under has payed off, but maybe black should maintain the pin and add more pressure by ...Bb4 ...Qa5 ...Rc5 and ...Rfc8. prehaps this gives white to much time to unravel} 24. Rdxc3 Qb4 {changing the piece doing the pinning, now the e pawn is undefendable and the knight also needs a defender} 25. Qd2 {25.Rhd3? loses simply to 25...Bxe4} Bxe4 26. h6 {with no immediate threat to deal with white starts trying to make some of his own} d5 {very natural. black secures his bishop and d pawn. black just needs to secure his king and then convert the extra pawn to secure the win. Although it looks very unnatural g6 is a playable alternative. it stops all blacks play and although it weakens g7 it is not important as white cannot take advantage of it. remember a weakness is not a weakness unless it can be attacked.} 27. f5 {white continues the pressure on the kingside} Rxc3 28. Rxc3 exf5 {? not the right capture, black should take with the bishop as white does not want to play 29.Nxf5 as simplifies and as whites only chances are in his attack on the king} 29. Nc6 {!! this is brilliant. It infact wins, although at first it is nowhere near obvious and appears to lead to a forced draw. i do not know if Cyrano saw the winning continuation or just the forced draw but the win is spectacular none the less.} Qd6 30. Qd4 {here black resigned, at first i was unsure why as 30...f6 appears to draw after 31.Qa7 Rf7 32.Qa8  Rf8 33.Qa7 etc. i can't imagine a player of Curators level missing this so i can only imagine he saw the spectacle that was to unfold and did not want to see it played on the board, unfortunatly for him i've stuck it on the end here :D} f6 {only move to prevent heavy material losses} 31. Qa7 Rf7 32. Qa8+ Rf8 {not 32...Qf8? 33.Ne7  Rxe7 34.Rc8 when white wins easily} 33. Qb7 {!} Rf7 34. Qc8+ {!} Rf8 {34...Qf8 35.Qe6 with Ne7  to follow is very strong} 35. g6 {!! white sacrices his queen but forces a pawn through} Rxc8 {refusing the sac doesn't work either both hxg6 and gxh6 are met by Qb7 winning} 36. Ne7+ {! the knight is immune as 36...Qxe7 37.Rxc8  wins the queen and forces the g pawn through} Kf8 {only move} 37. Rxc8+ Kxe7 38. gxh7 {nothing can stop the promotion and black needs to sacrifice his bishop to prevent the second pawn promoting or the king getting mated} Qg3 39. h8=Q Bxc2+ {else white plays hxg7 next move. 39.gxh6 also loses as the queen and rook dont struggle to mate} 40. Rxc2 Qe1+ 41. Kb2 Qe5+ 42. Ka3 Qd6+ 43. b4 Qg3+ 44. Kb2 Qe5+ 45. Kb3 Qe3+ 46. Rc3 {black is out of checks and his king is to exposed not to be mated in short order. as always if you've spotted something i haven't or have any queries/comments on the analysis just message me, hope you enjoyed.}
