1. d4 {This game  is from my appearance at the 2007 Alabama State Championship. I played in the Reserve (U1600) section, and by some miracle broke even with a score of 3/6. The chess is not brilliant by any means, but I did have a fun time hanging out with other chess heads. Game #1 was the lengthy one of the bunch, going 57 moves and about 4 hours. It was a tiring, but satisfying start to my first state championship. My opponent is a total stranger to me. He opens with 1. d4.} Nf6 {My preferred response.} 2. Nf3 {This guy opens just like I do with white.  I wonder if he will go for QG?} d5 {Ok, come on.....throw me a gambit pawn.........} 3. e3 {hmmm......White opts to activate his LSB. Truth be told, this is not a line that I am familiar with as I generally play 3. c4 as white. } c5 {Feeling that I had been given a little time, I choose to spread open the queenside. Nc6 and Bg4 seem to hold some promise.} 4. c3 {Bolstering d4.} c4 {Claiming yet more space, locking in white's LSB, and locking up the pawn structure.} 5. b3 {Attempting to unlock the pawn structure and gain more scope for his LSB.} b5 {Consistent with my pawn structure ideas, but perhaps neglecting development.  Maybe 4...Ba6?} 6. bxc4 {Starting some conflict while attempting to gain some range for his LSB.} bxc4 {Maintaining a hammer lock on the center.} 7. Nbd2 {?! White really has to get something going here. While this move does develop, where can this knight go next? Is he worried about my nice e4 post? I think 7. Be2 followed by 0-0 is better here.} Nc6 8. Ba3 {Ok, ok....the whole "freezing same colored bishops" thing. White makes this move to develop while hindering my castling plans.} Qa5 {Hitting the bishop and the weak c pawn.} 9. Qc1 {9. Nb1 also holds promise I think.} Rb8 {While perhaps a bit behind in development, I just gotta jump on the open file.} 10. Be2 Bg4 {Developing with some tactical threats. If I can draw off his Nd2 I can play Ne4 which will win a pawn.} 11. Bc5 {hmmmmmmmmmm.......................................} e6 {My opponents last was intriguing. 11...Nd7 defeats it, but I figure I should go ahead and answer the question of his control of the a3-f8 diagonal. I figure that since my pieces and pawns are better placed than his, I'll simply castle by hand and continue squeezing his already cramped position. } 12. Bxf8 {Of course.} Kxf8 13. h3 {?! I kind of questioned this one. Why disrupt a position that can safely be castled into? h3 does prevent black getting to g4 with a knight, but why commit so early?} Bh5 {Giving my opponent the opportunity to start over extending. Will he take it?} 14. g4 {He does, and makes a huge commitment on the kingside. Now if I can just find a way to exploit it.} Bg6 15. a4 {Perhaps now a little hesitant of 0-0, white now tries to free his Ra1 as b1 is being attacked.} Ke7 {It's taking forever, but I'm trying to get castled:)} 16. Qa3+ {Yes, I see the possibilty of having to dodge a few checks, but they are easily rebuffed.} Kd7 17. Ne5+ Nxe5 18. dxe5 Ne4 {As this knight protects d5, black is encouraged it take it so he can play Qd6.} 19. Nxe4 Bxe4 {White now gets his chance to play Qd6 , but sees that it will run out of gas. Meanwhile, he loses the exchange.} 20. O-O {Correct. Get the king to safety and protect the exchange. The check might still get to be played.} Rb3 {! Hitting the enemy queen and the weak c pawn. White is gonna strut around for a bit, but because of the limited scope of his pieces I should be able to evade him successfully and get my Rh8 over and into play.} 21. Qd6+ {"Hey big guy....buy a lady a drink?"} Kc8 {"You're no lady. Leave me alone. You're drunk."} 22. Qc6+ {"I'm not drunk. I'm in the mood to mate."} Qc7 {"Oh, no you didn't! That's MY man!"} 23. Qa6+ Kd7 {And the frisky queen strikes out.} 24. Rac1 {Protecting the vulnerable c pawn. This was one of those classic "Which rook do I move?" decisions for my opponent. Better him than me:)} Rhb8 {Ok, the gang's all here. Time to get to work...........} 25. f4 {Protecting his "hanging" e pawn (but I have no intent of taking it). Perhaps also consistent with the best pawn structure he could hope for.} Qc5 {White's e3 pawn is weak.} 26. Kf2 {Saving the e3 pawn, but at the expense of being pinned.} Rb3b2 {Yet another pin. } 27. Rfe1 {?! If his king moves he drops a pawn, and his bishop can't move. What does Rfe1 accomplish?} Ra2 {Preparing to hammer the 2nd rank.} 28. Rca1 {White sees my idea and hurries to stop it.} Rbb2 {Naturally.} 29. Rxa2 Rxa2 30. Qb7+ {That crazy queen stalker of mine shows up again. My old lady is really gonna give her a beating.} Qc7 {"Find your own man!!!"} 31. Qb4 Bc2 {! Threatening Rxa4!} 32. Qf8 {Crazy stalker lady tries a different approach, and threatens to start gobbling pawns.} Kc6 {At this point, I figure my position will hold no matter what white does next. If he starts picking off pawns, I'll push my a pawn after his a pawn falls. If he keeps up these empty checks I'll simply keep dodging and do the same.} 33. Qe8+ {"Hello again tall, dark, and handsome....."} Qd7 {"I will CUT you!!!!! Now BACK OFF!!!!!"} 34. Qa8+ {"Geez, your old lady is a real pain. What do you say I kill her and run away with you?"} Kb6 {Not at all interested in the white queen's folly, I head for a6, which I saw as a safe place back at move #32. I'm envisioning winning his a pawn, eliminating all the pieces, and escorting my own a pawn down the board.} 35. Qb8+ {White is reaching the end of the road.} Ka5 {I felt that this was just as safe as Ka6 immediately, and it will allow me to keep a better eye on the white queen if she were on b4, and Bxa4 still looks good. I'm basically try to lure the white queen away from the 8th rank and ideas of pawn snatching.} 36. Qb4+ {What else could white do?} Ka6 {! Ok, now I get to drive for a while. Time to keep with the plan - win a pawn, eliminate pieces, promote.} 37. a5 {The pawn dies with little fanfare...........} Rxa5 38. Rc1 {Much better than Qb2 IMHO. Qb2 is met with Qa4.} Bb3 {All right then.....step one of the plan accomplished. I've won the pawn. Now for some exchanges. And if I may, let me just give a quick shout out to my own queen. Look at everything she is doing and holding together:)} 39. Bd1 {White desperately tries to untangle himself by offering up his bad bishop for my good one.} Ra2+ {Of course I don't take the bishop yet. Time for some tempo.} 40. Kf3 Bxd1+ {Now I take with a check tempo.} 41. Rxd1 Ra5 {??  Huge mistake on my part. I failed to see the upcoming tactic.} 42. Qxc4+ {! Great move. White regains the pawn, throws a check, and dares black to take his queen. White's best move of the game.} Rb5 {Recoiling in horror at my last mistake, I try to regain my focus. I can still do this. My plan may still have a good chance to work. This move does pin me, but I can still safely evade.} 43. Ra1+ {Naturally.} Kb6 44. Qd4+ Rc5 {Carefully plotting my kings escape route.} 45. Rb1+ Kc6 46. Qa4+ {Oh geez.....have I really screwed up this pretty game? Black now threatens to go a pawn up.} Kc7 {Forced.} 47. Qxa7+ {I'm completely suicidal now. Forget about the pawn deficit, I now have a rook hanging.} Kd8 48. Rb8+ {?? Incredibly, white misses the free rook. I will say in my opponents defense, however, that he was very low on time. Perhaps his idea was to quickly exchange off the pieces and press his own pawn advantage. I dodged a howitzer here...............} Rc8 {Being given the reprieve, this rook returns home to defend, most likely to die on c8.} 49. Rxc8+ {White's plan is clear to me. His problem is his clock. He's under 3 minutes.} Qxc8 {Threatening my queen to c3 then d4!} 50. Qxf7 {White is clearly winning, but is taking a whole lot of time. He's now under 30 seconds or so. I would obviously love a draw right here, but I may be able to run out his clock. He doesn't seem to perform well under pressure, so I keep piling it on by playing extremely fast myself. Even though I have something like 22 minutes left, I play the rest my moves in appproximately 10 seconds.} Qd7 {Confusing the issue for white, and eating up valuable time. My opponent is fairly out of seat with hand poised over the board, plainly stressed.} 51. Qg8+ {?! QxQ KxQ e4 and it's all over for black. White is panic stricken for more time.} Kc7 {I really should name this game "The Roaming King". My monarch has safely toured much of his kingdom.} 52. Qa8 {Keep in mind we are flying here. His clock and I are double teaming him pretty cruelly.} Qc6 {I'm convinced that my opponent is convinced that he doesn't have enough time left to do this without his queen.  I continue to offer up a queen exchange in an effort to eat more time. Qc6 has the added benefit of inducing d4 .} 53. Qa7+ Qb7 {White seems locked into a bad plan, so I continue to go along. Tick tock, tick tock.} 54. Qc5+ Qc6 55. Qa5+ Kb7 {He's on delay only here. I'm looking for time wasters........} 56. Qb4+ Kc8 57. Qa3 {Exhausted and out of time, white fails to see Qf8  keeping the attack alive. } d4+ {.....and white's flag fell as he was analyzing the board. This was a win I felt that I swindled. After such a well thougt out plan and such a good position until my tragedy of 41...Ra5. Feeling like one lucky guy, I mark my result and promptly forget about this game. I don't want to even think about how close I was to losing it there at the end. Moves like his 48. Rb8  don't just fall into my lap too often. As this is the first time I've ever played in a 6 round tourney, I tell myself that this game was just a warm up, and I now face a 5 round tournament where I am virtually guaranteed 3 whites.  It's always nice to get a round 1 win with the black pieces. Concentrate on the positive, I tell myself, and move on to round 2............thx to Ronnie B., and I hope you enjoyed. - Thomas}
