1. d4 {fatcat2 vs slockster, I have never won against fatcat2 despite having played him 22 TIMES!!!!! Maybe from this annotation you may understand why, please help me, I can't bear to lose 23 times} f5 {I open with dutch, this was the first time I had used this opening, so perhaps I wasn't as prepared as I thought I might be, still, here goes} 2. g3 {White opens g pawn to allow for bishop hole, this also creates a very strong defence for the king when castled} d5 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. c4 {white seeks to destroy my centre pawns or get them away from the centre} dxc4 {d5? error by me, I should have stayed and held out with perhaps 4.Nc6 5.cxd5 Nxd5 6.Bxd5 Qxd5} 5. Qa4+ {a clever attack, regains pawn and creates powerful centre} Bd7 6. Qxc4 c6 {allows escape route for queen } 7. Bf4 Qa5+ 8. Qc3 {If you play me at chess you will probably notice that I am unhappy to trade queens so early on, mainly because I'm lazy and no queens usually results in a longer game} Qb5 {the real aim here was to disallow white from moving his queen, for threat of Qxb2} 9. Nd2 {this threat however is now gone} Ne4 {error by me, loses pawn due to bishop} 10. Nxe4 fxe4 11. Bxe4 {white now has a sizeable area in the centre and has devloped a lot more that black} Bg4 {I think it needs to be more subtle, Qxe2checkmate seems to cry out} 12. f3 Be6 13. Bd3 {threatens queen, black is now being pushed back a long way} Qd5 {well pushed back, horizontally} 14. e4 {white has now captured the centre} Qh5 {pointless due to protection by knight on f3, black just didn't want to retreat} 15. g4 Qh4+ 16. Bg3 Qf6 17. e5 {queen is being bullied around the board by mere pawns and is now back to here own pawn files} Qh6 18. Qb4 {what did white mean to achieve by this move? I'm not sure } Qe3+ {mind you, what did I mean to achieve from this move!} 19. Be2 Bd5 20. Qxb7 {Oh dear, rook is gone,} Bc4 {checkmate dawns on e2, but it will never have a chance to take place} 21. Bf2 {queen is yet again forced to retreat} Qf4 {every single move from this point on was a conditional move} 22. Qc8+ {now the black king is on an enivitable course that will lead to its destruction} Kf7 23. Bxc4+ Kg6 {black has no options and little time} 24. Qe8+ Kg5 25. Qh5# {and that =s how I lost yet another horrific battle against  opimus felix duos (fat cat 2) but every cloud has a silver lining....right?}
