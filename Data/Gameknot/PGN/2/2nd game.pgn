1. c4 {...English opening..normally this allows White to build up a positional attack on the queen side. Also, it gives White a chance to suss out what Black intends from the opening as the practical replies are limited.} g6 {...this implies black is heading for a Kings indian or Pirc/ Modern defense..I have a  pet reply for these openings in Blitz play...so why not test it in long play..(it has worked there too...)} 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. e4 Nf6 {....main moves of a KID..developing as normal. Black will look to play 0-0, e5,Ne8 and F5...with other developing moves.....} 5. Be2 O-O {..all according to plan so far....except....when you see the next move...} 6. g4 {....it works in Blitz as players mechanically expect Nf3, Be3 etc...the actual aim is to interfere with Blacks plan of f5 and developing the K side. The g4 move disrupts the arrangement....Whites plan will be to 0-0-0 and have rooks on g,h with support of dangerous knights lurking....} Nfd7 7. h4 {...supporting the attack...white plans Be3, Qd2 and 0-0-0...} e6 {...looking to support f5 advance i thought...but look at the development on the Q side of Black and whites pieces...} 8. Be3 e5 9. Qd2 {...i want to eliminate the black bishop which is a key defender / attacker for black....next few moves force this off and help the h5 advance to follow....} exd4 10. Bxd4 Bxd4 11. Qxd4 Nc6 12. Qe3 Nde5 13. O-O-O {...except for the Nf1, White is all developed and almost ready to chuck pain onto the K side....} Nxg4 14. Qg3 {...pawn sac is fine here i thought....with h5 following, i can win a piece with the K on g8 if ...Nf6 h5, Nxh5 Bxh5 as the pawn is pinned..} Nf6 15. h5 Kh8 {...avoiding the pin...time to attack ....} 16. hxg6 fxg6 17. Qxg6 {...pawn is pinned...and material is now even...White has a very strong attack here and pieces ready to come in quickly....Black is effecgtively 2 pieces down on the queen side...} Rg8 18. Qh6 Qe7 19. Nd5 Nxd5 20. exd5 {...leaving  the bishop en pris..You never know !! (Qxe2??, Qxh7# )} Ne5 21. f4 {..maybe this was pre-mature....bringing the Queen back was another option (Qd2 then f4)....} Ng6 {...Nf7 better here....} 22. Bd3 Nf8 23. Nf3 {...all pieces for white about to meander in a kick butt....} Qg7 24. Qh4 {...planning Ng5, Rdg1...huge pressure on the king...can't recover...} Qf7 25. Ng5 Rxg5 {...forced....} 26. Qxg5 Qg7 27. Qd8 {....Black resigns...heavy losses are inevitable here. only move is Bf5... Qxa8, Bxd3, Rxd3...and Black has to defend against the pin on the knight and will lose Queen for Rook & bishop & the position is quickly doomed with Rd3 coming into play very quickly...}
