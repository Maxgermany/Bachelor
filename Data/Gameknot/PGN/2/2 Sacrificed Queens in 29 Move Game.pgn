[Opening "KGA (C35), Cunningham defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 {White opens with a kingside attack. Black responds by accepting and thus up a pawn. My common thinking here is that advancing the e and f pawns is risky because if white makes a mistake, the king is vulnerable. If black makes a mistake, black is down a pawn or maybe a piece.} 3. Nf3 Be7 4. h4 Nf6 {Both sides prepare for further king side activity.} 5. Nc3 d6 6. d4 {White moves to control the center and attack the f4 pawn.} Nh5 {Black moves to protect the f4 pawn and threaten moving to g3.} 7. Bc4 Nc6 {Black and white get more pieces ready to roll.} 8. Nd5 Bg4 9. Nxf4 {With two pieces attacking the f4 pawn and only one defending, white moves to restore parity.} Nxf4 10. Bxf4 O-O 11. Qd3 {White moves the queen out so the king can castle.} a6 12. O-O-O {Castling lines up rook with queen, and lets the rook provide mutual protection. With white's queen and rook lined up, white can advance the center pawns and push black back. White can also push the pawns to threaten pieces in order to get material superiority.} Qe8 {Queen moves where it is not in the line of fire if the d6 pawn is under attack. This also lets the queen move out the white diagonal if/when the knight moves off c6.} 13. Rdf1 Rb8 {Line up rook so black can push pawn to threaten the white bishop.} 14. a3 {White provides a safe square for the bishop.} b5 15. Ba2 Bf6 {The bishop on f6 and knight on f3 can threaten the d4 pawn - but that's not safe if white's knight is still around to protect it.} 16. c3 {White gives the pawn some more protection.} Qe7 17. h5 Rbe8 {Now black can threaten the e4 pawn.} 18. e5 {This does not seem wise. There are 3 white pieces protecting the e pawn, but 5 black pieces attacking it. By exchanging several pieces on e5, black can move its forces out into the open where they have more mobility.} dxe5 {The exchange begins.} 19. Nxe5 Bxe5 20. dxe5 Nxe5 {The exchange ends with four captures and the center columns cleared of pawns.} 21. Qd4 c5 {Threaten white queen to get it move away. Another purpose of this move is so black can move the pawn a step further and block white's bishop on a2. This move has a third purpose which will become evident later.} 22. Qd5 c4 {Bishop blocked. White could advance the b2 pawn to unblock the bishop, but this will do for now.} 23. Rfe1 {White moves another piece to attack the beleaguered knight. The knight seems in danger with 3 attackers and only 2 defenders. This is where the real fun begins as the purpose of previous moves becomes obvious.} Nd3+ {Knight forks king and rook! The black queen is exposed to attack, but that doesn't matter since white's king is under attack and the black queen is free to move! This was the true purpose of advancing the pawn to c4 - to give the knight a perch from where it can check the king. If Kb1, then Nxe1, followed by Rxe1 Qxe1 with white down two rooks. The same happens if Kc2 or Kd2.} 24. Qxd3 {The only way for white to avoid losing two rooks with nothing in return is to sacrifice a queen!} Qxe1+ {Black doesn't accept white's sacrifice just yet. Instead black sacrifices his own queen instead! If white moves the king to c2 now, black picks off the other rook as a prize. If Qd2 blocks, then a series of exchanges on e1 leaves black ahead with two rooks against two bishops. (Qxe1 followed by Rxe1 and Bxe1 and Kxe1 and Rd8+.) No move leads to a good outcome for white.} 25. Rxe1 {White accepts the queen sacrifice and appears to have material superiority. (Actually white does not have effective material superiority since the white queen is ready to be taken and both bishops are too far from the action to influence events.)} Rxe1+ {Black follows by taking white's other rook. The king is in check again.} 26. Kc2 {King moves to temporary safety.} cxd3+ {Black finally accepts white's sacrificed queen and just in time to put king in check yet again.} 27. Kxd3 {If the king moved to b3 instead, then black would counter with Bd1+, king moves to b4 followed by Re4+ which forces white to lose the dark square bishop. If the king moved to d2 to block the pawn on d3, then white would move Rd1+, Ke3 Re8+ followed soon by mate. White's best option here was probably to avenge the queen by taking the pawn.} Rd8+ {Moving the rook to d8 pushes the king back into a corner.} 28. Kc2 {King moves to temporary safety.} Bd1+ {The bishop sets the king up for a discovered check.} 29. Kc1 {King only has 2 options left. One leads to checkmate in 1 move. The other leads to checkmate in a few more moves. (Kb1 Ba4+ then Bc1 to block followed by Rd8d1 to line up the rooks for mate. White would only have a few delaying tactics after that.)} Ba4# {The game ends with a discovered checkmate!}
