1. d4 g6 {Here playing black with the modern opening. It's a blitz game timed 5min + and I'm fight a 2250 elo guy, so I thought my chances were pretty bad!} 2. c4 Bg7 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e4 {It's now looklike to a normal king's indian defense.} d6 {d6 to protect e5.} 5. f3 {Well I prefer Bg5, Be2 or Nf3, but that's fine.} O-O 6. Bd3 e5 7. d5 {Taking advantage of the center.} c6 {c5 would have been better here. } 8. Nge2 Ne8 {Thinking about to do f5. } 9. O-O Bh8 {Well maybe here I should have tryed to develop my other pieces. But there was no hurry, there was no threat at all. } 10. b4 {Well I think Bh6! would have been far better here.} Ng7 {! I wanted to try this move!} 11. Be3 Na6 12. Qb3 c5 13. b5 Nc7 {of course not Nb4, because of 14.Bb1 then 15.a3} 14. a4 f5 {Well this move was planified since a while.} 15. b6 axb6 16. Qxb6 Ra6 {Well getting out of the pin but now I will not be able to use this rook on the king side.} 17. Qb1 fxe4 18. Bxe4 Nce8 {Protecting d6 and ready to do Nf6.} 19. Nb5 Nf5 {Threatening the bishop who's on a very bad position.} 20. Bxf5 Bxf5 {Piercing the wall and threatening the queen.} 21. Qb2 {? Very bad position for the queen because of e4, threatening both the queen and rook.} Bd3 {!! e4! would have been fine too but I thought this move had some potential too.} 22. Nbc3 Bxc4 {Getting the free pawn.} 23. Qxb7 {?? Bad idea to scoot in this area.} Rb6 {! Now white is emprisonned.} 24. Qa7 {The only possible move.} Rb2 {Now the queen can't go on a5 + I'm threatening e2. 2 in 1!} 25. Rfe1 {More concerned about the knight than the queen.} Rf7 {!! Now the queen have no issues at all! } 26. Bxc5 {If I take the bishop then the queen can flee. Sound desparated but at least he get a pawn. } Rxa7 {Deal refused.} 27. Bxa7 Qa5 {Not sure if it was the correct continuation, but the time was running. Threatening both the knight and the bishop.} 28. Bf2 e4 29. Rac1 {The only right move.} exf3 30. gxf3 {White sound in a bad situation but mine is not that much better. My king is totally unprotected and he can take advantage of his knight stationned on e2 to do Rxe8+.} Rb3 {?! Well time was running. I think moving my knight here would have been better.} 31. Nf4 {Threatening e8.} Nc7 32. Ne4 {Threatening the bishop and advancing near of my king.} Qxa4 {Protecting e8, my bishop and threatening both of the knight. Sounded a good move.} 33. Nxd6 {Threatening my bishop and e8.} Rb4 {Well I was very stressed here, my time was going under of 30 sec. I had to move. If I move my bishop, white will do Rxc7.} 34. Ne6 {Threatening my knight so he can can do Re8+, but blocking the way of his own rook. 15 seconds left.} Nxd5 35. Nc7 {?? What a bad move. I think white tryed to do a quick move so I can lose on time. I think Nc5! would have been pretty nice.} Nxc7 36. Re7 Qa5 {Well there's no way I can protect everything. } 37. Nxc4 {1 second left!! I have to move. Got an idea.} Rxc4 38. Rxc4 Qg5+ 39. Kh1 {? Bg3! so he can do Rxc7 after.} Qxe7 40. Bg3 Ne6 {My time is recovering. White have no hope.} 41. Re4 Qd7 {Getting out of the pin and treatening Qd1.} 42. Kg2 Qd2+ 43. Kh3 {?} Ng5+ 44. Kg4 Nxe4 {White resigned here. It was a very fun game even if we have done a lot of mistakes! Nothing harder than to win a won game! }
