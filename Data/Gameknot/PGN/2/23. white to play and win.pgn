1. d4 {Hi all. This is a nice game in which black used a defence I'm not familiar in but succeed to win. } Nf6 2. c4 c5 {Benoni defence. Here the main goal of Black is to break white's center with sac on c5. } 3. d5 {Regular continuation} b5 {"Benko gambit - one of the most well respected gambits against d4. Black's counterplay is very durable compared to many other gambits, in that the queenside pressure can last well into the endgame." - chesscorner.com} 4. cxb5 a6 {The main line again} 5. Nc3 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Bc4 Bg7 8. f4 O-O 9. Nf3 Nbd7 {Balck wants to prevent e5 but this move is maybe a mistake. Better was Bg4. } 10. Ng5 Nb6 11. Be2 axb5 12. Bxb5 {Does better Nxb5? I don't think because at c3 knight is more powerful in case of kingside attack. In the other hand black knight at b6 is blocked by light bishop} Qc7 {To protect and e5} 13. O-O Bb7 14. f5 {The time for pressure on kingside has become. Almost all minor and heavy pieces of white are or ready to consolidate on kingside} h6 {This move creates more weakness} 15. Nh3 g5 16. Bxg5 hxg5 17. Nxg5 {The position now seems equal but black pieces are tottaly blocked - maybe zungzwang. White has enough time to prepare for attack. Black can make only useless moves...  } Nbd7 18. Bxd7 Qxd7 {The same zungzwang again} 19. Qf3 Rfb8 20. Qh3 Kf8 21. Rf4 Ke8 22. Rh4 Qc7 {To open place for king to run... But this move allows white to make a beautiful finish of the game} 23. Ne6 {!! Trap in which black falls directly. If now 23...fxe6 the checkmate follows after 24.Rh8+ Bxh8 25.Qxh8+ Kd7 26.fxe6# (25...Ng8 26.Qxg8+ Kd7 27.fxe6#) But the right way out is to decline knight sac with 24...Qb6 leaving the dark bishop. } fxe6 24. Rh8+ {And black resigns. Thanks for watching}
