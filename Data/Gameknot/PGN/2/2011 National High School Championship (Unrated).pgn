1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 b5 6. Bxb5 Qxd5 7. Bxc6+ Qxc6 8. O-O Bb7 {Scared me for a second.} 9. Nf3 {Wasn't so sure about this move...} e4 10. Re1 Bd6 11. d3 O-O 12. dxe4 Nxe4 13. Re3 {Kind of dumb and useless move on my part. I should've probably developed my queen side more.} Nxf2 14. Kxf2 Bxh2 {Not really sure what he's doing at this point but it does turn a little dangerous.} 15. Rc3 Qb6+ 16. Be3 {Didn't see Qxb2...} Qxb2 17. Bd4 {I thought I was setting up a trap for the Queen.} Qxa1 18. Ra3 {This was where I thought his queen was trapped...} Rad8 {His counter basically soon had us seesawing between trying to get the other's queen and trying to move our queen out of danger somehow.} 19. Ra4 Qb2 20. Nxh2 {Guess he forgot about the bishop.} Qb5 21. Qg4 g6 22. Nc3 Qf5+ 23. Qxf5 gxf5 24. Be5 Rd2+ 25. Ke3 Rfd8 {Not sure why he didn't start taking pawns...} 26. Rd4 f4+ 27. Rxf4 Rxc2 28. Ng4 Kf8 29. Nh6 Rd7 30. g3 Re7 31. Kd3 Rh2 32. Nf5 Rxe5 33. g4 Ba6+ 34. Kd4 f6 35. Nd5 c5+ 36. Kxc5 {Not sure why he did that pawn move...I'm definitely losing but I guess at this point 10pm struck and he became a true unrated player like the rest of us haha} Rc2+ 37. Kd6 Rc8 38. Nxf6 Kf7 {Like I said, 10pm struck and he once again became an unrated player lol} 39. Kxe5 Rc5+ 40. Nd5 Bb7 41. Nd6+ Kg6 42. Nxb7 Rc2 43. Ra4 Re2+ 44. Kd6 Kg5 45. Rxa7 Kxg4 46. Nc5 h5 47. Nf6+ Kh4 48. Rh7 Rd2+ 49. Ke6 Re2+ 50. Nce4 {This was pretty nice I thought. If he didn't take the knight with his rook (and did something like Rxa2) I could've taken Rxh5 which just looks like an awesome mate.} Rxe4+ 51. Nxe4 Kg4 52. a4 h4 53. Rxh4+ Kxh4 54. a5 Kg4 55. a6 Kf3 56. Nf6 Kf4 57. a7 Kg5 58. a8=Q {Resigns}
