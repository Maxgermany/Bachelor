1. e4 Nf6 {My oppenent decides to start the day with the Alekhine's...} 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Bc4 c6 {...gone wrong, I was not expecting that move, is there some line like that that I don't know of?} 5. Bxd5 cxd5 6. Nf3 {I think Nf3 was a little slow on my part, better probably would have been Qf3.} dxe5 7. dxe5 Nd7 {What??????? He's gives me a pawn and allows me to get my queen out, are you kidding me?} 8. Qxd5 g6 9. e6 {Threatening checkmate...} fxe6 10. Qxe6 {...now that is one heck of a queen!} Nc5 11. Qc4 {Backed up a little too far, Qe5 was much better here.} b6 12. Be3 Bg7 13. Bxc5 {Does he actually think I'm going to let him get away with Bxb2?} Bxb2 {Not} 14. Qb5+ {Oops! Looks like he's in trouble know.} Bd7 15. Qxb2 bxc5 {He spent about 2 or 3 seconds on this move.} 16.
