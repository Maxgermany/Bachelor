[Black "Emory Tate "]
[Opening "Old Benoni (A43), Franco-Benoni defence"]

1. d4 {The Queen's Pawn opening, which has a reputation for leading to slow, positional battles. Not this time!} c5 {By avoiding 1...P-Q4 in response, Tate opens the game up to be tactical at once.} 2. d5 {The only logical move.} e6 {2...P-K4 can also be played.} 3. Nc3 {Yermolinsky develops and guards his advanced Pawn.} exd5 {Tate initiates the exchange...} 4. Nxd5 {...and Yermolinsky completes it.} Ne7 {Tate develops a piece and prepares to exchange off Yermolinsky's advanced Knight.} 5. Bg5 {Yermolinsky prevents the exchange by means of a pin.} h6 {Putting the question...} 6. Bh4 {...and dodging the answer.} Qa5+ {Unpinning with a check.} 7. c3 {Rather than retreat his Knight, Yermolinsky interposes with a Pawn.} Nf5 {Tate frees his KB to develop and threatens Yermolinsky's Bishop.} 8. Qa4 {Very clever move by Yermolinsky. If Tate retreats his Q along the diagonal, he loses it. If Tate takes Yermolinsky's Queen instead...} Qxa4 {...which he does...} 9. Nc7# {...he gets checkmated. Nicely played by Yermolinsky!}
