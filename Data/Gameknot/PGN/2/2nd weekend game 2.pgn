1. d4 Nf6 2. e3 {I was expecting 2 P-QB4.} d5 {I take advantage of the opportunity to play this move.} 3. c4 c6 4. b4 {Clearly his plans lie on the Q-side.} Nbd7 5. Nc3 Nb6 {This move provokes a sharp response.} 6. c5 Nc4 7. Bxc4 dxc4 {This Pawn may prove difficult to guard.} 8. Qe2 Be6 {Blocking my KP and sealing in my KB for the moment, but I'm confident I can untangle my pieces before it becomes a problem.} 9. f4 b5 {I was hoping to be able to move my B and develop my K-side pieces after this, but...} 10. cxb6 e.p. {...my brother tossed a spanner into the works with this move.} axb6 11. a3 b5 {Now I can *actually* move my B away and complete my development.} 12. Nf3 Bg4 13. h3 Bd7 14. g4 Nd5 {Centralizing, and provoking my brother into undoubling my Pawns.} 15. Nxd5 cxd5 16. Ne5 f6 {I'm certainly not going to let him plant his Knight in the center.} 17. Nxd7 Qxd7 18. Bd2 e6 {Finally opening a diagonal for the KB.} 19. g5 f5 {Draw agreed. Neither side can make progress. My passed QBP can be blocked by 20 B-B3 and White can easily guard the backwards QRP with Rooks at QR1 and QR2 and the Q at QB1. In conjunction with P-KR4, this would set up a drawing fortress.}
