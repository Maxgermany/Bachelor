1. d4 {Round 5 of the ASCC begins, and and I have the black pieces vs. a total stranger. I've had a good night's sleep, and am committed to playing for 2 wins today. This game begins with a simple tactical victory of a piece during the opening, and my opponent just went downhill after that. There were several instances of him not hitting his clock after making a move. I tried to be a sporting as I could without actually telling him, but I don't think it did much good. He just visibly fell apart after the last instance, toppled his king, then promptly withdrew from the tourney. I felt kind of bad for him, but obviously I took the point and ran. White starts off 1. d4.} Nf6 {As always.} 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Nimzo-Indian defense.} 4. Bg5 {Leningrad variation.} c5 {4...h6 is main line, but I decide to go ahead mix it up in the center. I'm thinking of Qa5 and Nc6 with developmental ideas.} 5. e3 cxd4 {Removing a center pawn and giving my DSB more options.} 6. exd4 Bxc3+ {?! Clearing the way for Qa5 with a tactical hit on his Bg5.} 7. bxc3 Qa5 8. Qc2 {? He doesn't see it, and reinforces his c pawn.} Qxg5 {A piece up this early! This is great! Now to put this guy down as fast as possible - just play smart and the advantage I have should carry the day.} 9. Nf3 {Obviously shaken by his last mental lapse, white spent about 25 minutes on this move (which is a good move IMHO). The problem is, he forgets to hit his clock. I spend a few minutes deciding on my move, and select Qa5. I stare at the clock for about 10 seconds. He sees me looking at it. I then get up and go smoke a cigarette. I'm gone for about 10 minutes. When I return, he still hasn't hit his clock. I glance at the board, then wander off to look at other games. From across the room, I see him finally realize what is going on, and he hits his clock with a look of utter disgust. I return to the board and play......} Qa5 {....the move I selected over 30 minutes ago. My opponent is totally on tilt here, and it shows. I assure myself that I have not done anything unsportsmanlike - it's not my responsibility to manage his time. I now have an overwhelming material and time advantages.} 10. Bd3 {This move was finalized by hitting his clock with dramatic flair. I simply smile at the board.....} Nc6 {?! I think I had better options here....My LSB is still an issue.} 11. O-O d5 {Looking to start liquidating the central tension.} 12. c5 {! I liked this move for white. I drives a wedge between my pieces and secures some boundaries.} b6 {! And I liked this move for black. It threatens to pick apart his pawn advance and gives my LSB some developmental options.} 13. Nd2 {White sees that the queenside is the place to be, and swings a piece over in that direction.} bxc5 {Follwing through with the idea.......} 14. Nb3 {! Winning a pawn. White is starting to claw his way back.} Qc7 15. Nxc5 {White claims the natural post, and I am forced to regroup.} Nd7 {Offering up an exchange of knights.} 16. Nb3 {Rebuffing the offer, white retreats to safety. Again, white forgets his clock, and another 10 minutes or so is lost. This time, I just sit and analyze on his time. He finally comes to his senses, and I hear some interesting four letter words mumbled as he hits his clock.} a5 {Threatening a4, but more importantly allowing an avenue to exchange bishops.} 17. a4 {Stopping the threat against his knight.} Ba6 {At a minimum, the bishops come off. At the maximum, I win the exchange.} 18. Bxa6 {?! White assists my cause, and hits first. Perhaps better was Qe7.} Rxa6 19. Qd3 {Hitting my rook.} Rb6 20. Nc5 {White keeps helping me out here. He should probably play to keep all of his pieces on the board.} Nxc5 21. dxc5 {And believe it or not, he forgets his clock again. He is down to about 10 minutes now, and I still have close to an hour. As the seconds tick away, I stay focused on the board and decide Rb2 is my play. When he finally hits his clock at around 3 minutes, I snap off a very quick.........} Rb2 {......and white resigns in disgust. I felt kind of bad for the guy, and we shook hands with smiles. I could tell, though, that this fellow was furious with himself. He whipped out a piece of paper, wrote a message to the TD, and promptly left the site. Sorry Jerome - I'm sorry you struggled. But I'm not sorry at all about winning - that's 3/5 and I still have a little hope of cashing in on some runner up money. See you in the last round:)}
