Nf3 O-O 5. c3 e6 {One downside to the Hippopotamus Opening is the weakness of the a2-g8 diagonal, if one plays the Hippo correctly. (Unlike me, this game)} 6. d4 d5 {Getting ready to attack the center.} 7. e5 c6 {This is about when I realized I still had a light-squared Bishop to develop! Oh, what a klutzy thing to do.
