[Opening "Sicilian (B95), Najdorf, 6...e6"]

1. e4 {king's pawn opening. KPO. a very good opening move. white controls many light squares with this move.} c5 {the best reply. sicilian defence. controlling dark squares and expanding on the queen side.} 2. Nf3 {normal developing move.} d6 {black gets some space for his peices.} 3. d4 {white creates ideal center. also opened several squares for his peices.} cxd4 {black ends the W pawn formation. ...cxd is forced. other wise white might play d5 with good game.} 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {attack} 5. Nc3 {defence} a6 {a famous move. protecting b5 and planing to play b7-b5.} 6. Bg5 {W improves his position.} e6 {vacating a sq for the B and protecting the N with Q so that after BxN blk can recapture with Q and keeping the pawns in good shape. blk pawns on d6 & e6 are called small center.} 7. Nf3 {third move of the N. i think white's advantage of first move is diminished. Qd2 is much better.} Be7 {unpinning the N and preparing 0-0.} 8. e5 {white started attack. should have focused on peice development.} dxe5 9. Qxd8+ Bxd8 10. Nxe5 Nbd7 {attacking the unprotected N with a developing move.} 11. Nxd7 Bxd7 {another peice comes into play.} 12. O-O-O {R comes to open file with a trap.} Bc6 {...0-0 ?? BxN removing the guard. BxB RxB.} 13. Bxf6 {bad move, there was no need of taking this N and giving up well deployed piece.} Bxf6 {blk has the advantage of 'pair'. both Bs are beautifully placed, pressurizing both wings. blk has the upper hand.} 14. Ne2 {white saved himself from getting 3 isolated Ps. if f3 then BxN PxB. WQ side will be weak.} O-O {protecting the K and connecting the Rs. another method of joining the Rs was Ke7 but it has a flaw.} 15. Nd4 {attacking strongly placed B.} Rfd8 {setting a trap.} 16. Nxc6 {?? .} Bg5+ {suddenly black attack and white resign. note if the K was on e7 i can not play Bg5 due to check by the knight. if Rd2 BxR Kb1 bxN black has won a R. if Kb1 RxR back rank mate.}
