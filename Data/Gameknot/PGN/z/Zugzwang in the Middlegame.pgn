1. d4 {This game features a rare form of zugzwang, with plenty of pieces on the board, black is having difficulties finding moves.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 {Not avoiding the Nimzovich.} Bb4 4. Qc2 O-O 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Qxc3 b6 7. Bg5 d5 {Not really popular and for good reasons. It blocks the b7 bishop and creates a backward pawn on the c-file.} 8. cxd5 exd5 9. e3 c6 10. Nf3 Bb7 {Black is already having problems defending the c-pawn.} 11. Ne5 h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 13. Rc1 Rc8 14. b4 {Not allowing the freeing move c5.} Rc7 15. Bb5 {Using the newly created pin, the white bishop develops at the best possible square.} a6 16. Ba4 b5 {Dooming the c6 pawn.} 17. Bb3 Qe7 {Preparing to evict the Knight from e5.} 18. O-O Qd6 19. Rc2 {Ganging up on the c-file. Very crude play but effective in the given position.} a5 {A nice move to create counterplay and free the Ra8.} 20. Rfc1 {Consistent with the formulated plan.} Na6 {Putting pressure on b4 and at the same time developing the Knight from b8 at move 20.} 21. Nd3 {Not releasing tension. This is another point why the development of the Bishop to b5 and subsequent rerouting to b3 was better than the natural d3, this square is needed for the Knight.} a4 {A big mistake. After this move, Black won't be able to generate any counterplay at all.} 22. Ba2 {Getting ready to aim at h7.} Kh7 {Very politely moving in the line of White's planned diagonal.} 23. Bb1 g6 {Black doesn't dare to move the Knight from a6 in fear of Nc5. Also he was trying to obstruct the b1-h7 diagonal.} 24. Qb2 {Preparing a double battery, the c-file and b1-h7 diagonal.} f6 {Preventing Ne5, but further weakening the diagonal.} 25. Rc2c3 f5 {Black now sees that g6 would come under fire, so he plays another kingside pawn to prevent this. But now Ne5 is again possible.} 26. Ne5 Nb8 {Going to d7 to exchange the White Knight.} 27. Qc2 {Finally, White's desired setup is complete. Every piece is optimally placed, as opposed to Black's huddled in a corner.} Rg7 {Trying to defend g6, but removing a defender from c6.} 28. h4 {This is both an attacking and a defensive move. It makes sure there won't be any bank-rank mates and plans to dismantle the pawn defenders on the b1-h7 diagonal.} Nd7 {Black can't contain himself anymore. The Knight on e5 was already threatening to sacrifice itself at g6 so he chose the exchange it at the cost of a pawn.} 29. Nxc6 {Finally the weakling at c6 has fallen.} Bxc6 30. Rxc6 Qe7 31. Rxg6 {Now the Rook gets the opportunity to clobber the kingside pawns.} Rxg6 32. Qxf5 {A deadly pin. White's double battery has proven its worth.} Raa6 33. h5 {A nice touch to White's 28th move.} Nf8 34. hxg6+ Nxg6 35. Qxd5 {The Queen is removing the Black infantry with no resistance.} Qg7 {Over protecting the Knight in order to remove the pin.} 36. Qxb5 {Capturing another pawn with tempo.} Rf6 37. Rc6 {Exchanging everything now that White has amassed an army of foot soldiers.} Rxc6 38. Qxc6 {Black resigned here since there was nothing he could do after the forced exchanges to prevent the b-pawn from Queening.}
