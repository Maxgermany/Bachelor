[Opening "Vienna game, Max Lange defence (C25)"]

1. e4 {This game was interesting because of the fact that it taught me that superior space & mobility were able to overcome a material defecit.  Well, technically a material defecit.  My opponent hemmed in his own rook, so I was actually playing up the exchange the whole game.  But in the end my opponent pretty much mated himself with his own pawns anyway, so it all came out in the wash.  :)} e5 2. Nc3 {I enjoy playing the Vienna Game because I'm a big fan of the f-pawn push.  This opening can turn into a King's Gambit after black plays the natural 2...Nf6, and white can push the f-pawn without having the bother of 2(or 3)...Qh4 .  None of this happens in this game, however.} Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d3 d5 5. exd5 Nd4 6. Nf3 Bg4 7. Be3 Bd6 8. h3 Bxf3 9. gxf3 Qd7 10. Bxd4 exd4 11. Ne4 Qe7 12. Qe2 Bb4+ 13. c3 dxc3 14. bxc3 Ba3 15. Bb5+ Kf8 16. c4 {My usual display of thud and blunder.  My bishop has nowhere to go.} a6 17. Ba4 Qb4+ {Dropping the piece.  Ouch.  But I have excellent central expansion and control as compensation.} 18. Kf1 Qxa4 19. Qe3 Bb2 20. Rb1 Qxa2 21. Kg2 Re8 22. Qc5+ Kg8 23. Qxc7 Nxe4 24. dxe4 {Excellent central pawns.  Those bad boys are dangerous.} Bd4 25. Rhf1 Bxf2 26. Qxb7 Bh4+ 27. Rb2 Qxc4 28. d6 g6 29. Qd7 Rd8 30. Qc7 Qd4 31. Rb7 {A very imposing position -- for both sides.  My dark squares are extremely weak, making his bishop huge, but he's basically playing an exchange down due to his other being locked in behind his king.} Qd2+ 32. Kh1 {My king looks loose over in the corner, but black doesn't have time to exploit the weakness because he's got my mate threats to contend with, too.} Rf8 33. d7 Kg7 34. Rfb1 Qf2 35. Qc3+ Kh6 {With the d-pawn eyeing a big promotion, my rooks begin their trek back to the open g-file to harass the loose black king.} 36. Rg1 Rfd8 37. Rb2 Qa7 38. Rg4 Be7 39. Rd2 Rhg8 40. f4 a5 {Not sure why he didn't take the d-pawn here.  Trade pawns when you're up pieces is the rule.  } 41. f5 g5 {The genesis of a bad bishop and an incarcerated king.} 42. Qc6+ Kh5 43. Rdg2 Rxd7 44. Qc1 {Preventing ...Rd1  and some unnecessary trouble.} f6 45. h4 {That's a tough pawn.} h6 {The blunder of the game.  Black locks in his king with his own pawn.  Nowhere to run to, bay-bee....nowhere to hi-ide....} 46. Qc2 {Gotta get to the d1-h5 diagonal.} Rc7 47. Qd1 {Here he resigned as there's no way to stop 48.Rxg5 (double check), 48...Kxh4 with 49.Rh5# following.  Even 47...Rc1 (pinning the queen) fails because of the double check; the queen still guards the rook's mating square.  A very aesthetically pleasing mate.}
