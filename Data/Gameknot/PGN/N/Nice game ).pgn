1. e4 {I opened up with e4, my favorite when I started this game, though I like the English more now.} e5 {Typically.} 2. Nf3 {Maybe getting into some dull game :).} Nc6 3. Bc4 {I opted for an Italian game or even a 2 knights defense.} h6 {Preventing the 4.ng4 and the c bishop in the near future. } 4. d4 {Striking at the center.} d6 {This was a big mistake, it wins at least 1 pawn, I will show you. } 5. dxe5 Nxe5 6. Nxe5 dxe5 7. Bxf7+ {This was the move that won that pawn, but...} Kxf7 {OMG, I was thinking, giving up the queen.} 8. Qxd8 {He should have resigned then.} Be7 {I was anticipating bd6 with thought of maybe trapping the queen. } 9. Qxc7 Nf6 10. Nc3 {I don't even sweat. } b6 {Another pawn? Thx! } 11. Qxe5 Re8 {Of course that bishop will move :D.} 12. Qg3 {Let's retreat and regroup.} Bb4 {Nice, attacking the e pawn twice and preparing to kill it's only defender, too bad it won't work. } 13. f3 Nh5 {What does it exactly? } 14. Qc7+ {Block with the b4 bishop or you are totally screwed.} Re7 {Too bad for you dude.} 15. Qc4+ Ke8 16. Qxb4 {I think he had not got enough, what is he expecting :S.}
