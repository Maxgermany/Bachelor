1. e4 c5 {This is Sicilian defence which is a popular response to White's 1. e4 and one of the openings which has made the King pawn opening percentage wins slightly lower than that of 1. d4. Louis Paulsen, a German, was one of the early practitioners of the Sicilian defence and was a defensive player who said that brilliant attacks would fail against correct defence. Paulsen could draw one game against Paul Morphy and his ideas influenced Wilhelm Steinitz who developed the art of defence in chess. Black's idea here is to exchange his Bishop's pawn for White's central pawn on d5 and build a central pawn majority which will be pushed in the endgame for queening one of the central pawns. An endgame is favourable for Black. So White's strategy is to play for a win in the middle game by attacking Black's king whether it is castled or not. The tactical battle in the middle game is a minefield and either player can win or lose suddenly as happened in this game.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf variation is named after Polish-Argentinian GM Miguel Najdorf. It is one of the most deeply studied openings and a favourite weapon of many World champions like Mikhail Tal,  Tigran Petrosian, Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand. This is a thematic tournament. } 6. Bg5 {A sharp line of attack similar to the Richter- Rauzer attack.} e6 7. f4 {Attacking immediately with a pawn storm on the king side and threatening to win Black's knight with e5 push. By the way this is the starting position of this thematic tournament.} Qc7 {Unpins the knight on f6.} 8. Bxf6 {White disrupts Black's kingside pawns.} gxf6 {In Najdorf, the broken pawns on the king side are surprisingly defendable. Black sets up a defensive pawn barricade in the centre and is provoking White to try and attack his defensive centre. } 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. O-O-O Bd7 {Black plans to castle on the queen side as his king side castle wall is broken. White's pawn storm on the king side can also be avoided. How shall White play from here?} 11. Kb1 O-O-O 12. Bc4 {Attacks the e6 square and also defends the White castle against the imminent onslaught by Black on the queen side. White has completed development and is ready to attack.} Rg8 {Black's rook occupies the half open g-file.} 13. Nxc6 {White starts to get rid of Black's defending pieces. The situation here is that White has more pieces ready to attack the queen side than Black has in defence. The bishop on f8 is not available for defence in this game.} Bxc6 14. Bb3 Bh6 15. Rhf1 b5 {Black starts his attack on the White castled king.} 16. a3 {White stops an immediate b4 for the time being and also creates a luft for his king.} Kb8 17. g3 a5 18. Qe2 {A subtle move to plant the c3 knight on b5 if Black pushes b5 to b4.} Qb7 19. Rfe1 Bf8 {Black's dsb is trying desperately to get into the action. Time is an important factor in many Sicilians and Black's development problems have to be exploited by White ASAP or else Black completes his development and tries to reach a favourable endgame.} 20. a4 {White tries to disrupt Black's advancing pawns and open up the queen side for attack. This move is creating a base for the White knight on c3 which lands on b5 and cramps black's movement on the queen side.} b4 21. Nb5 {Black dislodges the knight on c3 and weakens White's central square e4. White's knight settles close to the Black king's castle. The position is double edged and something has to happen soon.} f5 {Black attacks the e4 square and is trying to win an exchange.} 22. exf5 Bf3 {Black carries out his plan and hopes to win the end game.} 23. Qe3 Bxd1 24. Rxd1 exf5 {Black is + 2 in material.} 25. Rd5 {White's rook threatens f5 and also plans to land on b5 or a5 and gobble up Black's loose pawns.} Rd7 26. Nd4 {Knight vacates the b5 square so that the Rook can come in with a devastating attack on the b-file. It also attacks the pawn on f5.} Kc8 {To avoid the threat of White rook arriving at b5.} 27. Qe8+ Rd8 28. Qe2 {White's queen occupies the White squares with tempo by giving a check and coming to e2. It is instructive to see how the weaknesses on White squares lead to the downfall of Black's game. Another point here is that overall material plus is not sufficient. The material plus in the area where the battle is taking place is more important. White has all his pieces ready for attack on the queen side whereas Black's dsb and one Rook are on a vacation far away from the battle zone.} Rd7 29. Rxa5 {White's threats are unstoppable and Black resigns. Likely continuations are  A) 29...Re7 30. Qd3 Kd8 31. Bd5 Qc8 32. Ra8 and Black loses his Queen. B) 29...d5 30. Qe8+ Rd8 31. Qe5 Be7 32. Nxf5 Bf8 33. Bxd5 Qb6 34. Bxf7 Rg6 35. Ra8+ Kb7 36. Bd5+ Rc6 37. Rxd8 Qxd8 38. Nd4 leads to heavy material losses for Black.}
