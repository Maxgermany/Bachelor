1. e4 e6 {The French Defence... } 2. d4 Qh4 {Very dubious... This isn't much of a threat as I can develop and protect the pawn nicely } 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 {I gain a tempo on blacks queen.. The queen might end up trapped if black isn't careful } Qh5 5. Bd3 Qg4 {? Black needs to develop his other pieces instead of making cheap threats that could be easily parried. I considered playing 6. e5 Qxg2 7. Rg1 and white would lose a piece as he won't be able to save both knight and queen} 6. O-O c5 {Finally, blacks starts operation at the centre} 7. h3 Qh5 {The only square for the queen. Qg6 runs into e5 where I win the knight} 8. Be3 b6 9. e5 Nd5 10. Nxd5 exd5 {Now I can get in c3} 11. c3 Be7 12. Re1 {Not bad but perharps I should have tried Kh2 threatening g4 next move to win the queen} d6 13. Kh2 cxd4 14. g4 {?? I saw the error in this move immediately I played it. Now I lose a piece by force } Bxg4 {Definately the correct response. The h3 pawn is pinned so this bishop is immune } 15. Bxd4 Qxh3+ 16. Kg1 Bxf3 {Oh dear, white's king must be sweaty right now, I have no option but to give up my queen in other to avoid mate on h1 } 17. Qxf3 Qxf3 18. Be2 {Retreating with tempo and covering the g4 square } Qh3 19. exd6 {With this move I set a trap. If Bxd6 then I play Bg4+ capturing the black queen} Nd7 {Damn! He dosent fall for it} 20. dxe7 {Maybe, just maybe he would play Kxe7 } Rc8 {Hmmm, he dosent still fall for it  } 21. Rad1 h5 22. Rd3 {Blacks h-pawn might become dangerous if not watched carefully. Note that Bxg7 leads to Rg8 where I will lose the bishop due to the pin } Qf5 23. Kf1 {Now the pawn on g7 is safe to capture } f6 {? This wasn't a good way to protect the g7 pawn. Nf6 was probably best as it gets a piece closer to my weak king } 24. Rf3 Qc2 {?? This move loses the white queen by force } 25. Bd3 {! Now black must give up his queen to prevent mate on g6 but instead, the black queen goes pawn hunting} Qxb2 26. Bg6# {Checkmate!!! A narrow escape for me i`d say }
