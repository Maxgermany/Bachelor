1. f4 {bird opening, my prefered} f5 {fred opening (?) normaly this defense lose whith me when i play bird. But this is a hight rated challenger... } 2. e4 {my way to attack his "fred" defense. More often black play the same reversed to attack the bird and it's good against it ! so i will do the same ...} e6 {of course, they dont have to take the poisoned pawn} 3. exf5 {taking some risk, } exf5 4. Nf3 {normal development in order to castle and n case black Qh4 or something like this} Nf6 {same devlopment} 5. Bc4 {this is going to cause him troubles} d5 6. Bb3 {ok i keep my bishop treat for after} Bd6 7. d3 {defend pawn} O-O 8. O-O Re8 {taking the e colon} 9. Nc3 {presuring d5} c6 {defend it} 10. a3 {at this time a was whith no special plan, so i decided to attack this d5 pawn whith Ba2...b2-b4 ...b5. Witch is to long i konw but i didnt found anything better, and this is a blitz so we have to think quickly. Whould you have some other good idea ??} Nbd7 11. Ba2 {preparing b4, it will help me anyway after ...} Qb6+ {nothing dramatic for the moment} 12. Kh1 Ng4 {ok, now i see his plan, knigh in f2 wins the tower...hum...} 13. d4 {i have a chance !} Ne3 {this is not going to stay there for long !} 14. Bxe3 Rxe3 {now this tower is less dangerous than the bloody knight, and i will be abble to treat it after. for the moment i have to keep my f4 pawn. whith the f knight is possible and a good advanced position in e5. If black take it, i take back whith d4 and i will win a very good pan position in king side} 15. Ne5 Nf6 {black dont take it, in way to defend d5 and maybe in way to go to e4 again. it will be a problem because now i dont have naymore black bishop} 16. Na4 {so let's attack his queen !} Qb5 {i have a good response to this : c4 !} 17. c4 {if ....d5xc4 18.Ba2xc4+!! and win the queen so this must give some trouble to blacks !} Qa5 {now, with b2-b4 the queen will have to retreat} 18. b4 Qd8 {you see ! And now i take again the initiative} 19. cxd5 {first i will weaken d5 in way to attack with the a2 bishop} cxd5 {then i will treat this poor lost e3 tower !} 20. Qc1 {defending a3. It could be a trap to let him take the paw and then to move Ba2 xd5+! i lose a bishop and win a tower, but this 1698 elo's player should see it, doenst he ?} Re4 21. Nc5 {little blunder, i forgot my d4 pawn !} Rxd4 {but it gives me a good oportunity : i exchange the tower, and then the d5 pawn is mine treatening a fork whith the a8 black tower ...} 22. Rd1 {first} Rxd1+ 23. Qxd1 {second} b6 24. Bxd5+ {third !} Nxd5 25. Qxd5+ {here it is !!! nice, isnt it ?} Kh8 26. Nf7+ {and this is better !!!! black resigns. I played a first time as black against jdude818 and lose, so this was M NICE BIRD REVENGE !!! }
