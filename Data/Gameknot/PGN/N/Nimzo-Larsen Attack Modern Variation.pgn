[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {First move for the Nimzo-Larsen Attack} e5 2. Bb2 {Right off the bat I am challenging his control of the center without even having pieces actually at the center.} Nc6 3. e3 {I feel like this move is kind of an illusion personally. He thinks I am going for the center with this move, when in reality if I really was, I would just move the full two tiles forward. I like to get him to overthink what I am doing, which as you will see causes him to give me the game.} d5 {See? He grabs center right after my third move, thinking that is what I was going for.} 4. Bb5 {Classic challenge of the knight. } Bd7 {He reinforces.} 5. Bxc6 {I take it, because why not?} Bxc6 {He keeps falling into my Nimzo-Larsen trap. :)} 6. Bxe5 {I use my second move trap to take control of the center. See? He was too busy thinking about my pawn in the middle "trying" to take center that he forgot about my bishop, allowing me to get a free piece.} Qe7 {Him realizing what he just did wrong. :p} 7. Nf3 {Reinforcing my position in the center.} O-O-O 8. O-O {Castled.} f6 9. Bg3 {Still controlling the center, but at a distance. Slightly attacking c7.} Qd7 10. Nc3 {I go to attack his control of d5.} Bd6 11. a4 {Just expanding my territory so to say with the pawn. Sure I could have took his bishop, but I wanted to let him come to me, creating a bubble in his defense.} Bxg3 12. fxg3 {Took his bishop. See the bubble it made?} Ne7 13. Nd4 {Attacking the bishop on c6.} Rhe8 14. b4 {Just gaining more ground and closing him in. Technically it is a free pawn right now, but not for long.} Kb8 15. b5 {Reinforced the pawn, again, also attacking c6. Trying to expand upon the king-side bubble I have made. He realizes his mistake and resigns. And this is how you win a chess game in 15 moves using the Nimzo-Larsen Attack: Modern Variation. He could have kept going by moving his pawn to b6, but I guess the pressure was too much.   This is not the strongest opening, but may offer psychological advantages. It also doesn't give away your opening advantage like many other openings, which may come to a shock considering the first move doesn't look like you're doing much. This opening is labeled as A01 also. If you watch the whole game, you can slowly see my pieces sneaking their way over to his king-side moving in for the checkmate. I wish my opponent wouldn't have resigned so I could show the whole game, but that just proves this opening can be super strong given practice, ability and confidence. :)  }
