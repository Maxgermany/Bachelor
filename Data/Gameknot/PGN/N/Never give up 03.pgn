1. d4 d6 2. Nf3 Nd7 3. Bf4 Ngf6 4. h3 e6 5. Nbd2 Be7 6. e4 {This is contrary to my typical dev plan, but black is playing so passively...} c5 {Fireworks suddenly start. } 7. Nc4 cxd4 {Challenge accepted. Now let's see what happens.} 8. Nxd6+ {Or Bxd6 (BxB, NxB+, and black loses castle rights. But black is not forced to take the bishop...)} Bxd6 9. Bxd6 {I expected Nb6, since black cannot keep the pawn in d4. } Nxe4 {...but has his own to cash. Oh, well.. } 10. Qxd4 {Maybe wiser was to keep the bishop.} Nxd6 11. Qxd6 Qe7 {Well, the game is even, except that I have a better developement, so I'll try to keep it this way.} 12. O-O-O Qxd6 13. Rxd6 O-O {Maybe better Ke7. Without the queens... etc. etc. } 14. Bb5 Nf6 15. Rhd1 {If black plays well, I have nothing. But this means to play b6 right now, and after Rd8, Bb7.} g6 {This solves the back rank threats, but keep delaying the developement. } 16. g4 {First oversight: } Ne4 {hmmmffff. A pawn is lost. Well, go on with the attack, then,. } 17. Rd6d8 Nxf2 18. Rxf8+ Kxf8 19. Rd8+ Ke7 20. Re8+ Kf6 21. g5+ Kg7 {I'm shooting in the water, I know, but I have to get the most of it. } 22. h4 {...and keep my left pawns, and keep him unable to develop.} Ne4 {And here I made my second big oversight. } 23. Ne5 Nd6 {Uh-oh. So easy to see it now... :-(} 24. Re7 {Well, I can lose the exchange only, but I'm playing for fun. Let's see...} Nxb5 25. Rxf7+ Kg8 26. Re7 Nd6 27. Ng4 Nf7 28. Nf6+ Kg7 29. Re8 {Here is mate in one, if black plays the wrong move, or he has to lose the rook. But he found the right one. } Nd6 {So the king has a square to escape. } 30. Rg8+ Kf7 31. Rh8 e5 {I thought he will go for the repetition... but of course not. } 32. Rxh7+ Kf8 33. Rh6 Kg7 34. h5 {Another trap: if gxh, Nxh+ and then RxN!} Bf5 {Correct, but is his turn to oversee...} 35. Rh7+ Kf8 {And with Rh8+ I win a rook. } 36. Rh8+ {He resigned. I think that, a part of the rook falling, the g and h pawn will be enough to win. But in a blitz game, a mistake can be done at all time. Anyway: never give up, even after a blunder so... heavy, to say the less. And a technique excercise, how to get the most of a slight advantage.  I think that "know how to recognize advantages" is becoming one of my beloved expertises in chess...}
