[Opening "Queen's Indian (E15), Nimzovich variation (exaggerated fianchetto)"]

1. d4 {Eilonwy's favorite.} Nf6 {Lately I have been experimenting with 1 ... g6. The move in the game is my old standby. I thought I would revert to this because I had already played the modern defense against this particular opponent and I wanted to mix it up a bit.} 2. c4 e6 {Tried and true.} 3. Nf3 b6 {I don't have much experience with this since the large majority of players I have faced choose 3. Nc3 rather than face the Queen's Indian.} 4. g3 Ba6 {I don't really know what I'm doing here. I played this move here mainly to avoid the possibler gambit line 4 ... Bb7 5 Bg2 Be7 6. d5.} 5. Qc2 Bb7 {An apparently ignomious retreat, but the point of Black's previous move is to pull White's pieces out of optimal position. The Black Bishop was always headed for b7. If I had been more familiar with the line I may have chosen 5 ... c5.} 6. Bg2 Be7 {An unassuming move. More aggressive alternatives are 6 ... c5 and 6 ... Bb4+. Immediately after I made this move I regretted that I didn't look at Bb4+ more closely, but as it turns out, the Bishop on e7 has a great future.} 7. Nc3 O-O 8. e4 {I know from previous games that this guy likes an expansive pawn center. Nothing wrong with that as long as you don't allow your opponent to tear it apart later.} d6 9. O-O {Now both Kings are safely tucked away in their respective Kingsides; at least for now.} Nbd7 {So Black has completed his minor piece development and White has a decision to make: what to do with the QB?} 10. Bf4 {This caught me by surprise. If it had been me, I probably would have opted to fianchetto this Bishop.} Nh5 {Well, why not?} 11. Be3 c5 {Black eventually has to make some sort of break in the center, otherwise he'll get squashed.} 12. d5 e5 {White has decided to lock up the center pawns, which favors the attacking side. I wonder which side that will be, hmmm?} 13. Bh3 {White has decided to go on the offence. The Bishop eyes the f5 square and occupies an important diagonal.} Bc8 {So I counter with my Bishop} 14. Qa4 {Again I was caught by surprise. Should I worry about a future Qc6?} Nb8 {I decide to worry about it, although I did feel like my pieces were going in the wrong direction. White looks better to me here, but I was wondering about his intentions. Is he trying to attack Kingside or Queenside?} 15. Bg2 {I think this deserves a question mark, but the computer let it pass without comment.} f5 {Now that White has ceded the important h3-c8 diagonal to Black, he can play this important break. What could White be thinking?} 16. Nh4 {Oh, whoops! The computer gives this a ??} f4 {Since I'm on the attack, I have no problems with locking up the center even further. Of course White can't play 17. g3xf4 because it leaves the Knight on h4 hanging.} 17. Bd2 Bxh4 {Now I'm glad I didn't play 6 ... Bb4+ with an aim to trade this bishop!} 18. gxh4 Qxh4 19. Qd1 {So the Queen comes back to the defense of the King. Nevertheless, 19. f3 was better.} a6 {Just a plain waste of time. Now White can still play f3.} 20. Be1 f3 {Finally Black decides to prevent f3 and opens up the f-file for his Rook to boot.} 21. Bxf3 Nf4 {The computer didn't like this and prefers 21. Bh3. A possible line is 21 ... Bh3 22. Bxh5 Qg5+ 23. Bg4 Bxg4 24. Qd2 Rf4 25. f3 Bxf3+ 26. Bg3 Qg4. } 22. Ne2 {Bringing another defender into the fray.} Bh3 {Now Black gets this shot in.} 23. Nxf4 Rxf4 24. Bd2 Rf6 25. Re1 {So White has managed to save the exchange, but now the f2 pawn is weak. Of course, on 25. Bg2 then ... Rg6} Nd7 {Getting ready to bring the other Rook to the f-file.} 26. Re3 {At the time I thought 26. Rc1 was a better try, but the computer doesn't like it. The computer thinks that 26. Re3 is White's second best move, slightly preferring 26. Kh1. (A very computer like move. The idea is to get the hell out of Dodge!)} Raf8 {That's a lot of stuff trained on the f2 square.} 27. Qe2 {Understandably trying to defend, but he misses Black's next shot.} Rf6xf3 {Removing a crucial defender.} 28. Rxf3 Qg4+ {Of course not 28 ... Bg4 29. Rxf8+} 29. Rg3 Qxe2 {The end is near.} 30. Be3 Rf3 {Whoops!} 31. b3 {Waiting for the end.} Rxg3+ 32. hxg3 Qf3 {With mate coming the next move, White resigned.}
