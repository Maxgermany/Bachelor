[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 {Caro-Kann} 3. e5 {Advanced variation I give up the f5-b1 diagonal for space and a restriction on the g8 knight. Black typically responds with Bf5 then white can play Nf3 without worry of a pin. Though whites queen will be tied down to the defense of the c2 pawn till I move it or defend it with another piece.} Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Nh4 {Please forgive this move. I missed the queens obvious defense of the h4 square.  However this loss of piece will give me the Psychological advantage. Besides a mistake free game rarely occurs at this level of play. I say "Psychological advantage" because I'm going to be looking for every way back into this game while my opponent might let his guard down and make a mistake.} Qxh4 6. Be3 {The f2 square is sort of weak and I want to put my b1 knight from b1-d2-f3 to drive away the queen.} Nd7 7. Nd2 Nh6 8. Nf3 Qd8 9. h3 {To keep the h6 knight out of play.} Qb6 10. b3 Bb4+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 {Whites position is very defensive and pieces are coming off the board white will be looking for a mistake to pounce on and try to keep from making any more mistakes.  Like a cat that looks for the slightest twitch.} c5 13. c3 cxd4 14. cxd4 Be4 15. Be2 {I'm very focused on keeping the knights out of play my d4 pawn and h3 pawn are very important to me.  The Knight coming to f5 was the move I had expected to see trying to take my d4 pawn and get into the game.} O-O 16. Rg1 f6 17. exf6 Rxf6 18. Ng5 {Planing to exchange of knight for bishop. My reasoning is that it will open up the position a bit and two knights do not work quite as well together as a bishop and knight.} Raf8 19. Nxe4 dxe4 20. f3 {This was my critical defensive idea I was going to keep the f-file closed the best I could.} Nf5 21. O-O-O {Defends d4 and gets my king away form the deadly rook battery.} e3 22. Qb2 {The other possibility Qd3 though a fine move blocks my e2 bishop, and doesn't have the future idea though as abstract as it sound of focusing on the g7 square. I've found that if I can effectively tie down the front battery piece the whole battery is weakened. This move also stops the advance e5.} Nb8 {Planing on Redeveloping on c6 to overload the d4 pawn.} 23. Bc4 {This was the only move I could find to give the d-pawn some life.} Rc8 24. Kb1 {I don't want to be pinned. This also breaks up blacks battery.} Nc6 25. Rge1 {My point is that black must take with the f5 knight so I'll take the e3 pawn. Of course this depends on black not being able to use any good discoveries on my rook.} Ncxd4 {? I don't like this move and the reason is I can remove the defender of the d4 knight. Though my opponent had decent try to counter this plan.} 26. g4 Nxf3 {?? At this point I knew I had something I think e2 may have been more effective.} 27. gxf5 {! Black will want to take the e1 rook as not to loose a piece for nothing but better may have been just to take back the pawn with the rook.} Nxe1 28. Bxe6+ {I'm down a lot of material so this move looks rather funky do you see my idea yet?} Rxe6 {Black wants to avoid losing a whole rook here.} 29. fxe6 {Here I knew black would move the knight to f3 but, the black knight is now lost no matter what black does I think best for black is just to cut the losses and play Qxe6.} Nf3 30. Rd7 {My idea black doesn't have anyway to defend the g7 square without losing at least a piece.} Qd4 {?? not the best block better was Nd4 which would give black chances.} 31. Rxd4 Nxd4 32. Qxd4 {The rest of this game is pretty straight forward white has the advantage and goes on to win easily.} e2 33. Qd2 Re8 34. Qxe2 g6 35. Qe5 h5 36. Qf6 Rf8 37. Qxg6+ {}
