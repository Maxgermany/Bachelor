1. Nc3 {Think they call this the dunst?} d5 2. e4 dxe4 {Maybe I should play d4 but I like this line} 3. Nxe4 e5 4. Bc4 Bf5 {Probably a mistake in hindsight but looked good at the time!} 5. Qf3 {Strong move, making Bf5 look bad.} Bg6 6. h4 {Looks pretty toothless to me..} Qd7 {The point is to force my bishop away from the defence of the mate on f7 but this covers it nicely.} 7. h5 Bxe4 {Forced.} 8. Qxe4 Nc6 {forced again.} 9. d3 Bb4+ {I know he ( and I ) am going to castle long, so thought I'd force c3 to weaken his queenside a bit.} 10. c3 Bd6 11. Bg5 f6 {Have to play this. leaves me open to Bxg8, Rxg8, Qxh7, 0-0-0. But I think black is fine there.} 12. Be3 {He agrees apparently} O-O-O {Now I castle} 13. O-O-O {as does he} Nge7 {also considering Na5 but think this is more solid and requires less analysis ;)  White - 15 minutes Black  - 16 minutes} 14. Ne2 g5 {Intending to follow up with f5. Also inviting hxg6, which I'm fine with.} 15. hxg6 e.p. hxg6 16. b4 {Maybe there is better counterplay for white..} g5 {for the same reasons as last time I played it.} 17. g3 {providing an escape square for the queen.} Rdf8 {Providing an extra kick for f5, being able to follow it up with f4, and then f3 forking the queen and knight.} 18. d4 {Providing a much needed escape route for the queen, maybe a weakening move structuarly though..} f5 {here come the pawns..} 19. Qc2 f4 20. dxe5 {probably a mistake. I should exchange rooks before playing my next move.} Nxe5 {Should exchange rooks. He can exchange the rooks and pin the knight against the rook with the bishop here.   White - 5 minutes Black  - 12 minutes} 21. Bd4 {Luckily he misses it in time trouble and (like me) plays it a move too early} Rxh1 {winning a piece} 22. Rxh1 Nxc4 23. Qb3 Qe6 {threatening the knight. it can only drop back to g1, which loses} 24. Re1 {he should drop the queen back to protect the knight here.} f3 {winning the knight} 25. Qa4 {A move that definitely has holes in, but hard to spot in the nick of time!  White - 3 minutes Black  - 5 minutes} a6 {The wrong move. Underestimating b5.} 26. b5 Ba3+ {have to try and mate him now  White - 1 minute Black  - 4 minutes} 27. Kc2 Qf5+ 28. Kb3 {His moves play themselves yet I have to try and dig out a mate!} Qd5 {bad move. He should just take the knight here. But he has no time to think} 29. Kc2 Qe4+ 30. Kb3 Nd2+ {White loses on time. Think I have this won anyway, Kxa6, Qe6 and black is winning. Last few moves were a bit crazy but had to be made in seconds!}
