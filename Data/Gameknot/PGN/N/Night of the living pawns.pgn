1. e4 b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. c4 {???? Usually I play 3. f3 then 4. c5. Somehow I pushed the c-pawn first... and so dropped the e-pawn.} Bxe4 4. Nc3 {Well, I have dropped a central pawn for nearly nothing so, as far as I am concerned, playing conservatively will just lead to a loss, so I will working hard for either complications, an attack or anything that will unbalance the position.} Bb7 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. Bg5 Be7 8. O-O h6 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Be4 c6 11. Re1 O-O 12. Bc2 d6 13. Qd3 Re8 {..g6 was preferred.} 14. Qh7+ Kf8 {d5 starts off the attack and the sac...} 15. d5 {This move begins an all out attack where I will sac material readily.} Bxc3 16. dxe6 Bxe1 17. Qh8+ Ke7 18. Qxg7 Bxf2+ 19. Kxf2 Kxe6 20. Bf5+ {The bishop invites the king out to play.} Kxf5 21. Nd4+ {The bishop gives up its life in order to draw the king completely into the open. Black was trying to find shelter with ..f5. Now perhaps..bf5  isn't necessary, but I found a long mating net. That seemed a pretty sure thing. On the other hand, if the king can avoid check for just one move, the black queen will probably insert herself into the situation and white's attack will be halted.   Here is what may happen.

But down a pawn, I looked forward to slow death if I played it safe.   But while I thought I had a mating net, I think black can find safety on the a4 and b4 squares, shuttling back and forth.  The problem is that white needs to bring the rook into the final mating step, and if black plays carefully, I don't see how white can weave the mating net.   Instead, it is a draw.} Ke4 22. Re1+ Kd3 23. Qg3+ Kxd4 24. Qc3+ {Kc5 then mate with b4.  Black could have prolonged it, but there was a mating net in any case.}
