1. e4 {This is a game i played against jobadz19 whit white. In this game black gets into alot of pressure right at the start of the game.} e5 2. Nf3 d5 {A surprising reply. This line is called the elephant gambit.} 3. exd5 {I figured it's ok to accept, because white can gain a tempo after queen recaptures.} Qxd5 4. Nc3 Qd6 {The queen has to stay and protect the e5 pawn, which will cause some trouble for black.} 5. Bc4 {The bishop is looking at the weak spot at f7.} Bg4 6. Qe2 {This move protects whites lsb and pins the pawn ok e5 to blacks king.} Nd7 {Here i thought black will castle queen side, so i figured id try to do the same. And by deciding this my pawns on f2, g2 and h2 were more free to be moved because my king would be placed on the other side of the board.} 7. h3 {Here i was expecting the bishop to retreat and after g4 it would be placed on g6.} Bxf3 {This move allows white to put pressure on the f7 pawn.} 8. Qxf3 {This double attack hits f7 and b7.} Ngf6 {This basically puts the knight into a pin.} 9. Qxb7 {White gobbles the pawn forcong black to castle king side.} Rd8 10. Qf3 {And the queen just retreats on its outpost on f3.} Be7 {Black ispreparing to castle.} 11. g4 {Here i thought that d3 would kind of let black stable his game, so i played this. Black is under pressure now, because the knight is still virtually pinned. } h6 {This stops g5.} 12. h4 {And white renews the threat immediately.} O-O {Now the knight is free to move because blacks rook is covering f7, but castling into a ready made attack can be lethal.  } 13. g5 Nh7 {Knight retreats. Black doesn't seem to have alot of counterplay. Whites bishop still on c1 is doing a good job covering d2.} 14. gxh6 Qxh6 15. d3 {Now i played this, because i gained another tempo. White stands better here. Blacks pieces are all quite passive.} Qg6 16. h5 Qf6 {Whites attack is getting dangerous, but he hasn't castled. Will the king in the center backfire?} 17. Qg3 {White avoids the queen exchange. The queen is now looking at g7.} Bd6 18. Nd5 {And again white gains a tempo.} Qf5 19. Bh6 {Now black is in troube. Almost all whites pieces are ready for an attack.} g5 20. hxg6 e.p. {White ignores the rook and captures the pawn, dismembering blacks king safety.} Qxg6 {If 20. Fxg 21. Ne7+ Kh1 22.Nxg6+ Qxg6. And theres no defense. But this move allows a mate also, but its more beatiful.} 21. Qxg6+ {Qxg6+ black is forced to take in order to avoid mate on g7.} fxg6 22. Ne7+ {Ne7+ its a double check which drives the king to h1.} Kh8 23. Nxg6# {And a beatiful mate for the finish. Blacks pieces are working well together to stop the black king and this was made possible by numerous tempo gains.}
