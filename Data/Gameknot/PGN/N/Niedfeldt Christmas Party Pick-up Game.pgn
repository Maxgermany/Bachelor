1. d4 d5 {I was going to open with an Indian system (1. ... Nf6) but I thought that it would scare him or annoy him no end, since I'd told him that I wasn't "that good."} 2. c3 Nf6 3. e3 e6 {Preparing for 4. ... c5} 4. Nf3 {This may not be the actual move; in fact, except where otherwise noted I'm just playing rough transpositions of the actual move order.} c5 5. Bb5+ {Perhaps no brilliancy, but a sound move.  David is no halfwit opponent.} Bd7 6. a4 {Again a sound move that most novice players would not think of.} Qa5 7. Bd2 Bxb5 {But, he is not well-versed in pins.  I quickly grow overconfident.} 8. Na3 Qxa4 9. b3 Qa6 10. dxc5 Bxc5 11. b4 Be7 12. Nxb5 Qxb5 13. Qa4 Qc6 {I didn't feel like trading queens; I thought I might be able to mount a spectacular center attack and finish the game quickly if I was patient.} 14. b5 Qc7 15. b6+ Nc6 {I missed that my queen was en prise and instead blocked with the knight so as to develop simultaneously.} 16. bxc7 O-O {From this point, I do not remember move orders or board positions until what is here Move No. 24.  I do remember swearing at myself silently, blocking the passed pawn, and being forced to exchange my knight.} 17. Ne5 Nxe5 18. c4 Nxc4 19. Rb1 b6 20. e4 Bc5 21. Bf4 Nxe4 22. Qxc4 h6 {I no longer recall where in the move orders this fell, but it was close to what is here Move No. 24.  This was not played to relieve pressure on the king, per se, but rather to let my king attack.  I figured that if David invested the time to get his queen deep in my backfield (as he had, on occasion, considered - at one point even playing Qc3, but withdrawing it a few moves later) I could safely run my King out for a moment and perhaps even regain material.} 23. Qa4 Rfe8 24. O-O Rec8 {This board position was reached later in the evening.  David had made various probing attacks into my backfield with his queen, and I had summoned up the confidence to tell him that my pieces were all guarded, and that this was the problem with being up a queen but down in minor pieces.  I negelected to mention that 25. Ra1 ... 26. Qxa7 Rxa7 27. Rxa7 can force queening, or that he could blow the exchange and still be ahead, ignoring a few pawns.} 25. h3 {I think David played this move to mirror my h6.  I don't believe that he saw a direction for this game to go with my defenses not budging, and he may have played this to avoid a theoretical future back rank mate and stall until a draw was offerred.} Nc3 {I however did see a direction which would give me much better chances than I had been staring at until moments before.} 26. Qa1 Ne2+ {A decoy attack on the queen!  I do not plan to win the exchange and fall apart in a rapidly approaching endgame, but rather win a bishop complements of the house.} 27. Kh2 {I would have recommended Kh1, but this is not bad until later moves make it so.} Nxf4 28. Qe5 {Not bad, but I see a way to make it so...} Nd3 {My poor heart was going a mile per minute here.} 29. Qc3 {A solid move.  He is trying to force me to release his passed pawn and give up my knight and bishop for the cost of a rook on b4.} Nxf2 {My only forward move.  If he accepts the exchange I can not fathom where the game would go, but fortunately for me he plays conservatively.} 30. Qe5 Ne4 31. Qf4 {?  He doesn't see what I saw on Move No. 28.} Bd6 32. Qxd6 Nxd6 33. Rbc1 {Trying to save the passed pawn.} Nc4 {Of the last nine moves, this knight has made eight.  He has killed 13 points of material, and attacked another rook, king, and two pawns on top of that.  He has attacked more than 3/4 of the squares on white's side of the board, and now he secures white's passed pawn.  This ends the game, and David's subsequent play shows it.} 34. Rf4 {Again, the precise move orders may not be correct.  The board positions are, however, roughly correct.} Rxc7 35. Kg1 a5 36. Ra1 a4 37. Rf3 a3 38. Rb3 Rb7 39. Kh1 d4 40. Rd3 e5 41. Rb3 b5 42. Rbb1 b4 43. Rbd1 b3 44. Kh2 b2 45. Rab1 a2 46. Kg1 axb1=Q 47. Rxb1 Ra1 48. Rxa1 bxa1=Q+ 49. Kh2 Qf1 50. Kg3 Qf4# {This was a very fun game.  David is a good player and has some strong non-theoretical ideas, which really gives me a run for my money in fast paced over-the-board play.  I probably won't play him much anymore since I know I can win from Queen over bishop odds, but still - a very solid player and an excellent game.}
