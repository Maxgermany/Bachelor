1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ gxf6 6. c3 Bf5 7. Nf3 Rg8 {My first decision beyond what I play as Book. This should slow White down a little. The bishop has to stay on f1 for now to guard that pawn.} 8. Nh4 Qd5 {I plan to castle queenside, anyway, so this gets the queen out of the way. I really didn't want to play Bg6 and block the rook that I just moved.  What will I do if he plays Bd3? Maybe trade bishops, and then he's threatening Qxh7, so I can play Qh5 to guard the pawn and attack his knight.} 9. Nxf5 Qxf5 {This could get wild in a hurry. I've never had anyone trade on f5 before. I wonder if he's planning to follow up with Bd3 and threaten Bxh7. But after Bd3, I'm going to move Qd5 with my attack on g2.} 10. Qb3 b6 {I really don't like this move so much. But since I'm planning to castle queenside, I don't want to retreat to c8. And I don't want to go to d7 and block my knight. But maybe that would work better and plan to go to c7 (if he doesn't develop the bishop to f4).} 11. Be3 e6 {Now I'll have to live with my queen on the kingside. Is he going to castle queenside? That's so unusual against this opening.} 12. O-O-O Bd6 13. g3 {Now I'm in lots of trouble. There's the blunt threat of Bd3 that attacks the queen and the pawn on h7. But worse is Bg2. I''m not going to be able to stop d5, and that's when the game falls apart for me.} Qf3 14. Rg1 Qh5 15. Bg2 Ke7 {No, I'm not going to get to castle after all. I need my king to help defend the center.} 16. c4 Qg6 17. c5 b5 18. cxd6+ {Blunder. Went too fast. I've gotten my rating high not so much by playing so wonderfully as much as I haven't made many blunders like this on GameKnot. It seems to me, if you avoid bad blunders and timing out, you can get at least a 1400 or 1500 rating on GameKnot.}
