1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. e3 c5 {I think it's all standard till here. I know black's f5 has its downsides, but if I am well aware of them I can go on fine. } 4. Bd3 cxd4 {My decision, I dont' know. True, I kind of help his N to develop, but it doesn't seem a problem. } 5. exd4 {Pawn takes. My dsb has e7 or d6 after d5. } Nc6 {Maybe Qc7, preventing Bf4, was a little better. } 6. O-O d5 {I am not sure it was needed. This just invites white into c4. But I have to develop somehow. } 7. Bg5 Be7 {Nothing to be worried about yet, right?} 8. Nbd2 h6 {I better ask some questions around, just to let him know I exist. And, besides, I had a kind of a plan to exchange dsb and change the shape of the game. Probably not a good plan. } 9. Bh4 Qc7 10. Bg3 Bd6 {This was the idea. Now white has to choose, but finally he will be forced into...} 11. Bxd6 Qxd6 {I've got a semiopen c column, and I'm in position to castle whenever needed.} 12. Nb3 {As white, I would have attacked with c4 asap.} Nb4 {Now, I do. I know that the check will come, and...} 13. Bb5+ Bd7 {For once in my life I play black as black: a drawn if you let me. But I have a good reason to play this.} 14. Be2 {If BxB, KxB and I have connected the R with a solid shield for my K...} Rc8 {Of course pressing c2. } 15. Nc5 {f3 was expected (Nc6),} b6 16. Nxd7 {NxN was just getting back in developement. } Kxd7 17. Bb5+ Ke7 {That's it: now the B is targeteable, my K is safe, and the threat to c2 is still to be met. I'm not sure about the whole idea, but it seems to survive this present test. } 18. c3 a6 {I thought that the resulting pawn's formation will favour me, creating a wall slow to penetrate for white. } 19. cxb4 axb5 {If white goes a4 now,  Qxb4 and I believe I can hold the position, but no time to get deep into it. As an expert, some chessplayer can say at once if black's front is defendable or not. I fear it is not (by intuition), but I hoped I could this time. } 20. a3 {White goes passive, I thought Qe2 or something would be played. } Rc7 {As someone wrote shortly ago: "no nonsense strategy". } 21. Rc1 Rhc8 22. Rxc7+ Qxc7 {As I suspected, white's pawns are more vulnerable than mine. He has lost a tempo by not moving the Q, and now he will suffer for it. } 23. Qd3 Qc4 24. Qxc4 Rxc4 {Still the same principle: after this move, white has very few moves, while bxc would have been less clear.} 25. Ne5 {Oh, this N here. He does nothing. See.} Rc2 {I threaten the pawn, but I'd allow Rc1. } 26. Rb1 {f3 would have been indicated. I can't take or Rc1 and some painful penetration can happen to me. } Ne4 {With a lot of threats...} 27. b3 {I didn't play N or Rxf2. From f2 it has nowhere to go to. And my R is well placed on c, I won't take it away from there for a pawn. Moreover, I have f6 in my sleeve.} Nd2 {White has to give me the pawn without any positional loss on my side. } 28. Rd1 Nxb3 {Funnily, I trheat Nxd4, since the WR has to cover the back rank. } 29. f3 {This solves a problem but creates another: a N hunt. } f6 30. Ng6+ Kf7 31. Nf4 g5 32. Nh3 {N dislodged and far from the action. } Rd2 {c1 is covered, so if I exchange Rs my N will take d4 and the game will be over. } 33. Rb1 {Desperate. } Nxd4 34. Nf2 Ne2+ 35. Kf1 Nf4 {My N has plenty of squares. I'm not sure about this, because it allows Rc1. But Nc3, Rc1, d5 looked dangerous. I can still throw the game away.} 36. Rc1 Nd3 {I will give some pawns, but I'll keep enough ones to win. } 37. Nxd3 Rxd3 38. Rc7+ Kg6 39. Rc6 Rxa3 40. Rxb6 {I'd be late to save the last pawn, but I can create some pressure on white. } d4 41. Rxe6 {This makes another pawn, but...} Kf5 {Gives me entry for the K. } 42. Rd6 d3 43. Ke1 Ke5 44. Rd8 {now I can lose the h pawn, but white will be severely injured. } Kf4 45. Kd2 Rb3 {Rxd3, Rxb5. } 46. Rd4+ Ke5 47. Re4+ Kd5 {If Re8, Kc4. } 48. Re3 Rxb4 {I can exchange now the pawns with no danger. } 49. Rxd3+ Rd4 {The coup of grace. Now the endgame is an easy win for black. }
