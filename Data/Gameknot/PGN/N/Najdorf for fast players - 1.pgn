1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Najdorf} h6 7. Bxf6 exf6 {exf must be wrong: d pawn is completely isolated. gxf is much better.} 8. Bc4 {white is much more advanced and well centered. no merit: all the credit to black's bad moves.} Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. f4 {already planning the attack: white has to take profit of this advance.} Nc6 11. f5 {blocking almost everything here, for black side.} Qb6 {surprise?} 12. Nd5 {well, try me... If Qxd4+ then 13. Qxd4 Nxd4 14 Nxe7+, white is still better.} Qd8 13. c3 {avoiding another surprise.} Ne5 {well positionned. } 14. Bb3 {I still need my white clear bishop.} b5 15. Rf4 {let's continue our plan.} Bb7 16. Rh4 Bxd5 {?!} 17. Bxd5 Ra7 18. Qe2 {allowing Ra1 to join the battlefield} Qb6 {surprise is back.} 19. Kh1 b4 20. Qf2 bxc3 21. bxc3 Qc5 22.

Rc1 {I keep my soldiers} Ng4 29. Rf3 {avoiding Nf2} Ne5 30. Rg3 {avoiding repetition} Rb8 31. h3 {avoiding other surprises} Rb2 32. Kg1 {preparing endgame...} Rc5 33. Nb3 {here, Rxa2 would be wrong because of Nxc5, of course.} Rc7 34. Re3 {this is a mistake... fortunately without huge consequences} Rxa2 35. Ra1 {simplifying to give credit to my bishop} Rxa1+ 36. Nxa1 {only problem: my knight is far from the center. } g6 {good move: trying to liberate the king.} 37. Kf2 {well i move mine.} gxf5 {three little pigs...} 38. exf5 h5 {freeing the king} 39. Ke2 Kh6 40. h4 {blocking the king, but allowing Ng4.} Rc5 41. Bb3 {keeping an eye on f7 and c4.} a5 {trying to capitalize its only good pawn.} 42. Nc2 {it gave me the time to finally come back.} Ng4 {see move 40} 43. Rg3 {only move to avoid repetition or loss.} Re5+ {oh! well, then...} 44. Ne3 {...let's simplify!} Nxe3 45. Rxe3 Rxf5 46. Bxf7 {And now, nothing can stop me any more... As black, I wouldn't have dared to continue...} a4 {but elder does...} 47. c4 Re5 {last trap! but I didn't panic} 48. Rxe5 fxe5 {looks like a4 has a freeway?} 49. Ke3 {well, let's give him a hope, then...} a3 50. c5 {surprise!} dxc5 {2 pawns for a piece... would it be sufficient?} 51. Ke4 {2 pawns? no! one, at best!} Kg7 52. Bc4 Kf6 53. g3 {zugzwanf for black} Kg6 54. Kxe5 {gnap!} Kh6 55. Kf5 {zugzwang again} Kh7 56. Kg5 Kg7 57. Ba2 {tempo to avoid Kxh5 Kf6 which could prolong the game.} Kh7 58. Kxh5 Kg7 59. g4 {Now i don't care anymore about Kf6} Kh7 {and still not resigning!!!} 60. Kg5 Kg7 61. h5 Kh7 62. Kf6 Kh8 63. g5 {I don't get it, because with as much time as I have to think and avoid a draw, it sounds... offensive to continue.} Kh7 64. g6+ Kh8 65. g7+ Kh7 66. g8=Q+ {finally resigns... Not a word, not a hi, nothing. I won't play him again, unless forced in a tournament.}
