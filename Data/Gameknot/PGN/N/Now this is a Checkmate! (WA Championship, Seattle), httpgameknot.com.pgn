1. e4 {A beautiful game by Ignacio Perez, from Cuba. This game was played in the 2007 WA State Chess Championship, which Perez eventually won! } d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. f3 c6 5. a4 Bg7 6. Be3 O-O 7. Qd2 e5 8. O-O-O Qa5 9. h4 {I love white's suicidal pawn! Wonderful attacks to black's king-side begin with this move.} h5 {Black doesn't like the idea, but...} 10. g4 {...white sends another suicidal bomb!} hxg4 {white's soldier is dead, but black's position is opening.} 11. h5 {Here goes the other one!} gxh5 {White is two pawns down but black's king-side is weakening...} 12. dxe5 Qxe5 13. Bf4 Qa5 14. Bxd6 Rd8 15. e5 {elegant!} Ne8 16. Bd3 Nxd6 17. exd6 Na6 {Not 17...Rxd6, as 18.Bh7  would win black's rook.} 18. Nge2 {White seems to be giving pawns away everywhere, but these are very subtle moves preparing for an eventual sudden assault.} gxf3 19. Nf4 Bg4 20. Rdg1 {Now that white's rooks are connected, they can freely move to properly position for an attack.} f2 {I would guess that black is deflecting white's queen, probably for a potential 21...Bxc3 or something...} 21. Qxf2 Rxd6 22. Qg3 Qe5 {fishy...} 23. Kb1 {Avoiding a possible pinning of the knight on f4 with Bh6 } Nb4 24. Rge1 Qf6 25. Bh7+ {This is the beginning of a beautiful mating combination by Ignacio Perez. } Kf8 26. Rhf1 Qh6 27. Ng6+ {! when chess becomes art! } Rxg6 {Tal once said something like "your opponent cannot take all your pieces at once, but one at a time!".} 28. Rxf7+ {! } Kxf7 29. Qc7+ Kf6 30. Qe5+ Kf7 31. Qe7# {Beautiful game! Ignacio Perez was WA State Champion on 2007, and finished second in this year's (2008) WA State Championship, behind Grandmaster Gregory Serper. }
