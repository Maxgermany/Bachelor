1. d4 d5 2. c4 {So it starts with a Queen's Gambit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Gambit} c6 {He plays the Slav variation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 {This is all very conventional and usual.} Bf5 {But this is a bit unusual. According to the Gameknot World Database, 4....e6 is most common followed by dxc4, a6 and g6, with this coming in next. To be honest it threw me a bit.} 5. Bg5 {I'm trying to play it like a normal Queen's Gambit. I later found out that this too, is the 5th most popular move, after 5. e3, cxd5, Qb3 or g3. It doesn't score very well, and will not repeat it.} e6 {This seems logical.} 6. e3 {And from me too.} Be7 {This is sensible development.} 7. Ne5 {This may be a mistake. It is not on the world database, but it is on the database of games played on Gameknot. There it does score 4 wins out of 4 for white!} Nbd7 {So he continues to develop.} 8. f4 {This is probably over-optimistic too, although it has been successfully played in the Gameknot game, anyhumanheart (1649) vs. zorakblaster (1658), which continued with Nxe5 9. dxe5 Ne4 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 11. Nxe4 Bxe4 12. cxd5 Bxd5?? which lost the bishop after 12. cxd5 Bxd5 13. Qc2 O-O 14. Bd3 Kh8 15. O-O h6 16. e4. Any other pawn capture on move 12 leads to similar positions to the game, and presumably, an edge for black.} h6 {This is another good move by black. I probably should have started exchanging minor pieces now.} 9. Bh4 {But I stubbornly played this. } Ne4 {And he starts exchanging.} 10. Bxe7 {So I take his bishop.} Qxe7 {He takes back.} 11. Nxe4 {I take his knight on e4.} Bxe4 {And he takes back. This bishop is a monster. I am probably best exchanging knights again, but instead I played...} 12. Qd2 Nxe5 {So he takes, and messes up my pawns.} 13. fxe5 {It may have been better to take back the other way.} O-O {He castles. Now I want to play Bd3, but I thought that if I did, he could exchange on d3 and then check with the queen on b4 and he seems to be winning a pawn. Maybe 14. 0-0-0 was best now? But instead I played...} 14. cxd5 {To prepare Bd3.} exd5 {But the problem now is I am going to be weak along the e file.} 15. Bd3 {So I continue with my plan.} Bxd3 {He takes.} 16. Qxd3 {I take back.} f6 {Virtually forcing a very favourable exchange of pawns.} 17. exf6 {So I take.} Rxf6 {He takes back.} 18. O-O-O {I finally castle.} Rf2 {But now I have this rook to deal with.} 19. Rd2 {So I seek to exchange it. Round about here I offered a draw, which he correctly turned down.} Raf8 {He backed up the rook.} 20. h4 {I wanted to stop his queen coming in to h4} Rxd2 {He exchanges.} 21. Qxd2 {I take back.} Qe4 {And his queen takes up a very powerful position.} 22. b3 {I think this was played with the idea of making my king safer on b2.} Rf6 {Rook comes up - it is very hard for white.} 23. Rh2 {I play this to make g2-g3 possible.} Rg6 {He prevents that move.} 24. Qf2 {I am "threatening" g-g3 again.} Rf6 {He hits my queen.} 25. Qe1 {In a hard position, I go wrong again. Qe2 or d2 was better.} Qd3 {With the horrible threat of Rf1} 26. Rh1 {I think this is the only way to defend against it.} Re6 {And now there is no way white can defend against all the threats.} 27. Rh3 {I try to protect the e pawn. I was hoping he wouldn't see the next move.} Qxd4 {But is did. I could almost resign here.} 28. Kb1 {As good or bad as anything.} Qd3+ {He throws in a check.} 29. Kb2 {King up.} d4 {Again, using the pin on the e file.} 30. e4 {Hoping to confuse him.} Qxe4 {But he continues to play well.} 31. Qg3 {Hoping for some sort of counter-attack.} Qe2+ {He checks again.} 32. Kb1 {King drops back.} Rf6 {Threatening Rf1 again.} 33. Qb8+ {I throw in a spite check. I was preparing to reign if he played Rf8.} Kh7 {But for once he missed the best move, but it doesn't change the outcome.} 34. Rf3 {I stop the mate in one!} Rxf3 {He takes.} 35. gxf3 {I take back.} d3 {There is no stopping this pawn.} 36. Qf4 {I hope for a perpetual.} Qc2+ {He throws in a check.} 37. Ka1 {King scurries to the corner.} d2 {And I resigned. Many thanks for reading this. Please rate it on the star system, and leave a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!}
