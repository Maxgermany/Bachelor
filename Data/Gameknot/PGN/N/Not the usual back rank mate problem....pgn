1. e4 {This game had some interesting features, with real threats looming against both black and white through out the game. What I really wanted to show was an interesting position involving a back rank mate threat that ended the game,  but not the kind of end one normally thinks about...} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6 5. Qd2 {Sort of like the Sicilian without the c5, the game did have the Sicilian feel though, with white attacking on the king side and black on the queen side.} Nd7 6. O-O-O b5 7. Nf3 Bb7 8. d5 Ngf6 9. Bd3 c5 10. dxc6 e.p. {Now it looks like one has transposed in a Sicillian.} Bxc6 11. Nd4 Bb7 12. f3 {This is a personal favourite when playing against the Sicilian. } Rc8 13. g4 Qa5 14. Kb1 {Need to guard this now because of b4 and then Qxh2} Ne5 15. h4 {This is the standard Sicilian race of both colours towards the king, such games are often exciting, especially if the race is close.} b4 16. Nce2 Nc4 {I think this was not the best move for black, the white squared bishop does not have much space and in these cramped positions exchanging a bishop for a knight is not a bad deal.} 17. Bxc4 Rxc4 18. Qd3 {I was hoping for a castle king side and only then play Bh6. My opponent was not obliging though.} Rc8 19. Ng3 h5 20. g5 {I think I should have played gxh5 here, however I was afraid it would bring blacks rook out to join the attack on my queen side, while the black king was still safe in the center.} Nd7 21. Rhf1 {The intent to open up on the f file is clear now.} Nc5 22. Qd2 Na4 {The black knight is threatening where it is, Nc3+ is something I always have to look out for, especially if there is a rook on g8.} 23. f4 {The race is on towards the king.} O-O 24. f5 Bxd4 {I think this might have been a mistake, the black bishop is a useful defensive piece and can play a big role in black plans against the white queen side.} 25. Bxd4 Rc4 {Black is trying to double up rooks, I at first thought that this was too dangerous, since the black king side is about to be opened up.} 26. fxg6 fxg6 27. Rxf8+ {I had a look at this game on the computer afterward and Qd3 was the move that would have given white a big advantage, with the threat of Qxg6+ looming.} Kxf8 28. Qd3 {Now Qd3 is not as good as before since the king can now escape easier towards the center.} Qb5 {The correct move from black since leaving the rook on c4 means that the bishop is vulnerable and does not allow white queen to go straight for the black king.} 29. Rf1+ Ke8 {King going to g8 would be suicide.} 30. e5 {To open up for the queen on g6} dxe5 31. Qxg6+ Kd8 32. Be3 {The bishop is hanging and must be moved, there is no immediate mate threat against the black king.} Rxh4 {This move caught me by surprise, my first reaction was that black needs to care about his king, but this move does now make back rank mates a possibility if I am not careful.} 33. Rf8+ Kc7 34. Qe6 {Now either the pawns on e7 or e5 will fall.} Nc3+ {A dangerous move, if white plays gxc3 then rips open the position and the king is in big trouble.} 35. Ka1 {The back rank problem is now worse since playing Bc1 later will not save the king.} Nd5 36. Qxe5+ {Objectively the computer says that ba7 is the best move, something I cannot ever see myself, this was almost a frustrating position for white, as I knew I had push something devastating, but could not see it.} Kd7 37. Bc1 {I did not want lose the bishop to the knight, also I played this for any future back rank problems where the bishop already on c1 would make the difference. Again ba7 was the better move as it would have provided useful threats coming from a bishop on b8.} Qb6 38. Rb8 {Threatens Qxd5+ and then Rxb6, this move however is a bad move from white, since it allows black to improve its chances. Qb8 is the better move.} Qc7 {Now whites attack does not look good anymore, exchanging queens will not give white any meaningful endgame, not exchanging means that the rook and knight are forked.} 39. Qf5+ {I decided to go on a king hunt, strictly speaking, there is no way white can force the position into anything dangerous for the black king since the white king is also at risk of a back rank mate.} Kc6 40. Qe6+ Kc5 {Seeing the king of c5 should be normally be very bad for black, again the computer says otherwise, this position is drawn !} 41. Be3+ {During the game I was hoping this would eventually open up the king where it could not escape some dangerous mating net.} Nxe3 42. Qxe3+ Kb5 {While this move is not strictly speaking bad, it was actually a kind of mistake for black as will be seen in a few moves...} 43. Rf8 {Ok this is where I played more of a poker move rather than chess (remember we were not grandmasters playing here). This was a little trap I thought black might fall for, while this is not normally how I decide my move, in the context of the very dangerous back rank threat it was worth a try.} Qxg3 {This move was what I was hoping for, this queen sacrifice at first looks like white is lost, since Qxg3 Rh1+ Rf1 Rxf1 mate. Even if white does not take the queen the material advantage and the back rank problem means it is over. Unfortunately black missed the next move.} 44. a4+ {This is what black failed to see when he played Qxg3. This move provides white with the escape hatch that frees the king and still lets it win the queen hanging on g3. While objectively this was not a back rank combination, it is an interesting scenario where the back threat against oneself can actually be used as an advantage.  Thanks for reading my annotations.} bxa3 e.p. 45. Qxg3 Rh1+ 46. Ka2 Bd5+ {kxa3 Ra1 mate !} 47. b3 {}
