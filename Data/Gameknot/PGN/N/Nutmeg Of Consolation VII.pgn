1. d4 {I chose to annotate this game because i played better in it, in terms of sacrifices and maintaining my agressive stance than in any other game i've played... Although i'll admit i made some mistakes as well .... I'm playing black  Big thanks to my opponent lethalia for the fun game} Nf6 2. h3 {not a very agressive second move, i think this negates most of his advantage as white.... a recurrant theme for white in the beginning of this game seems to be defensive moves} d5 3. Bf4 Nc6 4. e3 e6 5. a3 {looks like my knights arn't going anywhere anytime very agressive anytime soon} Bd6 {the advantage for white of his pawn structure severly limits my dark bishop ... so i offer to trade for his} 6. Bh2 {offer declined.... but in such a way as to prevent a break in his pawn structure} Ne4 {what was i thinking here? if he plays f3, i have to retreat, but the knight on his kingside will only be able to go to e2, perhaps i should have made a more agressive decision} 7. Nf3 Bxh2 {i should have traded bishops before making that last move in order to prevent him from castling and to cause him to waste a move getting his rook back to his back rank.... hindsight is 20 20} 8. Nxh2 Qf6 {i want to position my queen activly on the kingside but i don't choose a very good spot} 9. Ng4 {good move by white... i obviously chose the wrong square for that queen last move} Qf5 10. Be2 {better might be d3 to pin my knight to my queen } b6 11. O-O {at this point i think my pieces are slightly more active but i don't really have a difinative plan to penetrate his defences} h5 {i was trying to force his knight to h2... } 12. f3 {i see where he is going with this.... } hxg4 13. fxg4 {ah.... discovered attack on my queen and opening a file kingside..... thing is i haven't castled yet....  I really expected fxe4! here, with the same dicovered attack.... he could have followed that up with Bx4 to prevent me from fully opening the H file} Qg5 {i had 4 moves to choose from and i've got vague plans of attacking along the h file} 14. Rf3 Bb7 15. Qf1 f6 16. Ba6 Bxa6 17. Qxa6 Na5 {this move loses a pawn if white plays Qb7, but i couldn't fid a better continuation.... his move had suprised me as it seemed he was planning an attack kingside} 18. Qe2 O-O-O {this is probably not a good idea but i know that he can't mate me with just his queen and i'm planning a big attack on kingside .... i figure if his queen is distracted long enough..... } 19. Qa6+ Kb8 {i was planning Kb8 anyways.... distraction achieved} 20. b4 {looks like he is going to counterattack on queenside} Nb7 {Nc6 is answered by b5 so this was my only logical move} 21. c4 {my king is starting to sweat a little... i debated dxc4 but decided that i didn't want to open a file for his rooks} Qh4 {to clear the g5 space for my knight, as i plan to sack the knight for the h3 pawn (the rook will move when i play Ng5).... i think this gives me more than adequate compensation for the knight and i really want to draw his attention away from intensifying his queenside attack } 22. c5 {my king is sweating even more.... i thought for a long time about bxc6 but white would logically respond with bxc6 and my king would be in a very bad positoin... in case of C6 i plan to play Nd6} Ng5 23. Rf1 Nxh3+ {Knight sacrifice!} 24. gxh3 Qxh3 {his king is going to be doing a lot of running!} 25. Kf2 {forced as anything else loses to Qh1 or Qh2} Qh2+ 26. Ke1 {forced as Kf3 looses to Rh3 #} Qg3+ 27. Kd1 {no particularly good options but Kd2 saves the pawn for a move} Qxg4+ 28. Kc2 {white's best option here is probably to play Qe2 to stop the bleeding.... but he tries to run to satety because of his own attack that he wants to resume} Rh2+ {now i'll attack with both the queen and rook!} 29. Nd2 Qe4+ 30. Kb3 {he thinks his king will be safe with his queen... but.... } Qxe3+ 31. Ka4 Qxd2 {now white must guard the C2 and D1 squares .... i figure that he will try c6..... i've had Nd6 in my head as a backup plan for some time now, but if he plays c6, i can force the win of his queen and two pawns (yeah it took me a while to plan the combo and to decide what to do about that c pawn of his)} 32. c6 {its almost over now.... white may think he has escaped and is about to mate me but he is in for an unplesent suprise! } Qc2+ 33. Kb5 Qc4+ 34. Ka4 {the real point of the combo! } Qxa6+ 35. Kb3 Qc4+ {At this point white resigns.... i was planning a continuation that would grab both the c and d pawns as well as his king continued to shuffle between the two spaces.... i probably could have found a forced mate if i sacked my other knight but i'm not sure... }
