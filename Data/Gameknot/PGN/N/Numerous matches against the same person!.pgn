1. e4 {I was playing this untalented player in 2-minute chess on iwin games and he kept playing the same thing against me and he'd lose quickly. I played this EXACT same mating sequence against him at least twice, as well as other mating variations, until finally after getting mated like 20 times with different variations of the king's gambit, he stopped playing the same opening moves and I got bored of screwing around with him.} e5 {He played this in all 20 games.} 2. f4 {When I play 2-minute chess (bullet chess), I like to play complicated gambit openings since there isn't much time to think of how to defend. Another gambit opening I play in fast games is the Morra Gambit (e4 c5 d4 cxd4 c3).} exf4 {He accepted the pawn in most of the games until finally he got tired of getting mated so in the last few games he played Nc6, and then I got bored of beating him. A good way to decline the gambit is Bc5, taking advantage of the weakened diagonal.} 3. Nf3 {Now I have a lead in development, but am down a pawn. In long time control games, or correspondence games, this opening favors Black. But in very fast games, Black doesn't have enough time to find defensive resources and hold onto the pawn, unless he's a master of the King's Gambit.} g5 {Black played this move in all the variations where he accepted the pawn.} 4. Bc4 {Now I have two pieces developed, plus a pawn in the centre, while Black wasted two moves getting a free pawn.} f6 {This is a terrible move. This weakens the diagonal that my bishop is on, plus it allows my next crushing move. Black doesn't even need to defend the pawn with another piece, since his queen is already defending. Better moves for Black are Bg7, h6, and g4. Black only played this move about three times. I still brilliantly mated him when he played other moves, but those games were too long to remember and the terrible player made lots of mistakes.} 5. Nxg5 {I played this sacrifice against him three times, which is totally crushing. Black will lose much faster if he accepts the piece sacrifice, but if he declines it (like in one of the games) then I have so many tactical threats it's not funny. Black should resign now since he is totally lost. In one of the games, Black actually played 5...Ne7 here and I played 6.Bf7# I'm serious. This guy was that terrible.} fxg5 {Now I have a forced mate here. Black's only chance was to decline the sacrifice, defend like crazy, and hope to beat me on time.} 6. Qh5+ {Black has weakened his kingside so much trying to hold onto the pawn, that I can exploit him by chasing his king into the centre. } Ke7 {Forced.} 7. Qf7+ {Black's king is helpless. Qxg5  might still be winning, but why complicate the game when I have an incredibly simple checkmate?} Kd6 {Black has no pieces developed, and his king has been hunted onto the third rank. His unmoved pawns on the queenside make it so Black cannot escape back to the back rank. This position occured many times in my games with this very horrible player. And I mated him in the EXACT same way. What a terrible player.} 8. Qd5+ {Can you see the mate yet?} Ke7 {I could get a draw by perpetual check with Qf7  Qd5  etc., but there is a very simple mate in 1 here.} 9. Qe5# {This is checkmate, not to mention I'm forking Black's king and rook.}
