1. Nf3 {NB Open 2007.} c5 2. g3 d6 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. O-O e5 5. d3 Be7 6. e4 {My favorite...the KIA.  It isn't all that strong against Sicilians without black playing e6 but at least it is solid and avoids the 'book lines' most Sicilian players hope to reach.} Bg4 7. h3 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Nf6 9. Nc3 a6 10. Bg5 Nd7 11. Bxe7 Nxe7 {I think he captured with the knight so he could get rid of the knight I am about to put on the d5 outpost.  However, in doing so I am able to capture his knight with my e pawn.   That pawn will be almost impossible to remove.  Once he pushes his b and f pawns I'll have an outpost on c6 and more importantly on e6.  It takes me a while to plop a piece on e6 but I do. } 12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 O-O 14. c4 {I liked this pawn formation.  It is solid.  } f5 15. Bg2 Rf6 16. Qh5 {I'm hoping to provoke some pawn weaknesses.} Nf8 17. Qg5 h6 18. Qd2 Ng6 19. b4 {Black is still quite solid on the kingside so now I probe the Queenside a bit.} b6 20. a4 a5 21. bxa5 Rxa5 22. Rfb1 {I liked this move and I don't think my opponent expected it. } f4 {22...f4?  I was waiting for this pawn to move for a long time.} 23. Be4 {His position is starting to have lots of holes.  It's time to bring the bishop to life and expolit those outposts!} Ra6 24. Kh2 {I saw a 'neat tactical trap' so I played a poor move hoping he'd fall for it.  I should really stop doing that so often!  Now my king is less active and less able to aid in defence.  } fxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qf8 26. Kg2 Ne7 27. Rbf1 Nc8 28. Rxf6 Qxf6 29. Rf1 {Gaining the file.} Qd8 30. Bf5 {Now that I own the file I can reposition the bishop even deeper into his camp.  Destination...e6.} Ne7 31. Be6+ Kh8 32. Rf7 {Attacking the g pawn.} Rxa4 33. Qd1 {The d1/h5 diagonal is calling my name.} Ra2+ 34. Kg1 g5 {34..g5??  And that's one hole too many.} 35. Qh5 Ra1+ 36. Kf2 Ra2+ 37. Ke3 Ng8 38. Qg6 {Black resigned here.  I'm happy with my play in this game.  I suppose I should really pick up the white side of the Sicilian since the KIA isn't as effective against Sicilians without e6 by Black.  All comments are welcome.}
