1. e4 {Another game OTB annotated by me.  I'm white by our draw, As always e4!  } b6 2. d4 {Staking claim to the center.} d5 3. exd5 {Begging her royal highness to enter the middle.} Qxd5 4. Be2 {seeking a devious plot to overthrow her regime...} e5 5. Bf3 e4 6. Nc3 {I figure why not?  At least get the pawn out of the deal, plus chase 'er around a bit!} Qb7 7. Bxe4 c6 8. Bf4 {I had another plot cooking where I would move my N to b5, he wouldn't be able to take with the pawn on c6.  Then I'd move my N to fork on c7} Qe7 9. Nf3 {hoping to castle and stick his queen on the e file} Bg4 10. O-O Nf6 11. Bxc6+ Nxc6 12. Re1 Ne5 {In retrospect, he decides quickly this wasn't his best move, B-e6 was better.} 13. Rxe5 Be6 {Which he now does.} 14. d5 Rd8 15. Qd3 Qb4 16. Qb5+ Nd7 17. Qxb4 Bxb4 18. Re4 Bxc3 19. bxc3 O-O 20. dxe6 fxe6 21. Rxe6 {it wasn't until after I moved this piece did I see that he could take with his R.  And he apparently didn't see it either...apparently fluster by what has transpired.  But it doesn't matter, he gets it later.} Nc5 22. Rd6 Ne4 23. Rxd8 Rxd8 24. c4 Nc3 25. Ne5 {DUMB DUMB DUMB by me.  Now I'm in for a royal forking.} Ne2+ 26. Kf1 Nxf4 27. Nc6 Rd2 28. g3 Ne6 29. Re1 Nd4 30. Ne5 {Prior to this move I noticed a potential mate on the back row.  I just needed the N to guard the f7 square and get my rook up there...So I let him take the c2 pawn so I can attack his N with my R.  Hoping he'll just move his N and I go up for #} Rxc2 31. Rd1 {good so far...} Re2 {foiled!  He noticed it at the last second. } 32. Rxd4 Rxe5 33. Rd8+ Kf7 34. Rd7+ Re7 35. Rxe7+ Kxe7 {We concluded to draw.  Neither of us were sure if we could win outright, plus we were on time constraints.  We finished the game, but played more or less like speed chess.  It ended nicely though in my favour. :)   See as follows:} 36. f4 Kd6 37. Ke2 Kc5 38. Kd3 a5 39. a3 b5 40. cxb5 Kxb5 41. f5 Ka4 42. g4 Kxa3 43. g5 Kb2 44.
