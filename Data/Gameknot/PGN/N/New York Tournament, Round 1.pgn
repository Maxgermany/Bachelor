[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C89), Marshall counter-attack, 11...c6"]

1. e4 {Later in his career Capablanca switched to 1. d4} e5 {Marshall copies the opening move.} 2. Nf3 {Capa plays his usual follow-up.} Nc6 {"My first surprise," wrote Capa.  (Marshall allows the Ruy Lopez for the first time in nearly a decade)} 3. Bb5 {Capa plays his favourite Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening.} a6 {The Morphy Defense, named after Paul Charles Morphy (June 22, 1837 – July 10, 1884), an American chess player. He is considered to have been the greatest chess master of his era.} 4. Ba4 {Capa drops the bishop back.} Nf6 {Marshall attacks the e pawn.} 5. O-O {Capa ignores the attack.} Be7 {Black continues to develop, opting for what is usually known as the closed variation, rather than the open variation with Nxe4. The game doesn't remain very closed for long though!} 6. Re1 {Capa protects the e pawn.} b5 {Black attacks the bishop now, otherwise white will play c3 and drop the bishop back to c2.} 7. Bb3 {So the bishop drops back.} O-O {Marshall castles. He thought, incorrectly, that this was a novelty. Capa commented "‘Castling has been supposed to be undesirable at this point, on account of 8 Bd5." - which rather begs the question - "why didn't Capa play 8. Bd5 then, if he thought it was so good?" Capa himself answers "I now felt that Marshall had prepared something for me, expecting me to play B-Q5 (Bd5), therefore without hesitation I played my next move."} 8. c3 {White prepares d2-d4. this move is still the most commonly played move here, although some prefer other moves, one of which, 8. a4 is now known as the Anti-Marshall.} d5 {Marshall plays his gambit. Capa commented "The sacrifice, if accepted, yields Black a powerful attack, although of a doubtful nature, and I am inclined to think that White should come out with advantage." I think for a long time the chess world agreed with this analysis. Growing up in the 1960s and 1970s I remember reading an article in the magazine "Chess" about a refutation to this gambit. Yet today many players consider it sound and play it. Opening databases show that results with it are similar to other defences to the Roy Lopez. Currently, Armenian Grandmaster Levon Aronian is one of the main advocates for the Marshall Attack.} 9. exd5 {Capa takes.} Nxd5 {Marshall takes back.} 10. Nxe5 {Capa wins his pawn. "I thought for a little while before playing this, knowing I would be subjected there-after to a terrific attack, all the lines of which would be of necessity be familiar to my adversary. The lust of battle, however, had been aroused within me. I felt that my judgement and skill were being challenged by a player who had reason to fear both, (as shown by the records of our previous encounters); but who wanted to take advantage of the element of surprise and of the fact of my being unfamiliar with a thing to which he had devoted many a night of toil and  hard work. I considered the position then and decided I was in honour bound, so to speak, to take the Pawn and accept the challenge ... as my knowledge and judgement told me that my position should then be defensible."   -  Jose R. Capablanca.  ( From his great book, "My Chess Career." ) } Nxe5 {Black exchanges knights.} 11. Rxe5 {White takes back.} Nf6 {Re-positioning this important minor piece. This was Marshall's original idea, but is considered  "passé" by most opening books today. The "Modern" Variation of,  "The Marshall Attack,"  is 11...c6 and is the usual move at this point. Marshall himself found this improvement.} 12. Re1 {"White's move order is slightly unusual, but it transposes into the more natural sequence 12. d4 Bd6 13. Re1 (Today Re2 is considered equally strong) 13...Ng4 14. h3 Qh4 15. Qf3" Dr John Nunn in the excellent book "The World's Greatest Chess Games" 1998. "12 d4 looks like the natural move, but leads to the same thing." - Capablanca.} Bd6 {Black re-positions his bishop. taking aim at the black king-side.} 13. h3 {"If 13 d4, then will follow 13...Ng4." - Capa} Ng4 {Black plays it anyway! "The onslaught begins."  -  J.R. Capablanca. "Black's attack gathers momentum."  -  GM J. Nunn.  He goes on to note that White has no minor pieces defending his King, and that White's entire Q-side is still at home. He notes that the Black attack looks extremely dangerous and maybe the only reason White survives is because of perfect defence - and the fact that White's Queen and light-squared bishop - prove to be a very effective combination of defensive units. "The knight can't be taken, 14.hxg4? Qh4 15.Qf3! Bh2+!; 16.Kf1 Bxg4 17.Qe4 Bf4; 18.g3 Qh2 and White will lose his Queen under unfavourable     conditions."  - GM J. Nunn.} 14. Qf3 {This move is both offensive and defensive, as it threatens the rook on a1 and also protects the white kingside. } Qh4 {Black continues with the most aggressive continuation.} 15. d4 {"Intuitive, and absolutely correct."  -  GM Reuben Fine. "The tempting move of 15 Re8 is met by 15...Bb7 16 Rxf8+ Rxf8 17 Qxg4 Re8 18 Kf1 Qe7 19 Be6 Bd5, and Black has the best of it." - Capablanca.} Nxf2 {"The trapper, trapped." -  J.R.C.  "Very likely a mistake and overlooking the reply. 15...h5 was perhaps the best way to keep up the pressure." Black had nothing better, according to Capablanca.   Capa says Black had, " ... to go on with the attack ... or die."  Interestingly in the opening databases I use I can't find any other moves being successfully used by Black in this position. Fritz seems to think it is the best move. "Again White cannot take the knight. 16. Qxf2 Bh2+ (But not 16...Bg3?? 17. Qxf7) 17. Kf1 Bg3 18. Qe2(now 18. Qxf7+ Rxf7+ is check) Bxh3 19. gxh3 Rae8 20. Be3 Bxe1 21. Qxe1 Qxh3+ 23. Kf1 Qxb2 and wins" - Dr. John Nunn.} 16. Re2 {"A strong move, but decades of analysis have shown that the most convincing refutation of Black's play is 16. Bd2!" (Dr John Nunn). 16. Bd2 is indeed the most popular move on my opening databases. 16. Re2 is third most popular behind 16. Qxf2, although that move loses, as explained above. "One can hardly criticize Capablanca's move since after it White retains a clear advantage no matter how Black plays." (Dr John Nunn).  "The tempting move of 15 Re8 is met by 15...Bb7 16 Rxf8+ Rxf8 17 Qxg4 Re8 18 Kf1 Qe7 19 Be6 Bd5, and Black has the best of it." Capablanca.} Bg4 {Black keeps attacking, giving white a choice of taking bishop or knight. Of course there are other moves available.  Nxh3+ 17. gxh3 Bxh3 18. Re4 is given as "hopeless by Dr John Nunn, and in my opening database I can see White scoring 66% with this.} 17. hxg4 {Capa took the bishop.} Bh2+ {Marshall threw in the check.} 18. Kf1 {The reply is of course forced.} Bg3 {Protecting the knight and threatening mate in one. "The alternative was 18...Nh1, leading to a complicated game, but always White is apparently able to find a valid defence." Capablanca} 19. Rxf2 {"19 Ke1 was also feasible, as it is not possible for Black to play 19...Rae8 on account of 20 Qxf7+" - Capablanca.  Capablanca though 19. Ke1 was playable, but Nh3+ 20. Kd1	Ng1 21. Qe4 Nxe2 22. Qxe2 Rae8 23.	Qf3 Qh1+ 24. Kc2 Qe1 25.	Bd2 Re2 gives Black more counterplay than in the game." Dr John Nunn.} Qh1+ {Black throws in another check.} 20. Ke2 {Forced again.} Bxf2 {Black regains some of the sacrificed material.} 21. Bd2 {White saves his threatened bishop. 21. Kxf2 Qxc1 22. Qe2 Rae8 23. Qd2 Qh1 has been tried in some Internet games, but black still has an attack, but after 21. Bd2 white gradually consolidates.} Bh4 {The only way to save the bishop.} 22. Qh3 {Of course White would love to exchange queens and consolidate his extra material.} Rae8+ {"As it is important for Black to avoid exchanging queens he is now compelled to drive the king to c2 and presently also his rooks are on the wrong side of the board." Capablanca.} 23. Kd3 {23. Be3? would be a suicidal self-pin.} Qf1+ {The only way to prevent the queen exchange and not lose the Bishop on h4.} 24. Kc2 {Forced - but the white king at last finds some sanctuary. } Bf2 {Keeping the bishop active} 25. Qf3 {An interesting pin on the bishop.} Qg1 {Which Marshall immediately breaks. } 26. Bd5 {"This move is one of those inconspicuous but important moves which make the difference between a smooth technical victory and allowing the opponent messy counterplay. After 26. a4? Be3!; 27. Bxe3 Rxe3;  28. Nd2!? Qxa1; 29. Qxe3 bxa4;  30. Bd5 a3 we have the mess, whereas after the text-move, which threatens 27. Qd1, Black's compensation is far more limited." Dr John Nunn.} c5 {Black tries to open up the c file.} 27. dxc5 {White takes.} Bxc5 {Black takes back.} 28. b4 {White attacks the Bishop.} Bd6 {Which drops back. "If, instead, 28...Be3 29 Bxe3 Rxe3 30 Nd2!" Capablanca. } 29. a4 {The best, according to several players.  "Incredibly ingenious, the Rook enters the game via the Queen's - Rook file."  -  GM R. Fine.  "Rescue of the Rook."  -  Tartakower  and  DuMont.  "White finally brings his a1-rook into play." -  GM J. Nunn} a5 {Black continues to try and confuse the issue, hoping to throw the queen-side open.} 30. axb5 {White takes.} axb4 {Black takes.} 31. Ra6 {The rook gets into action, attacking the Bishop.} bxc3 {Marshall, typically, ignores it and goes on his own attack.} 32. Nxc3 {White takes.} Bb4 {"White's king has been stripped of its defensive pawn-cover, but Black's pieces are in no position to make use of this. Indeed, there is little he can do to stop the b-pawn." Dr John Nunn.} 33. b6 {White advances.} Bxc3 {Black takes.} 34. Bxc3 {White takes back.} h6 {Black creates an escape square for his king.} 35. b7 {Not only pushing the pawn towards promotion, if necessary, but also opening up the 6th rank for his rook on a6 to use.} Re3 {One last attack.} 36. Bxf7+ {Black resigns. The end would be:  36.Bxf7+ Rxf7;    (Or 36...Kh8?!; 37.Rxh6#!             Or 36...Kh7;  37.Qf5+ Kh8;  38.Rxh6#.)    37.b8Q+ Kh7;     (Or 37...Re8;          38.Qxe8+ Kh7;  39.Qee4+ g6;  40.Qxg6#.  Line by - GM R. Fine.)          38.Rxh6+! Kxh6;   (38...gxh6?!; 39.Qxf7#).    39.Qh8+ Kg5;         40.Qh5#   -  main line (here)  by GM Andrew Soltis and GM J Nunn.)  Many thanks for reading.
