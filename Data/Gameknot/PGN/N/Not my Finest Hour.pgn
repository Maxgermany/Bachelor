1. e4 {Team Match, not my finest hour, so there's no great insight here; just a lesson in what not to do. I'm playing white and open with the Open Game.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Black hit me up with the Philidor, an opening that wasn't very well appreciated in my tournament days in the 80s, but seems to have renewed vigor here two decades later. White responds with the main line.} exd4 4. Nxd4 {Main Line.} Bd7 5. Nc3 {I haven't seen 4. ... Bd7 yet. Doesn't seem threatening, so white just plays along with the main line and pretends black did too.} Nc6 6. Bb5 {Not really sure why white played this, other than that it may have been in the DB. It invites some early exchanges but it doesn't seem to be overly advantageous.} Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Nf6 8. Bxd7+ Qxd7 9. Bg5 {Pinning the black knight to... nothing.} Be7 10. O-O-O {Naturally.} O-O 11. e5 {The black pawn on d6 is pinned so it's time to charge in and make a nuissance of myself.} Ne8 12. Bxe7 {Looks like there could be a pawn to be won here, though black can squirm out, I believe.} Qxe7 13. exd6 Nxd6 14. Nd5 {13. ... Nxd6 seems natural, but it loses a pawn. Better was 13. ... Qxd6 which seems to hold on to even material at the cost of isolating a black pawn on the d-file.} Qd7 15. Nxc7 {It's hardly worth calling it a sacrifice since white will regain the material immediately.} Qxc7 16. Qxd6 Qc4 17. Qd5 {Black avoids exchanging queens, but white is eager to eliminate material now. This move has the added advantage of defending the white pawn on a2 that was en prise and it forks the black queen and the black pawn on b7.} Qf4+ 18. Kb1 Qxf2 19. Qxb7 {A little fork of black's own keeps material even.} Rac8 20. Qe4 Rcb8 21. Qd4 {Forks the black queen and the pawn on a7. I thought surely this would force the issue, trade queens, since black wouldn't want to lose another pawn.} Qf5 22. Qxa7 {Two pawns up, heading into the end game. Surely a won position.} Rfc8 23. Qa4 {Black threatened a mate in 2.} Qe6 24. Rhe1 {Sights on e8, though not quite enough firepower on that square to make it work yet.} Qb6 25. Qd4 {Defending mate in 1. I'm beginning to wonder if I can win this position. Black has multiple powerful attacks down the half-open files at white's king, and white has no similar attacking avenues because of the very two pawns by which he ahead in material.} Qa5 26. Re3 {Black threatens the white rook on e1. It's defended, but I've been known to move the wrong rook in other games... My goal here is to get my rooks in front of my king and block the attacks on the half-open files, maybe trade some rooks while I'm at it, and maybe even triple my attack down the d-file hoping for a back-rank mate.} Qc7 27. Rc3 {And there's my blunder. 27. Rc3?? just throws away the rook for nothing. My thinking? I glanced at the position, I knew I wanted to use my rooks on the third rank to block black's files, and the rook is guarded by two pieces. Even better, after black moves his queen, white would play Rxc8 and exchange one pair of rooks. I moved too fast, completely overlooking the fact that the pawn on b2 is pinned. The position just seemed so safe, I didn't give it the attention it deserved. I hardly gave it any attention at all.} Qxc3 28. Qxc3 Rxc3 29. Kc1 {And that's it, from ahead by two pawns to down by a rook. I wonder if there's still a win, or a draw, here, banking on three adjacent pawns, supported by a rook and king. Can white promote? Can white threaten to promote strongly enough that black must give up a rook to prevent it? I played out numerous continuations from here, but I didn't find a way to force that to happen. Not much to see from this point on...} Rcc8 30. a4 Rc4 31. b3 Rc3 32. b4 {Trying to be sneaky. I'm dead anyway, might as well bait the trap. If black plays 32. ... Rxb4??? then white wins with 33. Rd8#. I know, it's too obvious, but hey, so was 27. Rc3?? and I still blew it. One can always hope for a little tit for tat.} Rc4 33. Rd3 Rcxb4 34. c3 Rxa4 35. Rg3 {Now I'm mostly just stalling. Frankly, I had a nice winning streak going and had several other games about to reach favorable conclusions (including my other match game against this opponent), thereby extending the streak. So I'm dragging my feet a bit. Hey, if black wants a quick win, he should force a quick win. Too petty? Well, until black breaks up his pawns, or at least plays Kf8, I'm still hoping he might slip up. And at least I had the courtesy to tell him directly over the e-board in the game comments.} Ra2 36. c4 Rc8 37. Kb1 Ra4 38. c5 Rxc5 39. Rb3 {One last try. Could happen... Though 39. Rd3 might have been better, but I felt it was also more obvious.} Rac4 40. Rd3 {OK, he got me. I try one more time, but black's next move seals white's doom forever more. After 40. ... g6, I have extended my winning streak enough, and exhausted all hope of pulling off a sneaky last-minute back-rank mate in this game, so I resign.} g6 {}
