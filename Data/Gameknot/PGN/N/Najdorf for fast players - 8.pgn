1. e4 {from a najdorf imposed tournament. An interessant sacrifice.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {here is the imposed line: 1.	e4	c5 2.	Nf3	d6 3.	d4	cxd4 4.	Nxd4	Nf6 5.	Nc3	a6 6.	Bg5} Nbd7 {i chose to defend with the second horse, without knowing very well this defence. I was not tempted by e5, because i don't like the line Bxf6, Qxf6, Nd5 that impose black to lose a tempo and offers nice suits for the white horses.} 7. Be2 e6 {so, e6 is much more comfortable according to me, but I played various possibilities in this tournament.} 8. O-O Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. Kh1 {since now, white has chosen a very quite version, without f4. I am glad about that. I hate f4... when i am black} h6 11. Bh4 Nc5 {let's have some action...} 12. Bd3 Nfxe4 {let's win a pawn} 13. Nxe4 Bxh4 14. Nf3 Nxe4 15. Bxe4 Bf6 {and the combination terminates with a pawn in my pocket and the pair of bishops.} 16. c4 Qb6 {good position, as the white knight is temporarily impeached by the Bf6 and white has lost his black bishop.} 17. Rab1 {to free the queen's moves.} Rd8 {mine too} 18. b3 {to free the rook's moves} d5 {let's free some space... and a trick too...} 19. cxd5 exd5 20. Bd3 {didn't fall into it: if 20. Bxd5, then Be6, would lose it. well seen, philipdor} Be6 {engaging finally bishop and rooks} 21. Qe2 {this is obscure to me} Rac8 22. Rfe1 {my bishop is well protected. His cannot arm mine... so what is the point? A long time plan trying to mate on 8th line?} Rc3 23. Rec1 {he already renounced} Rdc8 24. Rxc3 Rxc3 25. Qd2 {looks like we are waiting for the draw...} Qc7 26. Qe3 {by trying to move as less as possible, and surveyboth bishop (why not remove it??) and c1 (threatening a little bit mate), black gives me the opportunity to give back the pawn and... possibly win a piece.} d4 {will you take my poor pawn?} 27. Nxd4 {yes you did, but...} Bxd4 {... was your knight really protected? no, it was not, because, now, i threats mate in three if you take it.} 28. Qd2 {and so, the knigt has been lost...} Bf6 {get back safely...} 29. h3 {not avoinding mate yet as the queen still survey the angle.} Bg5 {so let us go, so we can exchange rooks, at least.} 30. Qe2 Rc1+ 31. Rxc1 Qxc1+ {so it is} 32. Kh2 Qc7+ 33. Kg1 Kf8 {and now, the endgame.} 34. Be4 Bf4 35. g3 {weakening h3} Bd6 36. h4 a5 {queen side attacks...} 37. Qb5 {some last tries.} b6 38. Qd3 Bd7 39. Qd5 Qc5 40. Qa8+ {a last one. Always some adrenaline comes in me in these case: did i forget something? a stalemate?} Ke7 41. Qa6 Bxg3 {well i can take back my pawn lost anyway} 42. Qe2 Be5 {and you have nothing left... step by step, i just took advantage of my opponent's mistake, except maybe for the first -not-deciding- pawn.}
