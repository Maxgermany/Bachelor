1. e4 {Revenge Mark 4   Another thumping in the first match. Didn't have much hope for this one given the total runaround I'd been given.} b6 2. d4 Bb7 3. Bd3 g6 4. b3 Bg7 5. Be3 c5 6. c3 Nc6 7. d5 Ne5 8. f4 Nxd3+ 9. Qxd3 e6 10. dxe6 fxe6 {I have a very bad tendancy against better players of trying to hedgehog, that is to play defensive. The only snag with that idea is I'm a lousy def player. What small skill I have is being a nasty git.  It usually backfires on me cos my opponent, quite apart from being better, gets much more space to dominate.} 11. Nf3 Nf6 12. e5 Ng4 13. O-O Qc7 14. h3 Nxe5 {That surprised me.} 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 16. fxe5 Qxe5 17. Nd2 Rf8 18. Rxf8+ Kxf8 19. Rf1+ Ke7 20. Re1 a5 {As did that, expected Q-g3 tbh.} 21. Nc4 Qg7 22. Nxb6 {Pawn snaffling again, its such a bad habit of mine.} Rd8 23. Na4 Qe5 24. Bxc5+ {Except sometimes it can work. Especially with an exposed attack.} d6 {And in two moves the game changes from me being scared stiff to whoa I've got him. I'm not sure what he thought there, whether he was protecting the queen by doing that but.....} 25. Rxe5 {And now he is in big trouble and accepts it graciously. Most of my games are long drawn out affairs (unless I make one of my trademark errors), so for a game to turn so suddenly and dramatically earns this one a place in my favourites.}
