1. e4 {I always wonder if there will be a day when I have the courage to play 1.d4.} e6 {French.} 2. d4 {Go for the center whenever possible...} d5 3. Nc3 {Defends and develops at the same time.} Bb4 {Nice pin, trying to win a pawn.} 4. e5 {Closing the position and saving the pawn temporarily.} c5 5. Nf3 h6 {Preventing the knight to go to g5.} 6. Bd2 {Not avoiding an exchange but unpinning the knight on c3.} cxd4 7. Nxd4 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 a6 {Now that the dark-squared bishop is gone for black, it's very important to stop the knight from going to b5 and then a nasty Nd6 .} 9. Bd3 Ne7 {f6 is not available for the black knight, so this would be plan B for developing that knight.} 10. O-O O-O 11. Qg4 {I was not sure about this move. I probably made it as a waiting move.} Nbc6 {Forcing white's knight to make a decision or the e pawn will be gone.} 12. Nxc6 Nxc6 {White has now to anticipate the threat ...d4} 13. f4 {Defends the e pawn and prepares for an eventual opening of the f file.} a5 14. Bd2 {This might look like a mistake from white, but this will turn into a tricky position soon.} Qb6+ {Winning the pawn on b2.} 15. Kh1 Qxb2 16. Rab1 {I'm not sure why I'm giving away those pawns...} Qxa2 17. Rbd1 {The plan here was to move that rook from danger, since I was planning to bring my other rook to f3 and eventually to g3 or h3.} f5 {I wasn't expecting this move (not sure if it's good or bad).} 18. Qh4 {If I go with 18.Qg6, then 18...Ne7 it's annoying and loses a tempo for white.} Nd4 {?? The queen can now be trapped and white can win the exchange, a rook for the black queen!} 19. Rda1 {The black queen will be gone! ...right?} Nf3 {!? Black realizes that his queen is about to be trapped! So black decides that it's better to lose the knight rather than losing the queen.} 20. gxf3 {Not with the rook! As that would lose the exchange with 20...Qxa1 } Qb2 21. Rfg1 {Threatening with 22.Qxh6.} Qd4 {Black totally ignores it.} 22. Qxh6 {Threatening with mate in one.} Rf7 23. Raf1 Kf8 {?? This move sealed black's fate.} 24. Qh8+ Ke7 {There's no other choice. This loses the g pawn for black and keeps the attack for white.} 25. Rxg7 b6 {A futile attempt to bring the other rook to defend with a Bb7.} 26. Rxf7+ {Attack continues mercilessly...} Kxf7 27. Qf6+ Ke8 28. Bb5+ Bd7 29. Qxe6+ {Exploiting every weakness to finish the job.} Kf8 30. Bxd7 {This will be the only non-check move from white. Black's fate is still imminent.} Qc4 31. Qf6+ {Mate in 3... I mean... mate in 2 and a half... } Kg8 32. Rg1+ Kh7 33. Bxf5# {So may options to checkmate: 33.Qg7#, 33.Qh4#... This was a nice game, which secured me at least a fourth place on this mini-tourney.}
