1. d4 Nf6 2. h3 e6 {I played this out of my schemes. } 3. Nd2 {Well, white makes me think. } c5 {Let's go with the classical...} 4. dxc5 {Normally, white doesn't take. } Bxc5 {Developed and confortable. } 5. e3 O-O {Just to wait for white to show its cards. } 6. Ngf3 Nc6 7. a3 {White is playing passively. } a5 {I tempt him to Bb5, considering Qb6, but the b5 weakness will be a spine in my stomach for the rest of the game. } 8. Be2 {White goes on quietely. } b6 {? I forgotten about g5's weakness, and planned to start to pressure on white's kingside with the two bishops. } 9. O-O Bb7 10. c3 {Now, Nb3 shouldn't worry me. By delaying d5, I hope to take advantage of the open diagonals. } Qc7 11. Nb3 {At last. } Bd6 {It seems a good set for an attack, isn't it?} 12. Qc2 Ne5 {This seemed so natural I overlooked that after...} 13. Nfd4 {... the b5 square was reacheable by the WN. } Be4 {This seems good, too...} 14. Qd2 Nc4 {...and this, if it induces white to exchange BxN, provides my queen with a good square to escape and stops Nb5. } 15. Qd1 {...but white doesn't fall for it, and prefer to squeeze... but he is very solid, and Ng5 is still threatened. } Bh2+ {Very doubious, but...} 16. Kh1 {...g3 cannot be played. White can go f3, Bb7, but then my bishop would have had squares to go. But now I didn't know just what to do!} Qe5 {?? This was a bad blunder. I just tried to make my queen more active with Qg5, but it was not a solid plan. } 17. Bxc4 d5 {?? Allowing Nc6, if not now, in a near future. But what else? Qg5 is useless against f3.} 18. Be2 {I just lost a piece for nothing. } Qb8 {Weird, but how to save the dsb otherwise?} 19. Nf3 Bc7 {The more I keep my pieces, the more chances I have. } 20. Nbd4 {Now Nc6 and Nb5 loom over me. } h5 {Last desperate attempt to provoke white and open the h column for a rook, if ever one can get to h8. } 21. Nd2 {White threats an exchange I can't lose tempo to avoid. After Bg6, I have no plan. } g5 {Giving my king a semi-safe square to go, and inviting white to...} 22. Bxh5 {Yes, thank you. Now, I will play the same as you did. I won't exchange, no way, but...} Kg7 {Now, if f3, Bd3 or Bg6 just stop my attack, but white went into...} 23. Bf3 {Just a tempo more for me. } Rh8 {Hurry, hurry, white has Nc6...} 24. Bxe4 dxe4 {Very important. If Nxe4, NxN, dxN, Qg4 returns the attack to white!} 25. Nc6 {Here it comes. It's now or never!} Rxh3+ {A surprising non-inmediate sacrifice. If gxh3, Qh8, Kg2, g5, Rh1, Qh4, with a hard to stop attack with Rg8 and Kf8 to come.} 26. Kg1 {?? A losing blunder, for a hard-to-get-in mating combination. This time, passive defence doesn't help. } Rh1+ 27. Kxh1 Qh8+ 28. Kg1 Qh2# {A nice ride for a squeezed queen. }
