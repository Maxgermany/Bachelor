1. d4 {I started a thematic tournament with the Nimzo-Indian defense in order to learn this opening better. It's a good way to explore an opening and to see if a particular opening works for you. You get to play quite a few games with that opening from both the White and Black sides, picking up practice with the common middlegame positions in that opening.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qc2 {I have always preferred the classical variation of the Nimzo-Indian defense. White develops the queen prematurely, but there are two main reasons behind this early queen development:  1. If Black plays Bxc3 , white can recapture with the queen, avoiding doubled pawns on the c-file. 2. The queen on c2 supports the pawn thrust e4.  In this game, I allowed the dpubled pawns anyway, and used the c2-queen to help the e-pawn move to e4 in one go.} Nc6 {4...0-0 seems to be more common.} 5. Nf3 d6 {4...d5 is better - this move wastes a tempo, since Black will want to play ...d5 at some point anyway.} 6. a3 {Forcing Black to give up the Bishop pair. } Bxc3+ 7. bxc3 {Admittedly, the purpose of playing Qc2 was to recapture with the queen, but I decided to keep the queen on c2 to facilitate e4.} h6 8. e4 {White has an imposing center - Black will need to challenge it soon. The most frequent central pawn breaks in the Nimzo for Black are ...c5 and ...d5. In this case, however, the c6-Knight prevents ...c5 and the previous pawn move to d6 means that ...d5 does not come with tempo.} d5 9. cxd5 {Getting rid of the doubled pawn.} Ne7 {? Why not simply recapture?} 10. dxe6 Bxe6 {Black has better development for the pawn, but his pieces are not particularly active.} 11. Bd3 c6 12. O-O {White has caught up in development, and with the extra pawn, has the advantage.} Ng6 {? A bad mistake, as becomes obvious after the next move.} 13. e5 {! Both the Nf6 and the Ng6 are attacked - Black cannot defend against both threats.} Nd5 14. Bxg6 fxg6 15. Qxg6+ {White has won another pawn.} Kd7 {15...Bf7 is no better is worse, because of 16. Qxg7 Rg8 (or Rf8) 17. Qxh6, dropping two more pawns.} 16. Qxg7+ Qe7 17. Qxe7+ Nxe7 {Black is now down three pawns without any compensation.} 18. a4 {Preventing queenside expansion by ...b5.} Bg4 19. Nd2 {Avoiding doubled f-pawns.} Raf8 20. Ba3 {White simply wants to trade pieces and convert his three-pawn advantage into a win. } Rfe8 21. Bxe7 Rxe7 22. Ne4 {Heading towards the protected outpost on d6. Also threatens Nf6 , forking King and Bishop.} Kc7 {Avoids the knight fork on f6, which would drop the g4-Bishop.} 23. Nd6 Rg8 24. Rfb1 {Threatening Rxb7  Kd8 (forced) Rb8  winning the g8-Rook.} b6 25. a5 {Same threat if Black takes on a6.} b5 26. c4 {Same threat again if Black takes on c4.} a6 27. cxb5 cxb5 28. f4 {Now shifting the action to the King-side, the f-pawn is a passed pawn, so it makes sense to advance it down the board.} Bf3 29. g3 h5 30. Rbf1 {Rooks go behind passed pawns.} Bg4 31. Rac1+ Kd7 32. f5 Be2 33. f6 {33...Bxf1 34. fxd7 is good for White.  33...Re6 34. f7 Rf8 35. Rc8! is also good for White.} Bxf1 34. fxe7 Kxe7 35. Rxf1 Ke6 36. Nxb5 {This was probably unnecessary, but I just wanted to prevent any counterplay by Black. Except for the passed b-pawn, Black did not have any threats.} axb5 37. Rb1 h4 38. Kg2 {The main alternative was 38. Rxb5 hxg3 39. hxg3 Rxg3 , with a similar material position.} Kd5 39. Rxb5+ Kxd4 40. e6 {Black will not be able to stop both pawns.} hxg3 41. hxg3 Re8 42. Rb6 Kc5 43. Kf3 Ra8 44. e7 {If 44...Rxa5, White wins easily: 45. e8=Q Kxb6 } Re8 45. Rb7 Kc6 46. a6 Ra8 47. Kf4 {Again threatening e8=Q if Black takes on a6.} Kd6 48. a7 Ke6 49. Rb8 {At least one pawn will queen now, so Black resigned.  }
