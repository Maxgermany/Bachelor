[Opening "Benoni defence (A61)"]

1. d4 {This is my preferred opening move.} Nf6 2. c4 c5 {Benoni defense.} 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. Nf3 g6 7. Bf4 {This is the first move that is out of opening book.  Three systems stem from here.  g3 fianchetto variation, Nd2 Nimzovich (Knight's tour) variation, and Bg5 Uhlmann variation.  Bf4 scores well in the world db and is played later most of the time with Bg5.} a6 8. e4 {increasing defense of d5, black will be kicking the c3 knight from the square soon.} b5 9. Bd3 {plan is to play Bc2 if c4 and Ne2 if b4.} Bg7 {Black lines his bishop up on the great diagonal.} 10. O-O O-O 11. h3 {Prevents the troublesome Bg4.} Re8 12. Re1 Bb7 13. Qd2 Qb6 {Here we reach a climax in development.  I make a move which I had mixed feeling about, seen next move.  Whites main ace in the whole is his center but black will have great chances with a queen side attack.  Notice that the move called for in the position e5 loses the d5 pawn.  Best would probably be Rd1 or Bc2.} 14. Bxd6 {Bxd6?! I could help but make this move my gut was telling me to make this move.  Black wins both db games form this position.  The big thing is blacks dsb is going to be a big problem.} Qxd6 15. e5 {Regaining the piece.} Rxe5 {Rxe5! I'll give this an exclamation point, may be a blunder but black will be able to keep white in a funky position.} 16. Nxe5 b4 {riding the only defender of d5.} 17. Nd1 {The only decent square for the knight.} Qxd5 18. Nf3 {This defends mate on g2 and allows the knight(d1) and bishop to move.} Qd7 19. Qe2 {defending my king side pawn structure.} Nc6 {Stops whites Qe7} 20. Ne3 {Blocks the threat of Re8.} Nd4 {Nd4! Black builds up overwhelming pressure.} 21. Nxd4 cxd4 {Black has great compensation.  Nc2 gains nothing after a5 things are iffy at best.} 22. Ng4 {Trying desperately to trade down. } Nd5 {Black has a spacial squeeze and plays the correct move stopping all trades.} 23. Bc4 {Trying to undermine blacks center knight.} h5 24. Ne5 Qe6 {Black has gain great position.} 25. Nf3 Qxe2 26. Rxe2 {Black trades queens.  White pieces are disorganized at best.} Nf4 {Nf4! black gains pawn structure (which is the point of the two bishops) after Bxf3 next move.} 27. Re7 Bxf3 {Rxf7 Bd5 black gains the advantage.} 28. gxf3 Rc8 {Up till this point I've played a fairly solid game.  This next move however is slightly ruinous.} 29. Bxa6 {Bxa6?! better was 29. Bxf7+ Kf8 30. Rd7 Rc2.} Rc2 {Rd1 or Rd7 are best but b3 seemed logical placing the lsb on c4 next move.  however black has a very strong continuation.} 30. b3 d3 {This pawn will be impossible to stop.} 31. Bxd3 {forced (just about)} Nxd3 32. Rd1 {planed after Bxd3.} Nxf2 33. Rdd7 Nxh3+ 34. Kf1 Bc3 {Bc3 and the game is all over Rf2# is threatened.} 35. Re2 {After making this move I knew it was over Rc1+ Kg2 Nf4+ wins the rook for a knight.}
