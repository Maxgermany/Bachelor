1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e3 h6 5. Nbd2 a6 6. c3 Bd7 7. Ne5 {First aggressive move. If f6, Qh5+. } b5 8. a3 {Normal. Black can cause problems on the Qside. } Nf6 9. g4 {Attacking asap. } Bd6 10. h4 {I don't fear the exchange. } Ne4 11. Ndf3 {This supports the center after f6, Nd3. } Bxe5 12. dxe5 {This cramps both of us, but I think it is better that a lot of exchanges and loss of tension. } f5 {Interesting and dangerous. } 13. gxf5 {Better than exf6 ep. ? I'm not sure. My plan was to make a hole in d6 for my pawn. } exf5 14. Nd4 {He can exchange my N, and my e6 plan will be delayed. But I'll have a wonderful pawn chain, so I won't complain. } O-O {? Very bad, just in front of the open column. } 15. e6 {...and overlooking this move. } Nxd4 {You see, the idea is that if I take the N with the Q, Bxe6 and d5 is defended. BUT...} 16. exd7 {Black has to retire the N, and now d5 IS not defended, and my Q will take it with check! Any other move loses a piece.  } Qxd7 {? Black preferred to lose the N. If Ne6, Qxd5. Qe7 and it seems holdable. } 17. Qxd4 Nf6 18. O-O-O {Pressuring d5. } Rac8 19. Bg2 {Threatening d5.} c5 {Too late, since I take with check. c6 would have been wiser. Qb6, though...} 20. Bxd5+ Nxd5 21. Qxd5+ Qxd5 22. Rxd5 c4 23. Rd6 {If Rd7, Rf7 and nothing special happens. } Rca8 24. Rhd1 Kh7 {Not worse than anything else. } 25. h5 {Blocking g7 where it is. } a5 {? Ra7 was almost forced. } 26. Rd6d7 {Winning, but how, exactly? I've seen the mate position here. } a4 27. Be5 {Pressuring g7, as obvious. } Rfg8 28. Rg1 {More pressure. } Rae8 {Simply Bxg7 wins, but I wanted a mate. } 29. Bf4 Ref8 {Black can do nothing but wait. } 30. Rg6 {Do you see it now? :-)} Rfd8 31. Rxh6# {I'm sure she was shoked. It happens sometimes. }
