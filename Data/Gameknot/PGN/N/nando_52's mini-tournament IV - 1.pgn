1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. c4 {The Maroczy Bind – not the automatic win it was once thought to be, but a very tough formation to meet nonetheless.} Nf6 6. Nc3 g6 7. Be2 Bg7 8. Be3 Nd7 {Castling would make more sense here.} 9. O-O a6 {And now Black really needs to be castling, not fooling around with Queenside pawns.} 10. Qd2 Nde5 {This is too provocative for the Black position to bear.} 11. f4 {! The start of a plan to trap the light-squared Bishop.} Ng4 {…Nd7 was relatively best, though 12. f5 is not pleasant for Black.} 12. Bxg4 Bxg4 13. f5 {! The Bishop is short of squares.} Ne5 14. b3 {Necessary, as 14. h3 Nxc4 15. Qf2 Nxe3 16. Qxe3 Qb6 wins for Black.} O-O {!? …gxf5 also deserved consideration, planning to keep the King in the center and get compensation for the piece by attacking down the g-file.} 15. h3 Bh5 16. g4 Bxg4 17. hxg4 Nxg4 {White has an extra piece but the weak dark squares, White's exposed King, and Black's Kingside pawn mass are causes for concern.} 18. Rad1 {! Others invite more trouble: 18. Rac1 Nxe3 19. Qxe3 Qb6 20. Rfd1 e6!; 18. Rf4? Nxd3 19. Qd3 Bh6; 18. Nd5 e6!; etc.} Qb6 {?? Black must take the Bishop in order to exploit the dark squares with this move. This move order allows White to hang onto the Bishop for 6 crucial extra moves.} 19. Nd5 {! The start of a decisive combination.} Qa7 {? Stubbornly hanging onto the a7-g1 diagonal. Cowering with …Qd8 was better, after which Bg5 saves the Bishop.} 20. Nxe7+ Kh8 21. f6 {! A sacrifice that threatens to trap Black's Queen.} Nxf6 {? 21. …Bxf6 22. Rxf6 Nxf6 23. Nc6! leads to the same, but with an extra exchange for Black. White is firmly on top either way.} 22. Ndc6 {!} Nxe4 {? Losing another piece.} 23. Qe1 {! After this calm sidestep, Black has nothing.} bxc6 24. Bxa7 Rxa7 25. Nxc6 Rc7 26. Qxe4 {Black should really resign here, but plays on until just before mate. Note to readers: Please do not do this. Resigning a hopeless game is a simple matter of etiquette; some of us without premium memberships would like to play someone else and don't want to wait for two weeks.} Rfc8 27. Nb4 a5 28. Nd5 Rc7c5 29. Rxf7 Be5 30. Nf6 Bxf6 31. Rxf6 Re5 32. Qb7 Rce8 33. Rf7 Rh5 34. Qd7 Rg8 35. Qxd6 Rg5+ 36. Kf2 Re8 37. Qf6+ {}
