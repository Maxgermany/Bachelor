1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 { More common is 3.d4 or the Nimzovich Rossolimo attack which is 3. Bb5.} g6 { } 4. d4 cxd4 { A forced capture.} 5. Nxd4 Bg7 { Threatning 6. Nxd4} 6. Be3 { Developing a piece and supporting the d4 knight.} Nf6 { Attacking the e4 pawn} 7. Bd3 { Supporting the e4 pawn} O-O { To bring the King to safety and to allow the Rook to do some work.} 8. Qd2 { Preparing 0-0-0 and giving White the chance to attack the Black Kingside  with 9.Bh6} a6 { I really should have played 8.Re8 so If White where to do 9. Bh6 I could   keep my strong Bishop with 9.Bh8.} 9. Nxc6 bxc6 { To recapture.....} 10. Bh6 { I thought that he would play that} d6 { To stop a pawn advance and to allow the bishop to d7 or e6} 11. Bg5 { White should have done 0-0.} c5 { He allowed me the chance to play 11. h5 but I missed my chance. } 12. Nd5 { ?  I found a way to win a pawn by...} Nxd5 {  This!} 13. exd5 {  White recaptured} Bxb2 14. Rb1 Bg7 { Retreating....} 15. O-O { White brings his King to safety.} f5 { ?  Looks sharp at a first glance but it is a bad move because  it makes the     e7 pawn backward and e6 square is also weak.} 16. Rfe1 { Exploiting the weakness} Bf6 { to offer a trade and to support the e7 pawn} 17. Bh6 { White is correct not to swap off} Rf7 18. c4 Bd7 { To finally develop the Bishop} 19. g3 { To support the h4 square for the pawn} Rb8 { I wanted to exchange Rooks} 20. h4 { He should have played Rbc1 to avoid the exchange.} Rxb1 21. Rxb1 Bg7 22. Bg5 { White is right not to exchance this time.} Qf8 { I wanted to support an h6 push but by doing this I allowed his Rook to do   some very good work. And the h6 push would have been not very good  anyway.} 23. Rb6 { White is now attacking the a6 pawn} Qc8 { To support the a6 pawn.} 24. Qa5 { Putting more pressure on the pawn} Qf8 { Whatever I do I could not save the pawn so I let him have it} 25. Rxa6 { White has now won back his pawn plus his position is better, White has  a passed pawn ( on a2).} Bf6 { I needed to  get some more space and allow my King to g7 to help avoid   a future pin on the 8th rank by the Rook.} 26. Ra8 Be8 { I have no other choice.} 27. Bc2 { !  A good move which is threatning 28. Ba4 which will cost me some     material.} Bxg5 28. hxg5 e5 { I would say that that was forced because otherwise I would lose the   Bishop after 29. Ba4} 29. dxe6 e.p. Re7 {  The Rook threatens to get the pawn back but more importantly supports   the Bishop.} 30. Qd2 Rxe6 31. Qd5 { Creating a second pin but this time on the diagonal.} Qe7 { ?  I had to waste my next move cause I didn't play Qf7 on this move} 32. Ba4 { To add pressure to the Bishop now.} Qf7 {  To allow the Rook to cover the Bishop and to break off the pin on the    diagonal. But unfortantly it did not quite work because of....  } 33. Bxe8 { The fact that I would lose my Rook by doing 33. Rxe8  34. Rxe8  and I  can't do Qxe8 because the Black Queen is pinned to the Black King by the  White Queen.} Re1+ 34. Kg2 Qxd5+ { I have no other choices.} 35. cxd5 { recapturing...} Re5 { To threaten to take the d pawn and gain a very important passed pawn.} 36. Bc6+ { White supports the pawn and at the same time it is check by the White  Rook.} Kf7 { I was thinking that I was going to lose the game around this point   because I was a whole bishop down. But I decided to play on and hope   for the best ( which is exacly what happened!!)} 37. f4 { Attacking my Rook} Re2+ {  It is check} 38. Kf3 { Attacking my Rook again} Rd2 39. a4 { He started to run his passed pawn and around this point I feared that not  much can be done to stop it so I.....} c4 { Advanced my passed pawn as well} 40. Rb8 { To allow the Rook to get to b1 to attempt to stop the passer and to allow   the a8 destination square avalible for the white pawn.} c3 { Running the passed pawn} 41. Rb4 { White should have played 41. Rb1 which is more defensive.} Rd3+ { I wanted to get his King to the 2nd rank so I would gain check at the same  time. But I was not expecting White to drop a pawn by his next move.} 42. Ke2 Rxg3 43. a5 Rg2+ { I played this so I could have a possibility to advance the c-pawn or to threaten to exchange the very critical rook with Rb2 which is what I played  in the game.} 44. Kf1 { Attacking my Rook} Rb2 { Threatning the exchange of Rooks.} 45. Rc4 { To attack the c-pawn } c2 { So I advance it.} 46. Ba4 { White is now threatning the fairly obvious Rxc2 or Bxc2 which will give him  a won game. But I promoted the pawn by} Rb1+ {  THIS!!!} 47. Ke2 c1=Q { Now I have managed to promote so.....} 48. Rxc1 { White swaps} Rxc1 { and now I am the exchange up!} 49. a6 { Running his passer but it is too late he should have done it earlier, much earlier.} Ra1 { } 50. Bb5 { Supporting the passer} Ra5 { Attacking the Bishop} 51. Bd3 Ke7 { If 51. Rxd5?? Then 52. Bc4! pins the Rook to the King and White will then   win after all.} 52. Kd2 Rxd5 { Now it is safe to munch the pawn!} 53. Kc3 Ra5 { To stop the pawn moving any further.} 54. Kb4 Ra1 55. Kb5 Ke6 { To get the King on a walk to wipe out the f4 and g5 pawn.} 56. Kc6 { To stop my King from going to d5.} Ra4 { So I attacked the f4 pawn with my Rook instead.} 57. Kb7 Kd5 { I may as well let my King do some work} 58. Kc7 Kd4 { Attacking the Bishop} 59. Bf1 Ke3 {Now attacking the pawn} 60. Kxd6 Kxf4 61. Kc7 { } Kxg5 { Now I have 3 passed pawns as well!} 62. Kb8 f4 { Run my pawn} 63. a7 { } Kg4 64. a8=Q Rxa8+ 65. Kxa8 { I now have a clearly won game!} Kf3 { } 66. Kb7 g5 67. Kc6 g4 { Running my pawns!} 68. Kd5 h5 69. Ke5 h4 70. Kf5 h3 71. Kg5 h2 { White resigned at this point nothing can be done to stop the h- pawn from  promoting. I would like to thank Japanesebeef1 for this very good game  that we played! }
