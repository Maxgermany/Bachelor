1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nbd7 4. Nbd2 e6 5. e3 c6 {Black is creating a solid scheme I use to play with white pieces... but with the bishop closed in c8, it is just too passive. } 6. Bd3 {Since he has no intention to play c5, I can play this b on his optimal square for attack. } Be7 7. Ne5 O-O 8. g4 {Here we go. } Nxe5 9. dxe5 Nd7 {Nf3 is ok, but I am looking for blood. } 10. g5 {...my blood? You'll see...} Bxg5 11. Qh5 {With a mate threat. Only move...} h6 12. Rg1 {Maybe Nf3 was more accurate. } Bxf4 13. exf4 Kh8 14. Nf3 {Threatening Ng5 and Nxf7 for the least. } Nc5 15. O-O-O Nxd3+ 16. Rxd3 {My good b is gone, but now I can bring my other R to h3 or g3.} Bd7 17. Ng5 {Maybe Nh4, with a sight on Ng6+ was good, too, or even better. } Be8 18. Rh3 {Tactic, tactic...} f6 19. Nf7+ {...the only move for black is RxN, after which I'll play Qg6, with the terrible threat Rxh6+ and mate on the next. If he plays...} Bxf7 {...this is mate in two.} 20. Qxh6+ {Et voil√°. It won't be so easy in the future... but a nice goodby before sleeping. Thanks for watching. }
