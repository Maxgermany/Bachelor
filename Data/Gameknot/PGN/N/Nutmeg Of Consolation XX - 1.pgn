[Opening "Four knights (C47), Scotch, 4...exd4"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {The Four Knights Game, taking literally "move knights before bishops."} 4. d4 {The Scotch Four Knights Game, can be reached from the Scotch Game.} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bb4 6. Nxc6 {Opening the way for his queen?  Disrupting my pawns?} bxc6 7. f3 {That pawn didn't need weakening, note the threat of Qh4} O-O {The e file is a good place to attack.} 8. Bd2 Re8 9. h3 {Doesn't really accomplish anything.} d5 {Hoping for pressure on d2.} 10. Be2 dxe4 11. O-O exf3 {I'll take a free pawn.} 12. Bxf3 Bb7 {Defending c6, but my bishop is cramped.} 13. a3 {Doesn't gain anything, since I regain the tempo by checking.} Bc5+ 14. Kh1 Qd6 {I have many attacking possibilities.  My knight could move in as the queen and bishop control the king's flight squares.  My rook could go to the d file to threaten the Bd2.} 15. Bg5 Rad8 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. Ne4 Qe5 {Better would be 17...Rxe4 18. Bxe4 Rxd1 19.Raxd1, winning a knight and queen for two rooks.} 18. Qe2 Bd4 {Attacking b2.} 19. c3 {But it really just lost me a tempo.} Bb6 {At least the bishop isn't under attack.} 20. Qc4 c5 {Opening up one bishop and closing off another.  The dark bishop doesn't do much the rest of the game.} 21. Rfe1 Bxe4 {I wasn't sure what to do, so I just exchanged pieces.} 22. Bxe4 Qe6 {The losing move.  I was hoping to trade queens or at least annoy his, allowing to free my bishop with c4.} 23. Bxh7+ {Watch when there's the possibility of a discovered attack with check.} Kxh7 24. Rxe6 {I could be down a queen and pawn for a bishop and rook, with a chance of recovering, but I made another mistake.} Rxe6 {fxe6 would be better.} 25. Qh4+ {I don't stand a chance with a bishop and rook against a queen and rook, so I resigned.}
