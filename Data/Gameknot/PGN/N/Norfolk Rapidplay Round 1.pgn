1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 {My preffered line of the scandinavian} c6 4. dxc6 Nxc6 5. d3 {safest move in this line IMO} Bf5 {Better than the usual Bg4, Nd4 IMO, causes white real problems.} 6. Nf3 e5 7. Nc3 Bc5 {Black is shaping up nicely} 8. Be2 Qd7 {Preparing Rd8} 9. Nh4 {Rather than the usual 0-0, Rd8, Ne1.  Not sure if it's sound or not. But thought it would buy me some time anyway} Bxf2+ {So much for buying me time! } 10. Kxf2 Qd4+ 11. Kg3 {Alternative was Be3, Qxh4 , g3, Qh3. But thought I could hold the knight} g6 {Good move. Can't take the bishop.} 12. h3 {Creating an escape square for  the king, although I'm sure there's a better line here this is a simple line and  I was running low on time  White - 18 minutes Black  - 20 minutes} O-O-O {The right move.} 13. Nf3 {Maybe there is a better move but nothing wrong with this} Qd6 14. Bg5 {A bad move, e4  and white is pegged back considerabely.} Nh5+ {the best move considering he missed e4 } 15. Kf2 {Can't play the planned Kh2 as e4  is then still playable} Rd7 {Think this is a bit slow. e4 is still strong IMO} 16. Nd5 {Blocking the siege on d3.} Re8 17. Be3 {didn't like possibilies of Qg3  later on picking up the bishop} e4 {Should've been played earlier but still the right move IMO} 18. dxe4 {Best response.} Qg3+ {A clever line and the best for black } 19. Kg1 Bxe4 20. Qe1 {Have to do something about this kingside rampage  White - 9 minutes Black  - 11 minutes} Bxd5 21. Bf2 {Intending to kick the queen away then take on d5. Alternative is cxd5, Rxe3, dxc6 which in hindsight is fine. I think Bxf3 is strong here for black. Picking up a hell of alot of material for the queen.} Qf4 { But not spotted in the time rush.} 22. cxd5 Rxd5 23. Rd1 {Planning to swap off into a winning endgame  White - 5 minutes Black - 2 minutes} Ra5 {weak move in the time rush.} 24. Qd2 {Persisting about the swap-off.} Rxa2 {Missing white's next move due to complete lack of thinking time!} 25. Qd7+ {Kb8, Qxe8 , Kc7, Rd7#}
