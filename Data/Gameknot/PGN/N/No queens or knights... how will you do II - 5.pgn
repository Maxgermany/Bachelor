1. Nc3 Nc6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Ne5 Ne4 4. Nxc6 Nxc3 5. Nxd8 Nxd1 6. Kxd1 Kxd8 7. e4 e5 8. Bc4 {I attack the f-pawn...} Bc5 {...and my opponent does the same to mine...} 9. Bxf7 Bxf2 {...which we exchange.} 10. Rf1 {I repel the bishop here...} Bc5 11. Bc4 d6 12. Rf7 {...and put the rook on the attack.} Bg4+ 13. Be2 {I go for the blocking move...} Bxe2+ 14. Kxe2 {...and we exchange} g5 15. d3 {This opens up the remaining bishop...} g4 16. Bg5+ {...which I unleash.} Kc8 17. Raf1 b6 18. Rf7f8+ {I attack the king...} Kb7 19. Rxh8 {...and steal a rook...} Rxh8 {...in exchange for one of mine.} 20. Bh6 {This move allows me to launch an assault on the remaining rook...} Kc6 21. Rf8 {...which I attack...} Rxf8 22. Bxf8 {...and get another exchange, with the bishop deep in enemy territory.} h5 23. Be7 d5 24. Bxc5 Kxc5 {I deemed it worth swapping bishops...} 25. exd5 Kxd5 {...and pawns, creating more space. Who would crack?} 26. Ke3 c5 27. c4+ {This drove the king back} Ke6 28. Ke4 a6 29. g3 {Now the king cannot penetrate...} Kf6 30. Kd5 {...but mine can now.} Kf5 31. Kc6 e4 32. dxe4+ Kxe4 33. Kxb6 Kd4 34. a3 {I decide to give my far left-hand pawn a start...} Kxc4 35. Kxa6 {...and give it some space.} Kb3 36. Kb5 c4 37. a4 {I think my opponent resigned here because the response to Kxb2 would be Kxc4, and my a-pawn would have a clear run, whilst the response to c3 would be bxc3, and again my a-pawn can't be caught.}
