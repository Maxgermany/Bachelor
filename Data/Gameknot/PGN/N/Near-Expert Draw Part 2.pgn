1. e4 {Hi everyone, now get set for Part 2 cos here it comes!} c5 2. c3 {2. c3 - I played the main Nf3 line against the same opponent and lost so I decided to try a c3 Sicilian.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. d4 cxd4 6. cxd4 d6 7. Bc4 {7. Bc4 - the last few moves have been a combo of development and establishing a pawn centre.  There will now follow a plethora of exchanges.} Nb6 8. Bb5 dxe5 9. Nxe5 Bd7 10. Nxd7 Qxd7 11. Nc3 {11. Nc3 - develops a piece and supports my bishop on b5.} e6 12. O-O Be7 13. Qg4 {13. Qg4 - this is the main line suggested in the World DB here.  I really do need Glenda to take a more active role in the middlegame, I decide to take the plunge but what will this achieve here?} O-O 14. Bxc6 Qxc6 15. Bh6 {15. Bh6 - suddenly Michael finds himself in Old Matey's shadow.  Mate on g7 is threatened.} Bf6 16. Rfd1 Kh8 17. Ne4 {17. Ne4 - threatens Nxf6.} Rfg8 18. Bg5 Bd8 19. Bxd8 Rgxd8 20. Ng5 {20. Ng5 - threatening Nf7 check winning exchange.} Rdf8 21. Qh5 {21. Qh5 - Old Matey looms up again, this time Glenda is threatening to strike on h7.} Qc2 22. Rac1 {22. Rac1 - note the b2 pawn is really toxic here.  If the Wicked Witch takes it she can say bye bye to her other half!} Qg6 23. Qxg6 hxg6 {23. .......... hxg6 - this queen trade disrupts black's kingside pawns.} 24. Rd2 {24. Rd2 - I prepare to double rooks on the c file.  Michael moves his knight to d5 next move to prevent one of my rooks entrenching themselves on c7.} Nd5 25. a3 Kg8 {25. ......... Kg8 - backs up f7 pawn.} 26. g3 Rfc8 27. Rdc2 Rxc2 28. Rxc2 Rd8 29. Nf3 {29. Nf3 - after taking control of the c file, manoeuvering my pawns to prevent a knight incursion and backing up my isolated d pawn I decided to offer my opponent a draw.  If I got a refusal I would have centralised Henry but he accepted.  So I achieve another high draw - this time I failed by just 3 rating points to net my first ever rated Expert Draw.  Hope you have had a good read.  Cheers and bye for now.  Joanne}
