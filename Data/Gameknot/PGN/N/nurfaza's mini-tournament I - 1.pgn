1. c4 {I'll try the Reti Opening} Nf6 {he's not committing..} 2. Nf3 {maybe d4 would have been better...} g6 {he's going to put his bishop on g7 and castle} 3. g3 {I'll match that on the other diagonal} Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O {just as I thought} 5. d4 {If he doesn't want the center, I'll take it!} c6 {I wish I knew how to play better against weak opening moves} 6. Bg2 d5 {now he challenges for the center} 7. cxd5 {I decide to swap the pawns} Nxd5 {I'm not interested in trading the knights... it's time to castle} 8. O-O Nd7 {I guess he doesn't want my knight either} 9. Bg5 {it just seemed like the thing to do} Nxc3 {now he wants to trade knights... } 10. bxc3 {I'm ok with it, it strengthens my d4 pawn} h6 {he drives away my bishop} 11. Bf4 {I only back up 1 square, hoping to lure his pawns further out} g5 {it works!} 12. Be5 {now I want to get his dark-squared bishop} Nxe5 {he must want to keep it...} 13. Nxe5 {so I trade bishop for knight} Bxe5 {oh, there's my bishop!} 14. dxe5 {got it!} Qxd1 {I guess he doesn't like queens} 15. Rfxd1 {I'll trade them if forced} Bg4 {putting pressure on a pawn?} 16. f3 {I run the "girly-man" off} Bh5 17. Rd7 {I've always heard that a rook on the 7th rank is cause for great distress, so I go there} b5 {one pawn escapes...} 18. Rxe7 {one does not} Rfd8 {oops! pawn snatching cost me the open file (should have doubled the rooks first)} 19. e3 {I'm hoping to undouble my e-file pawns by trading pawns} Rd3 {he thwarts my plans} 20. a4 {I try to eliminate the pawn imbalance on the Queen-side} Rxe3 {he takes a duck} 21. g4 {a diversion} Bg6 22. axb5 {we trade pawns} cxb5 23. Raxa7 {and now I double rooks on the 7th rank} Rxa7 {well, ok, it was temporary} 24. Rxa7 {I'm feeling good about my position} Rxe5 {well, back to even} 25. Rb7 {I thimk this pawn is mine...} Bd3 26. Rd7 Bc4 27. Rd4 Re1+ 28. Kf2 {he's just out-playing me now... I need to work on my endgame} Rc1 29. f4 Rxc3 30. fxg5 hxg5 31. Rd8+ Kg7 32. Rb8 Rc2+ 33. Kg3 Rb2 34. Bc6 b4 35. Bb5 Be6 36.
