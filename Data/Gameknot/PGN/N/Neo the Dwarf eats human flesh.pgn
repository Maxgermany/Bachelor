1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nf3 {The standard Indian Defence. My opponent could have played e3 or Nd2 at this point to continue the lines.} c5 4. e3 a6 5. c4 Nc6 6. Nc3 Bg4 {At this point, most pieces are developed, but none are captured. I still intended to play 7. ... e6, but instead my opponent captured d5 and all hell broke loose.} 7. cxd5 Nxd5 8. Bg3 cxd4 {I see the opportunity to take out my opponent's central pawns here. I suspect that my opponent will either capture my knight on d5 or recapture on d4. If my opponent had moved Ne4 I could have continued capturing e3, and down would go his pawn structure.} 9. exd4 Bxf3 {I sieze the opportunity with this move to either mess up my opponent's pawn structure with gxf3 or win the pawn on d4 after the queen recaptures. (I hadn't thought of my doubly-attacked knight on d5 when I played this game. Oh well...)} 10. gxf3 {The less expected option. Note that my opponent still has that bishop on g3.} e6 11. Bg2 Qb6 {As development continues, I plan an attack to win some pawns, either on b2 or d4. There are a lot of ways my opponent can defend from here.} 12. O-O Qxb2 13. Nxd5 exd5 {As I recapture, the e column opens up, my lonely king at the end. A second way for my opponent to get at me. I had not realized the danger I was in when I was playing this game; I was too focused on winning those queen-side pawns.} 14. Rb1 Qxd4 15. Qb3 b5 {In order to prevent a mounting attack on my b pawn, I sacrifice the protection of my knight. A third line of sight opens up for my opponent: the c column. Together with his h2-b8 diagonal and the e file, there is bound to be some chaos on my side of the board.} 16. Rbd1 Qc4 {I may have lost the pawn on d5, but my opponent wanted to keep his queen, which was probably the better option on his part.} 17. Qb2 f6 {Now I see the attack on my g7 pawn. After delivering Rfe1+, my bishop will have to come out or else be trapped inside when I move my knight. I figured that this would be the best defense.} 18. Rdc1 {A skewer with my queen and knight. The only way to stop it is with an attack on the white undefended queen: Qd4 or Qb4.} Qd4 {With the possibility of my opponent retreating his queen to b1, maybe Qb4 would have been better for me. I can't remember why I thought Qd4 was better; probably because it opened up the way for my bishop and protected by vulnerable d5 pawn.} 19. Qc2 Ne7 {It was only now that I realized the perilous situation that I was in. I had no choice but to box my bishop in. Rc8 would only lead to Bh3, a disastrous fourth line of sight for my opponent; There is the threat of a fork on my king and rook if the enemy queen accesses c6; I still have my intention of castling in mind, so I don't move my king. } 20. Rfe1 {A resulting pin from the white f1 rook forces me to relinquish my hopes of castling. I simply can not let c6 go unguarded.} Kf7 21. Bh3 {The fourth and most critical line of attack is set. No matter how I can try to defend myself, I will lose at least a knight or bishop.} g6 {I hope to fianchetto my bishop, or at least provide an escape route for my king after Be6+.} 22. Bd6 Qa7 {According to Chessmaster8000, this was the only mistake I had made thus far. Still, I hardly saw it as a mistake and had thought I had many small errors further back. I eventually moved my queen back to d4 after his c1 rook attacked. I sought to further defend the 7th rank, as well as my rook.} 23. Qb3 Re8 {Further, I defend my knight. I see a possible Bd7 after my queen is threatened by his rook.} 24. Rc7 Qd4 25. Be6+ Kg7 26. Bxd5 {...And there goes my pawn. Maybe I should have moved my queen to the 8th rank, but I feared the white queen getting close to my king and capturing the pawn herself.} Kh6 {I release the pin on my knight. I hope my king is in a better position.} 27. Bxe7 {And finally, as I had predicted, I lose the knight. I could have given up, but I wanted to see which way the game would go, and also see if my opponent could prove himself worthy.} Bg7 {I decide not to recapture--which would be pointless, capitalizing instead on the pin my rook has on the white dark-square bishop, letting my rooks protect eachother, and protecting my own bishop and pawn.} 28. Re4 Qd2 29. Qe3+ {I had moved my queen to d2 with the expectation of giving it greater mobility, however I did not see the forced exchange. Since I am behind in material, it is not in my best interest to trade it off.} Qxe3 30. fxe3 {In addition to forcing an exchange, my opponent gains a better pawn structure, with a new central pawn. These pawns on e3 and f3 become key as the game progresses.} Rec8 {With the trouble of freeing my h1 rook and getting it out in the open, I have nothing better to do but to offer an exchange. It would have been in my opponent's best interest to take it, as you will see what will happen.} 31. Bd6 Rcd8 {Now I have two unprotected bishops lined up, acknowledging my weak g7 bishop. There is bound to be an exchange, but if my opponent wasn't careful he would have lost one bishop. Although he did conduct the exchange without error, his real downfall comes afterward, as you will see.} 32. Rh4+ Kg5 {Forced.} 33. Bg3 {My opponent attempts to lock me in with his rook, pawns, and bishop. Little did he know that he was setting himself up for impending doom.} Rxd5 34. f4+ Kf5 {Forced.} 35. Re7 {Instead of immediately recapturing my bishop, my opponent threatens checkmate with e4. I only have a couple checks on his king before I would be forced to sacrifice my rook. G5 would only lead to 36. e4+, Kg6, and then f5#. I consider resignation in a few moves, but I am curious, just to see if my opponent would make one little mistake...} Rd1+ 36. Kg2 Rd2+ 37. Kh3 {...He did. By instead moving his king to f1, he would have prevented my rook from coming to e2. I would have had to sacrifice it by moving it to d4 instead, but now there is a glimmer of hope for me.} Re2 38. Rxg7 h5 {After the recapture, I see an opportunity to box my opponent's rook in.} 39. Re7 {If my rook strays from the e file, it is certain checkmate for me.} Rc8 {I develop, cautious (and lucky) for not putting my rook on the dark d8 square.} 40. Bf2 {Again, the bishop cannot be captured due to an impending checkmate. My opponent plans to move his king to g3, protecting the bishop and making an escape route for his rook to come to h3. But I see a plan...} g5 {With this threat, the only way that my opponent can save his rook is by either capturing h5 or capturing g5, both of which take away the threat of imminent checkmate, allowing me to take the bishop!} 41. e4+ Kg6 {I do not want to exchange my rook, a key player in my plan.} 42. fxg5 {Now I can win the bishop outright, but there is another alternative: By simply recapturing on g5, I can pretty much guarantee that I will win one of my opponent's rooks. He could play Rh6+, but then I would move my king to f7, forking his two rooks.} fxg5 {And with that, seeing that one of his rooks was doomed, my opponent resigned. I was quite happy with the outcome, though unexpected. I guess it just goes to show never to give up.   Thank You for viewing!
