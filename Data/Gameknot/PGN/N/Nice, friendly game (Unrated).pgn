1. e4 {I started this game because I was bored and wanted to play someone a couple days after joining the "Southern Chess". Why not play a teammate? I looked for someone near my rank, and voila! here we are. I'm actually annotating this on my 22nd move.  Ah, my standard opening.} c5 {I'm seeing this more and more nowadays...} 2. d4 {This is the something Moria Gambit... I have no clue about official names, but I'm told he's to take the pawn... <_<} e6 {Gambit... declined?  FINE! Gambit sucked as an X-men anyway. :P} 3. Ne2 {Might as well...} Nf6 4. f3 Bd6 5. e5 {Drop it like it's hot (hot) drop it like it's hot (hot) And when a b--ch gets an- oh, sorry, I really don't have much to say about this schtuff. I figured a favorable pin was in store since I was feeling a threat in the middle, so i figured that snatching a pawn or knight for a pawn was very good. Especially the bishop, since it wasn't protected.} Nd5 6. exd6 Qa5+ {Harsh, dude, harsh. Moving that queen all up in my turf, denying me that d6 pawn coverage from his buddy back two squares...} 7. c3 c4 8. Bd2 Qb6 9. b3 {And I have to make the nessesary sacrifice...} Qxd6 10. bxc4 {An eye for an eye.} Nf6 11. Nf4 {I forget my original reasoning for this move... I think it was to keep the queen off d5 because of my next move...} e5 {he's probably plotting to force my knight away and get himself a pair of pawns for one of his own. well, either that, or he wants me to blow a move moving my knight back to defend that pesky pawn there on d4} 12. c5 {He can have the Knight. I wants me somma dat!} Qc7 {I honestly considered for a few minutes chasing the queen with my knight.} 13. Nd3 {but, alas, it was not to be!} Nd5 14. g3 {flanchetto prep, dawg.} O-O 15. Bg2 Nc6 {Apparently, he doesn't see me lining up the knight in my sights with my bishop...} 16. f4 f6 {And he gave me a free check, to boot.} 17. Bxd5+ Kh8 {Does anyone else agree that having a king stuck in one square is a bad thing?} 18. fxe5 Re8 {smart move. It locks off my pawn from causing further discord amoungst the Black Forces.} 19. Bf4 {time to pump up the defense. You can do eet, little guy! Scare black into submission!} b6 {now if only he'd move his other knight <3} 20. O-O {to free up the pawn, y'see. I'm not a big fan of castle-ing (I cant spell >.<)} Bb7 {I didn't forsee his next move...} 21. Re1 Nxe5 {giving up his knight for a pot-shot at my bishops and knight... GENIUS! :P} 22. dxe5 {I accept his attack on my bishop humbly. I was out manuvered this day... BUT I SHALL WIN THIS WAR!!} Bxd5 23. exf6 {What happen? Somebody set us up the bomb!} Qd8 24. Ne5 {There's the set-up for Nf7} Qxf6 {I shall avenge you, loyal pawn!!} 25. Qxd5 {!} Rad8 {Pawn fortification...} 26. Nf7+ {All your Base are belong to us! The following is the Checkmating sequence. It would've been a bit closer if he took the knight on f7 instead of moving.  I would've gotten a Queen, but he would've gotten a Knight and Rook, so it would've been pretty awesome, no?} Kg8 27. Nxd8+ {This Game is pretty much over. See? I was right that the whole not giving the King an escape hatch was a bad idea... not enough mobility for the king. It allows me to force out a series of moves leading to checkmate. looking back, Nf7 was his only chance to throw off the mating sequence, but would've thrown away his queen.} Kf8 28. Bd6+ {Next moves were: 28. ...        Qxd6 29. Qxd6  Kg8 30. Rxe8#  Thanks for the Game, CW! It was fun! (Oh, And the Boss is/was telling me that my annotations were a little harsh to you and that I have an asswhooping coming my way via him. Message me if there's anything you want me to add/remove, m'kay?)}
