[Opening "Gruenfeld (D92), 5.Bf4"]

1. d4 {My usual opening move.} Nf6 {My opponent chooses to play an Indian defense. } 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {I probably should have studied the Gruenfeld a bit more than I did. I was quite confident that I could play this opening well enough to at least get an equal position.} 4. Nf3 {cxd5 is considered the main line. I played this because I am sure that my opponent was a lot more prepared for that response than I was. } Bg7 5. Bf4 {This move made sense to me. I simply wanted to develop my DSB to a nice diagonal before playing e3.} c5 {Black offers a pawn in order to get some immediate pressure onto the c3 knight by moving the queen to a5 and then threatening something like Ne4.} 6. dxc5 Qa5 7. Rc1 {!? Perhaps an immediate cxd5 was best. I just wanted to make sure that my knight was protected.} Nc6 {!? Very bold move. I thought for a while about cxd5 followed by Nb4. My intuition told me that it would be wise not to do that because it would be quite difficult for white to defend all of these queenside attacks, so I played a logical move.} 8. e3 Ne4 9. Qc2 {? This only helps black do what he wants. Qb3 would have been best.} Bf5 {As now I have to go there anyways.} 10. Bd3 {?? Wow! I failed to do a blunder check. This loses quickly to Nb4.} Nb4 {Ouch.} 11. Qe2 Nxc3 {Opens up a discovered attack on the bishop.} 12. Rxc3 Bxc3+ 13. bxc3 Nxd3+ 14. Kf1 Nxf4 15. exf4 Qxc3 {And now after some exchanges I am down a whole rook. I was almost planning on resigning but I decided to see if I could finish it out.} 16. Kg1 {Preventing the bishop from pinning the queen to the king.} d4 {Now he thought that he was winning easily and began to play quite carelessly.} 17. Qe5 {This move was played with high hopes that black would castle king side. It would turn out to benefit me because I must strike hard and fast to have a chance.} O-O {And black does just that.} 18. h4 {Pushing my pawn in hopes of ripping open the h file for my rook.} Qxc4 19. h5 d3 {Black allows me to do this, but he is still winning right? There are not many pieces that can stop him from promoting that pawn.} 20. hxg6 fxg6 21. Ng5 {All or nothing. In fact, this loses quickly to 21...d2 22. Rxh7 d1=Q+ 23. Kh2 Rf6! White can't play 24. Qxe7 because of Qxf4+} d2 22. Rxh7 {This is as much as I could have hoped for, but as said previously, it loses. } Rf6 {? Now black must immediately give up the queen he has just won after 23. Qxe7 d1=Q+ 24. Kh2 Qh5+ 25. Rxh5. Of course the line still wins for black, just not as quickly.} 23. Qxe7 Qf1+ {?? Wow!! What a turn around. I guess my opponent thought O.K. I will still be up a piece after 24. Kxf1 d1=Q+ 25. Qe1 Qxe1+. However that is not the case.... } 24. Kh2 {! This Wins. Now black must play 24.... Qh1+ 25. Kxh1 d1=Q+ 26. Kh2 Qh5+ 27. Rxh5 gxh5 28. Qxf6 is easily winning for white.} Qh1+ {Forced.} 25. Kg3 {? I kicked myself a lot after I played this. I had not even thought about black's response. I am still winning, but the winning line is difficult to find.} Qxh7 {I had not anticipated this. I thought I would have a checkmate here... but alas I do not.} 26. Qxh7+ Kf8 27. Qh8+ {? Now this game should be a draw by repetition. After 27...Ke7 28. Qg7+ Ke8 29. Qg8+ Ke7 and so on. Best would have been 27. Qxb7! d1=Q 28. Nh7+ Kg8 29. Nxf6+ Kf8 30. Qxa8+ and then I could have simply pushed my c pawn.} Ke7 28. Qg7+ Ke8 29. Qxf6 {?? I did not even see Qg8+. I wrote it off quickly because I thought after 29...Rf8 there was not stopping promotion. But there was Qb3! Preventing the bishop from going to c2.} d1=Q {So now this is going to be  a very interesting endgame. I will be ahead 2 pawns, and my opponent will be ahead a bishop after 30. Qh8+ Kd7 31. Qxa8 Qg4+ 32. Kh2 Qxf4+ 33. Kg1 Qxg5 34. Qxa7} 30. Qf7+ {?! Waste of time I think. My objective was to drive the king as far away from the center as possible.} Kd8 31. Qf8+ Kc7 32. Qxa8 Qg4+ 33. Kh2 Qxf4+ 34. Kg1 Qxg5 35. Qxa7 {And so here we are. Black can win but must play precisely.} Be4 {Threatening checkmate. The only way to stop it is to play 36. Qb6+ Kb8 37. Qd6+ Ka7 38. Qg3 Qxc5. Losing a pawn would make black's winning chances much greater.} 36. Qb6+ Kb8 37. Qd6+ Ka8 {? This allows me to cut off the bishop and make its power limited. As far as my endgame knowledge goes, this should be a draw.} 38. f3 {! If Bxf3?? then Qf8+ forks the bishop and king.} Bc6 {Now as long as I defend my pawns I should be O.K. } 39. Kf2 Qh4+ 40. Kg1 Qe1+ 41. Kh2 Qe8 {Defends a draw by repetition and is looking to play Qh8+.} 42. Qf6 {Covers the h8 square.} Ka7 43. Qc3 Qe7 44. Qa5+ Kb8 45. Qc3 g5 46. Qh8+ Ka7 47. Qc3 Qc7+ 48. Kg1 Qg3 {So after shuffling our queens around for a few more moves, my opponent allows me to get a draw by repetition. } 49. Qa5+ Kb8 50. Qd8+ {Draw agreed. It is amazing how much a game can change. From losing to winning to drawn. My opponent let me come back from a bad start, and I just could not find the winning moves to finish him.}
