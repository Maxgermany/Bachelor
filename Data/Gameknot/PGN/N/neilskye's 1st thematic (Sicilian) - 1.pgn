1. e4 {This is a old-style Sveshnikov with 8..Rb8?, which White exploits rather well with a significant hiccup on move 19.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 6. Bg5 e5 7. Ndb5 {We have main position of the Sveshnikov Sicilian. Black nearly always follows with ..a6 and ..b5, when White meets ..b5 with Bxf6 and Nd5, exploiting the hole at d5. The rest of the game typically revolves around Black's "weaknesses" (usually holes at d5/b6/f5 and doubled f pawns after Bxf6 gxf6), while Black retains 2 bishops, ..f6-f5 ideas, and great activity.} a6 8. Na3 Rb8 {'?' - Really poor. Sveshnikov's innovation 8...b5! is absolutely best and this rickety old move, which has been abandoned entirely for 2 decades, gives White too much time in the center. Delaying this move is an option, but White actually prefers to bring the queen out (certainly ..gxf6 is welcome too!) in order to drive her off with tempo and complicate the Bf8 development in some lines (e.g. ..Qg6 halts ..g6, ..Qh4 must be wary of g3 ideas if ..Be7 is played (when the queen runs out of good squares), etc.)} 9. Bxf6 {'!? or ?!' - White doesn't have to cede the bishop pair here, as Black will respond ..Qxf6, but White's idea (or perhaps his "comfort zone" plan is more accurate!) revolves around controlling the center with pieces. To do so, The f6 knight needs to go.} Qxf6 10. Nc4 {'!?' - The immediate Nd5 is obvious and good, but this move intends to meet ..b5 with Ne3 (without c3 and Nc2), supporting d5 and hitting the important c4 square. If Black delays ..b5, the knight simply moves into b6 and suffocates the Black position (hopefully!)} Be6 11. Nb6 Nb4 {'?' - Inexplicable. Black's idea is....to lose time? After this, White is much better.} 12. a3 Nc6 13. Ncd5 Bxd5 14. Nxd5 Qh4 15. Qd3 {'!' A strong move, safeguarding e4 with the queen does not commit the f1 bishop to a passive role. In fact, White sees that after the useful g3 he can activate the bishop via h3 (h2-h4 may first be necessary), piercing the Black position. Certainly a much more active continuation. White does not intend to castle kingside at all. From this position White is basically won positionally after this move.} Rc8 16. g3 Qg5 {'?' A blunder in a bad position. Black underestimates the strength of Bh3. Much better was Qg5/Qh5, preventing the immediate development of this piece.} 17. Bh3 Rd8 18. Nc7+ Ke7 19. Qd5 {'??' - White is lulled to sleep by his dominating position and mating threats on the light squares. He underestimates the Black resource 19..Qh5!, gaining a vital tempo in defense. It then arises that White's knight is stuck on c7 and his bishop is attacked, and both cannot be defended. Then he has nothing better than Qb5, placing his queen en prise but forcing perpetual check. If the bishop is taken instead, then Qxb7 and perpetual again. White  blames such oversights to playing massive amounts of games (many against weaker players...there is no other way to start around here), which is a distraction. Never again, he says :)} Nd4 {'?'} 20. Qxb7 {This is winning for White, and White had calculated it through rather deeply after Qd5?? - how ironic. Also solid is 20.0-0.} f5 {A weak defense in a lost position. Black fears Ne6 , but the simple ..Qh5 (sound familiar?) forces White to find the complicated 21.Nb5  (the only move) to continue his attack via 22.Nxd4, since ..Qh5 threatens the simple ..Qe2# and also the h3 bishop.} 21. Nd5+ Ke6 22. c3 {Virtually any move wins here for White.} Nf3+ 23. Ke2 {The best square.} Qh5 {Black made this move then promptly resigned. It was prudent, as 24.Bxf5  or exf5  forces Qxf5 (and mate to follow).}
