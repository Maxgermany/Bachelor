1. e4 {This game features a Caro-Kann with opposite castles. This style of play has gained quite a recent following, one of the prominent players being GM Mihai Marin. } c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {The reasoning behind playing Nd2 instead of Nf3 is that if Black should chose a g6 system, c3 could be played opposing a solid pawn chain to the fianchettoed Bishop.} dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 {The classical main line.} 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 {After the more active Bf4, Qa5+ is best move to force the Bishop back to d2.} Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 {Here Qc7 is usually played, delaying the development of the f8 Bishop, which goes to d6 regularly. Sensing that Black was intending to castle short, I played a quite, noncommittal move.} 13. Kb1 O-O {Castling short is the CK is fraught with danger, the Kingside being slightly weaker than the Queenside, mainly because h6 is played. But if I was desperate to win with the CK as Black, I'd play like this, too.} 14. Ne4 {Here, I was intending to clear the g-pawn and also activate the g3 Knight or exchange it for a defending piece.} c5 {The main move against 14.Ne4 and a move that has scored quite well, in both my database and GK's one as well. The most popular reply for White is 15.dxc5, after which many pieces are exchanged and an endgame is reached where Black has more prospects than White, for a couple of reasons: h5 is weak, Black will have more center control and he will be more active on the Queenside than White.  No wonder 14.Ne4 is scoring pretty bad and Qe2 is the main move. That is, until I played my novelty.} 15. g4 {The proposed pawn sacrifice. Black certainly isn't forced to take it, but if he won't, the pawn will advance to g5, further weakening the Black monarch's castle position.  This move wasn't played before on GK, at least it wasn't recorded in the database, and in my database, I could only find one game where Black accepted the sacrifice and subsequently won.} Nxg4 {The most principled move. Black has many defensive resources here and White certainly isn't winning but he gets a strong initiative for his invested material.} 16. Rhg1 {Not wasting any time and aiming the Rook directly at the Black King.} f5 {This is more or less forced, anything else loses very fast.  Just a few example of lesser moves: 16...Ngf6 17.Bxh6 Nxh5 18.dxc5 Ndf6 19.Bxg7 Nxg7 20.Qe3 16...Ndf6 17.Nxf6+ Nxf6 18.Bxh6 Nxh5 19.Ng5 Bxg5 20.Rxg5 16...Kh8 17.Rxg4 f5 18.Bxh6 fxg5 19.Neg5 Rf5 20.Nxe6} 17. Bc3 {This is the actual novelty and improvement over 17.Qc4 which was played in my database game. It offers a whole piece for the attack. White isn't winning here, but he has a lot of threats, especially if Black dares to take the piece.} fxe4 {The cat is out of the bag now, but one can hardly blame Black for taking the very active Knight. After the text move, White has the initiative.} 18. Qxe4 {For the piece, White has a number of direct threats, the Ng4 and the e6 are attacked by the Queen. A nasty discovery is looming on the d-file, the Bishop and the g-file Rook are taking aim at Kg8 and to top it all, the Knight on f3 is poised to reach a nice snuggle position on g6.  White's position is much better and Black is only hanging by a thread.} Ndf6 {Black connects the Knights, he keeps the g-file closed, but at the same time, he removes one piece from the d-file so that only a pawn now separates the White Rook and the Black Queen. The Ng4 is also in the air.  It's really hard to find a move for Black here. Perhaps liquidating some material with 18...Rxf3 19.Qxf3 Ngf6 20.dxc5 Qc7, but after 21.Qg2, things look grim.} 19. Qxe6+ Kh8 {After 19...Rf7, White could play 20.Ne5 Qe8 21.Nxg4 Nxg4 22.Qxg4, recovering the piece but keeping the attack. After 19...Kh7, White could play again 20.Ne5 Qc8 (20...Nxf2 fails to 21.Qf5+) 21.Qxe7 Nd5 22.Qd6 Nxc3+ 23.bxc3 Rf6 24.Qd5 Nxf2 25.Rdf1} 20. Nh4 {Black's position is hard but not completely lost, he could still hold on with 20...Qd6 21.Ng6+ Kh7 22.Qf5 Kg8 23.Nxf8 Rxf6 24.Rxg4 Nxg4 25.Qxg4 Qf4  A premature resignation to say the least.}
