[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 {This was a casual game. Playing the white pieces, I didn't want to play against the Sicilian or French defence, knowing my opponent,  so I started with 1. d4} e6 { } 2. c4 {Again avoiding the French defence, after 2. e4  d5.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. e3 {So we've reached the Nimzo Indian defence.  When playing this opening with white, I prefer the Rubenstein variation 4.e3} O-O {Black chooses to play c5 later on.} 5. Bd3 {In the Rubenstein attack white has it's light squared bishop positioned on d3, aiming at h7.} d5 6. cxd5 exd5 7. Nf3 {7.Ng-e2 is more common in this opening.} b6 {? Regarding the previous note, black should 've tried 7.Bg4, stopping white from playing Qc2.} 8. O-O Bb7 9. Qc2 {!} c5 {Threatening ...c4!} 10. a3 Ba5 11. Bd2 a6 12. Ne2 {The white pieces slowly head towards the kingside.} Bxd2 13. Nxd2 {If 13.Qxd2, I feared black would play 13...c4 and 14....Ne4.} c4 { ! Now white's bishop can no longer control the diagonal.} 14. Bf5 g6 {!} 15. Bh3 Nbd7 {Finally developing the knight.} 16. f3 {? This move terribly weakens the pawn e3. Black wastes no time taking advantage of it. } Re8 17. g4 {A dubious pawn sacrifice for wich I hoped to get some attacking chances.} Rxe3 18. Nf4 Qc7 19. Ng2 Re2 20. f4 {This move now weakens the e4 square, wich can now be used by the black knight to infiltrate the white camp. But it's all part of my plan to attack the black pawn structure on the kingside.} Ne4 21. Rad1 Re8 22. Qc1 {! The white Queen is now positioned to move to square h6.} Nxd2 23. Rxd2 Re2e4 24. Rdf2 {!? A second pawn sacrifice! This time the goal is more obvious. The diagonal is  cleared for the Queen.} Rxd4 25. f5 {! The diagonal is cleared. Again the pawn move weakens the e5 square, but white threatens to play 26. f6! and then Qh6 is desastrous for black.} Ne5 {? } 26. f6 {!! The f-pawn is the hero of the game! } Nxg4 {?! Black wins yet another pawn, but by now it is clear it's not getting him anywhere.} 27. Bxg4 Rxg4 28. Qh6 {! Finally, I've realised my plan. Mate on g7 is inevitable and it seems like Alex didn't have a clue what was going on.} Rxg2+ {?! Time for desperate measures....} 29. Kxg2 { ! Avoiding black's last trick. If 29.Rxg2? black plays 29..Qc5 ! and 30..Qf8 . Now black only has a final discovered check before losing to Qg7 mate!} d4+ 30. Kg1 {And black resigned.  }
