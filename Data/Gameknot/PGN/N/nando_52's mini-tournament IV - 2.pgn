1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 3. e3 Qb6 4. b3 {?! This is a waste of time – it is better to simply develop with 4. Nc3. (4. Nc3 Qxb2? 5. Nb5! +-)} e6 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. c3 Be7 7. Nbd2 {? Bd3 followed by 0-0 is natural and good. The text leaves the Kingside undeveloped, undefends the c-pawn and allows a fork on d5.} Nd5 { Threatening …Nxc3 and …Nxf4; exf4 cxd4} 8. Nc4 {! The best choice. White will still lose material, but will have more active pieces and pressure on the dark squares. Black should still be better, but will have to work hard.} Qd8 9. Nd6+ {? White takes another tempo to trade off the Knight he just gave up a pawn to put on c4. 9. dxc5 Nxc3 10. Qd3 (or 9. Bd6) would be much better.} Bxd6 10. Bxd6 Nxc3 11. Qd2 {?? Missing Black's reply while overestimating the danger of …Qa5. 11. Qc2 Qa5 12. Qd2! and now …Ne4 is met by taking the Black Queen.} Ne4 12. Qc2 Nxd6 13. Qxc5 Ne4 {! Black doesn't sit back and relax down a piece, but goes for the throat: the Queenside dark squares.} 14. Qc2 Qa5+ 15. Nd2 f5 {! A quiet move to maintain the pressure.} 16. a3 {?! A waste of time, since b4 is unplayable. White needs to be extremely careful in untangling himself: 16. Bd3?? is met by …Nb5 17. Qb1 Nxd2 18. Kxd2 b6! and White is in even deeper trouble.} b6 17. b4 {?? Not seeing the pin.} Nxb4 {White timed out here, and proceeded to lose the rest of his tournament games by time-out, but Black is clearly winning.}
