1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. d4 Qa5 6. Nf3 Bf5 7. O-O e6 8. Bd3 {The first "option" by white. It never mind, my respose will be the same.} Bg6 9. Ne5 Bd6 {The threat Bb4, BxN, Qxc3, doesn't work, because of Rxb7. This is the best place for the bishop. } 10. Bd2 Qc7 11. f4 {Best for white. } Ne7 {Protecting f5.} 12. Ne4 Bxe4 {I preferred to lose the lsb instead of the dsb. Not sure if it is wise.} 13. Bxe4 Nd7 {Not f5. e3 must not be left weak in this opening, by any mean. } 14. c4 {It seems that I will lose my dsb. But the "price" for white would be to move c5, avoiding for a good while the dangerous d5.} Nf6 15. Bf3 Ng6 {Nf5 would have been preferable. I wanted to force the game into the black diagonal, mantaining a Nxf5 possibility open. The mistake is that in doing so, I left the way open for f5. } 16. c5 {Fortunately, white prefer to cash the bishop's exchange and lose the possibility of a d5 break. Of course I'm not happy to leave the bishop's pair to my opponent, but...} Be7 {This move deprives f7 of a defender (Q). Besides, BxN, fxB is ok for me (no f5 break), and dxB allows o-o-o, pinning the bishop. So, definitely, Be7 was bad. } 17. Qc2 {Maybe preparing f5. But I think should have not waited to prepare, but play f5 as a sac. Re1 is powerful, afterwards. } O-O-O {Tired to struggle, I decided to try an exchange sac, hoping to open the position} 18. Be3 {Worrying about Rxd4. } Nd5 {Food for thoughts.} 19. Bxd5 Rxd5 {Problem is solved. My only price would be f7, but this is affordable.} 20. Nxf7 Rf8 21. Ng5 {Now, my beloved dsb is out of the game, helpless... and it decides to make the best of himself by killing the nasty white knight.} Bxg5 22. fxg5 Rff5 {Probably Rd-f5 would have been much better. Anyway, I was just hoping for a draw, here. } 23. Rxf5 Rxf5 {I prefer white, here, but my position is solid, at the moment. White pawn's are my best defence, since they make the dsb almost useless (white would try to fight for occupying with the bishop the big black diagonal).} 24. Rf1 {The exchange makes me group my pawns again, true. But it leaves open the d5 threat. I will fight for keep it there, well defended (in a white square).} Qf7 25. Rxf5 exf5 {To be honest, I changed my mind here, just because with the queens on the board, some interest could be found in this game.} 26. Qb3 {Playing for draw?} Qxb3 {Much better would have been Qe8 (Kf2, f4...). I admit my plans were not clear, at this point. } 27. axb3 f4 28. Bd2 Kd7 29. Kf2 Ke6 30. Kf3 Kf5 31. g4+ {And this is the interesting part. } Kxg5 32. b4 {I expected: Bxf5, NxB, h4+, Kxh4, KxN. Is white winning in this position? The doubled pawns are really a problem for white, and d5 implies a lost race. And if the white king leaves unattended g4, and the black king and pawns alone, white will lose...} Nh4+ {Ok, so my turn. } 33. Kf2 Kxg4 {Things look pretty good for black, now.} 34. h3+ Kf5 {! Instead of taking the pawn (I could have done it), this moves means that d4 will fall. And all black pawns can easily be on white squares, so no way to fight for white. He resigned. }
