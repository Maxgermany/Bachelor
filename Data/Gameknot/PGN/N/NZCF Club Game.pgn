1. e4 {Another OTB game and the final game of the tournament. I have managed to string together a few wins and am looking pretty close to the top of the list of my grade. If I win this game and the current leader doesn't then I would at least have a share of the top spot. } Nf6 {Alekhine's defence. I notice that when I play this OTB, my opponents tend to raise an eyebrow and look a bit uncomfortable. } 2. Nc3 {And (unlike on GK) this seems to be the most common response. I suspect trying to avoid unfamiliar territory. } d5 {Keeping my opponent uncomfortable hopefully!} 3. e5 {Now it becomes the Spielmann variation.} Nfd7 {Also playable is 3...d4, it often leads to the violent follow on of: 4. exf6 dxc3 5. fxg7 cxd2+ 6. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 7. Bxd2 Bxg7 after which I think white has the better of it.  } 4. d4 {Poking a pawn out to defend e5, release the DSB and claim some more of the centre. } e6 {Defending d5 and opening some dark diagonals. } 5. Nf3 {Developing and adding some fortification to white's advanced centre. This is a strong knight, which Black is often prepared to give up the bishop pair to remove - however in this line Blacks LSB isn't going to make it anywhere near that knight for quite some time. } c5 {Looking to undermine White's advanced central pawns. } 6. Bd3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nxe5 {White's central pawns have fallen, and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development, but I think Black has the edge for now. } 8. Bf4 {Looking to develop further with tempo.} Qf6 {Seems early to send forth the queen while the back rank is looking so full, but in this case I think it is justified. Nd7 would have been the only safe square for the knight and White's massive lead in development would more than compensate for the pawn.  } 9. Bg3 Bc5 {Catching up on development. Challenging for the centre, and looking through the knight towards White's f pawn. } 10. Ndb5 {Threatening a knight fork at c7.} Na6 {I gave 10...Ng4 piling up on the f pawn, a good hard look, but White can ward off the threat with Qf3 after a check at c7, securing a rook. Nxd3 doesn't fare any better. } 11. Qe2 {This move adds protection to the f-pawn, creates a threat to the knight at e5, and gives white the option of castling long. } Nxd3+ {There didn't seem to be an efficient way of defending the knight, nor moving it to safety. This gets rid of White's bishop pair, and maintains pressure on f2.} 12. Qxd3 O-O {Dulling the threat of Nc7. It seemed that this move needed to happen sooner or later anyway. } 13. O-O {Renewing protection for f2, and connecting the rooks. } Bd7 {Clearing the back rank and asking the knight the question. } 14. Nd6 {The White Knight is happy to swap, but for a different bishop. Also attacking b7.} Bc6 {Defending b7, but more importantly, loading a weapon on the a8-h1 diagonal. } 15. Rfe1 {Seizing control of the e file.} Nb4 {Bringing the knight closer to the action. Threatening the queen and the rook fork at c2. } 16. Qe2 Qg6 {This move provides support for the knight to jump on c2, but the real threat is after 17...Bxd6 18.Bxd6 d4 threatening both the knight at c3 and mate on f2.} 17. Rac1 Bxd6 18. Bxd6 {This fork wasn't feared due to the previously mentioned line. } d4 {As planned. } 19. Ne4 {The knight is able to avoid its own threat whilst interposing the threat of mate at g2, but it isn't enough to save it. } f5 {THe knight is pinned to its fate. } 20. f3 fxe4 21. fxe4 {White doesn't take advantage of the fork yet, and for good reason. If instead BxN or BxR then exf3 and the pawn is going to be a real problem for White. This is a safer option, and of corse the fork is still there. } Nxa2 {Getting some compensation for the knight. By attacking the White rook, White must either exchange rooks  equally, or spend time trapping the Black knight, allowing the Black rook to escape. } 22. Rca1 {The better option. } Rf6 {Here I considered both Rf7 and Rf6. After considering it quite considerably I decided on Rf7. I then proceeded to move my rook to the wrong square...} 23. Rxa2 {White seems to have emerged from the worst of the attack, relatively unscathed. Black does still hold the edge however. } Rf7 {Putting the rook where it was supposed to go on the last move... Avoiding Be5 of course. } 24. b4 {I think this move may have been to prevent a6 followed by Bb5 for black. } b5 {THis move was probably a bit of a "knee-jerk" but I don't think its too bad. } 25. Qd3 {Threatening to chew up a pawn. } Rd8 {I figured that the pawn was safe. If 26.Qxd4, then ...Rfd7 and White's bishop can't be saved due to the pin on the e4 pawn.  } 26. Bg3 {Interrupting the Black queen's view of g2.} Rdf8 {Piling up on the f file. Although this leaves d4 hanging, this enables Black's bishop to safely take on e4 - If the White queen takes on d4 then she neglects her defence of f1, meaning the e1 rook is powerless to leave the back rank to capture on e4 or else Rf1# } 27. Qxd4 Bxe4 {This also threatens c2, pins the white bishop, and threatens Rf2. } 28. c3 {This protects c2, but more importantly it allows the rook to keep a defensive eye on g2. } Qf5 {Piling up on the the f file threatening mate at f1. Bc2 was another option here to refresh the threat of Rf2.} 29. h3 {Giving the king some breathing space.} Qg6 {But leaving the bishop pinned and undefended.} 30. Rae2 Qxg3 {Perhaps it wasn't best to exchange - I just couldn't see anything better. } 31. Qxe4 {Now it's White's turn to have all the heavies lined up. } Qxc3 32. Qxe6 Qxb4 {Black's immediate threats seem to have been warded off again, but now there are two connected passed pawns, that should save the day. } 33. Rf2 {I didn't feel that this move itsself was really threatening much. Probably in preparation for Ref1 after which White looks more dangerous.  Black finds himself at a fork in the road - 33...Qxe1+ 34.Qxe1 Rxf2 35.Qa5 and Black will end up with 2 rooks and a passed pawn vs White's Queen. I suspect this was probably "right" move by Black, However... } Qc5 {... I couldn't see how to win the endgame. This move pins the White rook at f2, and forces White to defend it. The strategy at this point was to create an impenetrable fortress for the King, and then set about marching the pawns down the board. } 34. Ree2 {I'm not sure if this is better than Ref1 or not. Ref1 doesn't immediately create any real threat whilst the f2 Rook is pinned. But this does leave the option for Black to play Qc1+ at some point to reposition the queen at some point. Qc1 isn't doesn't seem to be useful just now though. } a5 {It doesn't seem that White can break through, so Black starts pushing. } 35. Kh2 {Breaking the pin.} a4 {It seemed that White can only swap off pieces here, which seems just fine for Black with two connected, passed pawns charging towards the end of the board. } 36. Rxf7 Rxf7 {One set of rook off the board. } 37. Qe8+ Qf8 {The fortress remains and White will have to exchange more pieces to be able to cause Black any real trouble. The other option of course was 37...Rf8 38.Qe6+ Kh8, but it seemed like Black would need to be careful. } 38. Qe6 {Pinned again. } Qe7 {Unfortunately this happened. Nothing more than a simple miscalculation.} 39. Qxe7 Rxe7 40. Rxe7 {It was a shame for this game to end like this, I was looking forward to trying to find my way through a quite an unfamiliar endgame towards what I had hoped could be a win. Thanks for reading my annotation - please leave comments/feedback.  }
