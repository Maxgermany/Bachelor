[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nf3 c5 4. c3 {After black moves the c pawn, white must move his own in order to defend b2 with the queen after Qb6 by black. No matter if black goes c4.} Qb6 5. Qc2 {This seems actually a mistake, since it seems possible for black to go Bf5 now, based on the weakness of b2 (Qxb2 and the rook is lost).  BUT for Qc1# by white. Black can't take the rook at once, but has white compensation for it? I'm sure theory says a lot from this, but I don't read books, so I don't know. I appreciate some help...} cxd4 6. cxd4 {With an obvious threat, QxB#. It is possible to take wiht the knight, and probably better, since the key of white's game is to shield the queenside... but it becomes pretty naked now. } Nc6 7. e3 {It was profilactic a3, since the diagonal is weak. } Nb4 {Here it comes. Be calm. } 8. Qb3 {No advantage from Qa4+, it only helps him to develop. } Bf5 {Good, of course. Now the bishop and the knight are coordinated. I have to react. } 9. Na3 {Giving a plus to c2. } Rc8 {Increasing the pressure. But here, probably a6 would have been better for black, since this allows me to...} 10. Bb5+ Nc6 {This is another story...} 11. Rc1 {My turn to press him. My rook is undefended, but also is his, and I'm taking it with check...} e6 {Pawn's symmetry... it looks drawish. } 12. Ne5 {Trying to get something out from all this. } Bxa3 {Gaining tempoes for castling, accepting to lose the bishop's pair. It's a fair exchange. Now it was possible 13. BxN+, and balck has to go bxc6. Then, QxBa3 and black can't castle. It looks simple now, but during the game a lot of lines came up, with slight differences... and sometime, those little differences are THE differences. } 13. bxa3 O-O 14. O-O {It was interesting g4, sac a pawn in order to penetrate: g4, Nxg4, Nd7!, or g4, Bxg4, NxB, NxN, Bd6, Rmoves, Bc5, Qmoves, BxNc6, anything takes, Bxa7 or . A very tricky way to mix up the game, I should have tried it. But I dind't see it during the game.  } Nxe5 15. Bxe5 {The normal plan it dxe5, but not now, I need solidity, no attack is going on on black's king. } Ne4 16. Bd7 {Let's see if this can compensate. } Qxb3 {This settles my pawns back, a step more to draw. } 17. axb3 Rc3 {an interesting try. The truth is that black pieces can build some tricks...} 18. f3 {...so let's try to mix up things a little. This is interesting, since opens the tactic again. Black can go RxR, or Rxe6, fxN, Bxe4, still threatening b3. } Rxc1 19. Rxc1 Nf6 20. Rc7 {My turn. Now whitehas an edge, and due to a "slight difference", I win a pawn... that can be the difference. But in doing this, I give up my bishop pair, wihtout realizing the engame will be from opposite bishops... and this calls for a drawn. } Nxd7 21. Rxd7 f6 22. Bd6 Ra8 {Now the loss of a pawn materializes. } 23. Rxb7 a6 24. g4 Bd3 25. Re7 {All these manouvers trying to get something more concrete from the position, but the truth is that black is playing very consistently, and doesn't "fall" in tricks. } Rc8 {If I take his pawn, his rook will revenge on my pawns somehow. That was what I thought. } 26. Bc5 e5 27. Rd7 {This was the idea, since his bishop can't defend the pawn. Was this "the little small difference" I looked for?} e4 28. Rxd5 {I'm sure the pawn in f3 would be mine...} exf3 {Two central pawns, one passed, one more. This should be enough to win, so I messed it up somewhere, but I can't see where. } 29. g5 Rc6 30. h4 fxg5 {oh, yes, TWO free pawns...} 31. hxg5 Re6 {...maybe, just maybe, his king is very uneasy to move... let's see. I'll take the f3 pawn with my rook. He will take the g5, but hey, my free pawns will came first. } 32. Rd8+ Kf7 33. Rf8+ Kg6 34. Rxf3 Kxg5 35. Rg3+ Kf6 36. Bf8 {Was this a good plan? Probably not. I looked hard for a tricky mate, but I miss a tempo and the h pawn.  } g6 37. Rf3+ Bf5 {This is closing up, and I can't see it easy to win. I'm looking for something to alter the equilibrium... maybe...} 38. d5 {The pawn can't be threatened and blocked at the same time. } Re8 {But the bishop can. } 39. Bc5 Ke5 40. d6 {This pawn is on the 6th, untouchable, as my bishop. And it is still not enough to win? Come on...} h5 {Here he goes...} 41. Rf4 Kd5 42. b4 Rh8 43. Rd4+ Kc6 {Maybe, here I can find the way to materialize....} 44. e4 Be6 {I am realizing that I am playing a fool, since it becomes clear that I cannot push the pawn further. So I tried a last way to scramble the game: to sac it.} 45. d7 Bxd7 46. Rd6+ Kc7 {It was interesting Rxa6, Re8, e5 and black can't take it, but a player like my opponent won't fall for such a cheap trick.} 47. Rxg6 Kb7 48. e5 {A step is a step. But I'm looking to b8...} Re8 49. Rb6+ Kc8 50. Bd6 {Do you see why? Still, it is not enough to win. } Bb5 {Now, probably, my worst mistake. Or not, I can't tell...} 51. Rb8+ Kd7 52. Rxe8 Kxe8 53. e6 {Preventing the king to go out, but is futile.} Kd8 54. Kh2 Kc8 55. Kg3 Be8 56. Kf4 Kb7 57. Ke5 {Here, I saw the last trick, based on the sac of a3. } Kc6 58. Bc5 Kb5 59. Kd4 Ka4 60. Kc3 Bb5 {But black, once again, "sees" it. The game is over. } 61. Kb2 h4 62. e7 h3 63. Bd6 Be8 64. Kc3 Bb5 65. Kd4 Kxa3 66. Kd5 Ka4 67. Kc5 a5 {A great game... and maybe some day I will be able to learn what it is teaching me. }
