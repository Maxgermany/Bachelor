1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just had another tough game against The Dentist.  I managed to win a pawn early on in the game, but alas, in the middlegame I went for another side pawn, the a pawn with my rook, only to allow my opponent to control the e file with his rook which had near devastating consequences ...... for me.  Luckily my opponent did not make the best moves and just could not resist giving a check - now here is another example of The Perils of Giving Check - it did not quite have the devastating consequences for the Dentist as it did my buddy Bob Jacobs but it did cede the initiative in my favour and then I eventually won the game which starts off as a Nimsovich Defense, i.e. Nc6 in response to 1. e4.  Master Freddy has been known to play this with varying success.  One last word before I launch into the game - here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game here:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13914788&rnd=0.18665816909941102} Nc6 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 {3. d4 - an attempt to gain control of the centre.} d5 4. Nbd2 h6 5. c3 Nf6 6. e5 {6. e5 - pawn wedge.} Ne4 7. Bd3 a6 {7. ...... a6? - a mistake which loses a pawn, you will see how ....} 8. Nxe4 dxe4 9. Bxe4 {9. Bxe4 - like this.} f5 10. exf6 e.p. Qxf6 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 {11. ...... bxc6 - after a bishop trade black has queenside pawn islands to go with his 1 pawn deficit.} 12. Ne5 Bd7 13. Qf3 Rh7 14. Qe4 {14. Qe4 - this move looks strong but black initiates a queen trade under somewhat less favourable circumstances for me - I was eyeing up that weak pawn on c6 btw.} Qf5 15. Qxf5 exf5 16. Nxd7 Kxd7 {16. ..... Kxd7 - another set of minor pieces are traded off and the BK is in the centre.  I must now develop Fou Lenoir.} 17. Be3 Re8 18. O-O-O {18. 0-0-0 - and castle queenside.} g5 {18. ...... g5 - pawn roll.} 19. Rhe1 f4 20. Bd2 {20. Bd2 - and Fou Lenoir is forced back.} Ree7 21. Rxe7+ Bxe7 {21. ....... Bxe7 - after the trade of one set of rooks The Dentist does not take back with his rook.  He has no desire for Re1 forcing either a rook trade or a concession of the e column.} 22. Re1 {22. Re1 - I occupy the e column anyway.} Rf7 23. Re5 {23. Re5 - the start of a plan to round up the pawn on a6.} f3 24. g3 {24. g3 - keeping my kingside pawn structure together.} Bd6 25. Ra5 {25. Ra5 - oh dear, it looks as though I will win another pawn but alas my greed will result in the rook invasion mentioned in my intro notes.} Re7 26. Kd1 {26. Kd1?! - here Gameknot Analysis suggested Rf5, please refer to the link in my intro notes for further detail.  My priority is not to allow that f3 pawn to crown.  Note, if 26. Be3?? instead of Kd1 then Rxc3!!, 27. fxc3 f2 and there is no way I can prevent the f pawn from crowning.  Note if 28. Rf5 then black can play Bf5 29. Rxf5 gxf5 and the pawn promotion is only delayed and not prevented.  Chillingly I had put Fou Lenoir on e3 but just before I clicked submit I saw that sac and pressed reset and moved Henry to d1 instead thus avoiding a humiliating loss against Class D oppo.} Re2 27. Be3 Rxb2 28. Rxa6 {28. Rxa6 - might as well.} Rb1+ {28. ....... Rb1+?! - The Dentist cannot resist giving a check, but it is not a good one because Fou Lenoir can safely block it!} 29. Bc1 h5 30. Ra5 Be7 {30. ...... Be7 - protecting his g5 pawn.} 31. Kc2 Rb5 32. Rxb5 cxb5 {32. ...... cxb5 - a rook trade tidying up black's queenside pawns.} 33. h3 {33. h3 - vital to stop the BK from eating my kingside pawns by coming in via the c8-h3 diagonal.} g4 34. hxg4 hxg4 {34. ..... hxg4 - this pawn trade means the BK cannot approach my pawns from the front, only from behind and they will no doubt be protected by Henry and Fou Lenoir.  Still, I have plenty of work to do if I want to bring home the win.} 35. Kd3 c5 36. dxc5 Bxc5 {36. ...... Bxc5 - pawn trade.} 37. Be3 Ba3 {37. ..... Ba3 - The Dentist has enough knowledge of endgames to know not to exchange down into a K & P ending here with a pawn minus.  Henry now moves towards the kingside pawns - he senses a fine supper there, p(r)awns with garlic and a lovely side salad - truly fit for a king!} 38. Ke4 Bd6 39. Kf5 Kc6 40. Kxg4 Kd5 {40. ..... Kd5 - While Henry is busily tucking into that fine repast, the BK now heads towards the centre to create some problems.} 41. Kxf3 Kc4 42. Bd2 Kd3 43. Be1 Bc5 {43. ..... Bc5 - Incredible, the Dentist is now 3 pawns down but as he has one pawn left and the queenside pawns also look likely to drop off to the BK I have a bad feeling I may have to sac Fou Lenoir to prevent a crowning on the queenside.  If that happens that may mean one thing ...... Low Draw ....... to a Class D player.} 44. g4 {44. g4 - for the want of anything better I decided to push up my g pawn.} Kc2 {44. ...... Kc2 - the BK goes after my a2 pawn but this allows Henry to move to e2, protecting Fou Lenoir and allowing my f pawn to advance.  Two connected passers are gonna be a real handful for the BK and black dsb.} 45. Ke2 Be7 {45. ..... Be7 - trying in vain to hold up my passers.} 46. f4 Kb2 47. g5 {47. g5 - up they go, 3 more squares to Glendadom!} Kxa2 48. Bd2 {48. Bd2 - Fou Lenoir now lends his support to the passers.} Kb3 49. f5 Kc4 {49. ..... Kc4 - after snaffling my a2 pawn as predicted the BK rushes after my kingside pawns.} 50. f6 Bf8 {50. .... Bf8?? - this move finally puts the nail in the Dentist's coffin.  He should have played Be8 - suggested by Gameknot Analysis which would have held up the pawns.} 51. g6 {51. g6 - here, it is now becoming obvious that in a few moves time, Henry will be having a tearful reunion with his beloved missus, Glenda.  Henry was denied that reunion, however, by my opponent who waved the white flag - although I won this game there is plenty more room for improvement here.  Ah well, hope you have had a good read, bye for now - Joanne}
