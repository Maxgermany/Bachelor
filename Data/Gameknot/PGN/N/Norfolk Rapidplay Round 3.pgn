1. Nf3 d5 {Reti} 2. d4 Nf6 {Transposing to the regular d4, Nf4, Nf3, d5} 3. Bf4 Bf5 4. e3 e6 {I'm not copying, this is my preferred set up in this opening!} 5. c4 Bb4+ 6. Nc3 Ne4 {Has to be worth doing} 7. Qb3 {The correct way to defend the knight.} Qe7 {Only after the game did I realise this drops the d-pawn!} 8. a3 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 c6 10. cxd5 exd5 11. c4 {The right move sequence. Pressuring me before I'm ready} Be6 {The best way to defend the pawn.} 12. Bd3 O-O {How about dxc4 here? Decided to take the easy option} 13. c5 {closing up the centre and opening up possibilites of a siege of b7} Re8 {Probably better of pressuring b7 IMO..} 14. Qc2 Bf5 15. Ne5 {Threatening f3 winning the bishop} Bg6 {Also considering g5 here..} 16. Nxg6 hxg6 17. f3 g5 {A mistake. I'll be totally honest. For some reason I missed Bxb8. I considered every other possible bishop move but missed Bxb8!} 18. Bxb8 Nxc5 {Luckily I can pick a couple of pawns up for the peice} 19. Be5 Nxd3+ 20. Qxd3 f6 21. Bg3 Qxe3+ 22. Qxe3 Rxe3+ 23. Kd2 Rb3 {Rather than Rae8, Rhe1.} 24. Rhb1 {Forcing a rook swap.  White - 8 minutes Black  - 11 minutes} Rxb1 25. Rxb1 b6 26. Re1 Kf7 {Killing off the rooks options on the open file} 27. Bd6 {Threatening Re7 } Rd8 {Re7 , Kf8, and no discovered check works as the rook is on the bishop and Bb4 falls to a5.} 28. Bb4 {Probably the best bet} Rd7 {Stopping Re7 } 29. Rc1 {Attacking the c-pawn} Rc7 30. a4 Rc8 31. Kd3 g6 {White - 2 minutes Black  - 5 minutes} 32. Rc2 Rc7 {Draw Agreed. White cannot win it in the time he has left and I have no winning options on the board.}
