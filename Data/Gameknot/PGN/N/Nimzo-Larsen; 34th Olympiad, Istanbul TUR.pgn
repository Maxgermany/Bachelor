[Opening "Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01), modern variation"]

1. b3 {This move is the common opening move in the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, although white can also start with Nf3. The alternate move Nf3 prevents black from moving e5, which is black's strongest response to b3. } e5 {Black is eager to take control of the center.} 2. Bb2 {The bishop is preparing for fianchetto, already with significant pressure on the central e5 pawn. Interesting to note that the DSB and the e5 pawn are locked in tension for much of the game. } Nc6 {Black responds with a typical knight development move, defending the pawn and staking claim on the dark central squares.} 3. e3 {There are multiple variations after Nc6. Common ones include: c4, e5, Nf3, and g3 among the most popular (not in any particular order). The move 3. e3 opens the LSB line while leaving the option for d4 keeping the opponent guessing. Having the luxury of game study, I think White here is interested in increasing the LSB's scope.} d5 {Black moves in to claim more territory in the center. However, this leaves the knight on c6 susceptible to pin.} 4. Bb5 {White takes advantage of the weakness. This move simultaneously attacks the knight and the e5 pawn. } Bd6 {Black's DSB is forced to protect the pawn. } 5. f4 {White continues the central pressure adding another attacker to the e5 assault.} Qe7 {Black adds the queen to the defense. One might wonder why not f6? If black 5... f6 first, the black flank is open to a quick 6. Qh5+. This move is easily countered by g6, however, the kingside pawn damage is done inhibiting a successful castle.} 6. Nf3 {White brings in more pressure to the e5. The flank attack is building now applying significant central pressure. However, white now has now limited his queen's scope a bit.} f6 {Now white can now add the f6 pawn defender without fear of the Qh5+ threat.} 7. Nc3 {White brings his other knight into play. While this reduces the scope of the DSB, it is a natural development move. This sometimes provides white the possibility of a discovered attack on the black king side rook, although that does not occur in this game.} Be6 {Black develops the LSB, defending the d5 pawn. } 8. O-O {White uses this opportunity to castle bringing the rook into play. Preparing for the eventual e file action. } Nh6 {Black moves to castle king side now. I do not see any other value in this move.} 9. fxe5 {White begins the central attack sequence. } fxe5 { Exchange.} 10. e4 {White now moves in to break up the central structure. } dxe4 {Black counterattacks and threatens the knight. Black might have alternatively moved d4, threatening the other knight. However, this results in the black king side weakening further when white moves Nd5 and attacks the queen. I'm not sure which is the better move. I would personally not have created the isolated pawn, but that's probably my personal fear at work. The isolated pawn will require constant defense attention from this point until its off the board. } 11. Nxe4 {White takes the knight. This is one of the beautiful things about the fianchetto'd bishop. Now, with one move, white has created two separate threats on the black DSB and the e5 pawn. However, this move has created two weak points as well. The white LSB and the knight at e4 are both undefended.} O-O {Black castles bringing a rook to the semi-open e file.} 12. Bxc6 {White picks off one of the e5 pawn defenders.} bxc6 {Black takes the bishop doubling the pawns creating a weak pawn on c6. Notice black's pawn structure is pretty much in disarray with four separate islands.} 13. Qe2 {White connects the rooks and brings the queen into the game.} Bg4 {Black pins the knight attempting to stop white from moving Ng5 leaving the king vulnerable on the diagonal.} 14. Qc4+ {White recognizes the advantage and check attacks the c6 pawn relieving the knight pin and gaining a tempo.} Kh8 {Black corners the king. If black moves Be6 instead, this forces white to do exactly what he want to do, take the pawn at c6. Moving the king and keeping the pressure on the knight forces white to address the knight first.} 15. Nfg5 {Which he does. Now, white's knight is currently uncontested on the 5th row. This removes the threat at f3 and further pressuring the black king side.} Bd7 {Black brings the bishop back to guard the c6 pawn. The defensive energy required to take care of these pawns is a large factor in the game's outcome. Black has two bishops entirely engaged in guarding three pawns, while white's sole bishop is fundamentally offensive. } 16. Rae1 {White brings the rook to the e file to threaten the queen.} Nf5 {I didn't really understand this move. I would have expected Rae8 instead. I think black wanted to bring his knight into the game and eventually move h6 to kick the knight.} 17. Nf3 {Anticipating the kick, white brings the knight back and continues the e5 pressure.} Rae8 {Black brings the rook into play now. The action is on the e file now.} 18. Nf2 {White brings the knight back, applying indirect pressure to the black queen.} Be6 {Black brings the LSB into play threatening the queen. This insulates the black queen a bit, but again allows white to capture the c6 pawn.} 19. Qxc6 {Capture.} Nd4 {Black brings the knight around to threaten the queen forcing an exchange. I believe the black thought may have been to remove the strong DSB and activate the black bishop pair.} 20. Bxd4 {Capture} exd4 {Capture} 21. Ne4 {The d4 pawn isn't going anywhere, no need to capture yet. Instead, I think white wants to exchange the bishops if he can. } Bd7 {Black threatens the queen.} 22. Qd5 {Moves to capture the pawn.} Rf5 {Black threatens the Queen. I'm not sure why black didn't move Be6. I think perhaps black was working to double his rooks on the f file maybe.} 23. Qxd4 {Captures the pawn. I think white could have taken the rook (23. Qxf5 Bxf5 24. Nxd6 leads to a stronger position for white, I think)} Ba3 {Attempting to contain the queenside pawn advantage.} 24. Nf2 {Discovered attack on the queen. The e file action continues.} Qd8 {Brings the queen back to back rank for defense. } 25. Rxe8+ { ...and rightly so... capture.} Qxe8 {Forced.} 26. Re1 {Another threat on the queen.} Qc8 {Hovering around the back rank, also lining up along the diagonal if the opportunity presents itself.} 27. Qe3 {loading up the e file} Qf8 {loading up the f file and connecting the DSB} 28. Nd3 {bringing the knights into the mix offensively, preparing to attack the bishop with Nfe5.} Bd6 {Preparing for the same move Nfe5.} 29. Nfe5 {inevitable.} Bc8 {Moves the bishop to safety.} 30. Nc4 {Now, the black DSB is lost. } Bb7 {Pressures the g2 square, hoping for a long shot blunder.} 31. Nxd6 {Capture.} cxd6 {Capture. Another indefensible pawn.} 32. h4 {Making room for the king to move and adding a future attacker to the king side.} h6 {Similar thoughts on the defense.} 33. Qe8 {Time to exchange the queens.} Rf1+ {Counter check} 34. Kh2 {White's earlier pawn move was timed well.} Qxe8 {Capture, although Kg8 may have left black in better position. (34. ..Kg8 35. Qxf8+ Rxf8)} 35. Rxe8+ {Capture} Kh7 {Forced} 36. Re1 {White offers another exchange. I think Re7 would have allowed white to continue to collect additional material with a strong pawn advantage on the queen side. } Rf7 {Black retreats.} 37. Re6 {White returns to his pawn sweep.} Rd7 {Black attempts to defend the pawn.} 38. c4 {White begins his queen side pawn advance, at which point black resigns.}
