1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. d4 {first of this is not a blunder it's actually a variation of the king's gambit!} g5 {i don't know about this move the chess opening database on gameknot (which i use regurarly) doesn't say what move black should play after 3.d4 but i think my opponent's move wasn't the best i would have played 3 .. Qh4+ instead because i would be forced to move my king!} 4. Bc4 Qf6 5. h3 d6 6. Nc3 Nc6 7. Nd5 Qd8 8. Nf3 Bg7 9. Nxg5 {this move pretty much describes my chess style and preferences to a tea! i mean this move completely weakens my position you will see that as the game unfolds this turns out to be a mistake not necessary a blunder because even though black clearly got an advantage out of this he still has to work very had to win! fortunately for me my opponent wasn't up to the task!!} Qxg5 {good move!!} 10. Nxc7+ Kd8 11. Nxa8 Qxg2 12. Rf1 Bxh3 13. Qf3 Nxd4 {I am thinking about resigning at this moment but the game is too alive for me to resign even though I am losing bad!!} 14. Qxg2 Bxg2 15. Rf2 Bxe4 {surely now i must resign but wait black might have a superior material advantage but his king and back rack looks weak at least according to my assessment let me force my opponent to earn the win!!} 16. Rxf4 {blunder!! I was so convinced my position was lost that i missed a very good defensive move bishop to b3!! damn!! i can't blame myself though this was one hell of a crazy blitz game!!} Nxc2+ 17. Kd1 Bg6 18. Bxf7 Nxa1 19. Bxg6 hxg6 20. Rf7 {i had my mouse on the resign button after this move  i mean white is toast after black plays rook to h1!! } Bd4 {wtf!! what in the world is black thinking!! maybe hes not even thinking but just pushing pieces because what else can explain this move?} 21. Bg5+ {now i am just simply continuing to play to force my opponent to earn the win!! remember this is a blitz game so probably i can force my opponent into time trouble!! i mean thats my only hope of winning anywhere unless he blunders!!} Kc8 22. Nc7 Rh1+ {hey!! he finally played the move but its not as potent as it would have been three moves ago!!} 23. Ke2 Nc2 24. Nb5 Rh5 25. Nxd6+ {well well well!! what do you know!! this game is far from over!! } Kb8 26. Bf4 Be5 27. Bxe5 Rxe5+ 28. Kd3 Ne1+ 29. Kd2 Nh6 30. Rxb7+ Ka8 31. Rh7 Nf3+ 32. Kc3 Nf5 {this game was a gift from my opponent!! if they is one thing I learned from this game is that i should never resign a blitz game, i should force my opponent to earn the win!!} 33. Rh8+ {}
