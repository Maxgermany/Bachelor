1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. c4 {Advised players won't try to defend the pawn.} e6 {Icelandic. } 4. Nc3 {Ok, not helping black's developement. } exd5 {A new try. Some annoyance can spread now from Qe2+, but nothing unhandable. } 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nf3 {The isolated d pawn is not easy to handle. } Nf4 {?? Qa4+ and I'll lose the N! The idea was to avoid Qe2 after Qd7+, disturbing the developement of white's lsb and considering Nd3+ (BxN it's a clean B pair for black). } 7. d4 {? Sparing me from the fatal loss. } Bd6 8. Bxf4 Bxf4 {Now, of course, Qe2+ becomes possible, and white can develop his lsb. } 9. g3 Qe7+ 10. Qe2 Bd6 {It's astonishing how bad white's play allows me to play confortably without any of the Qside pieces developed. } 11. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {Well, white is slighly better now.} 12. Nd5 {o-o-o was advisable instead, or Bg2. } Bd6 {It's weird all this B manouvering, but I have another B...} 13. Bd3 {? Probably trying to castle Kside, but still Bg2 was needed. } Bg4 {Bh3 was probably better, threatening Bg2 (by black)} 14. Ng5 {If your opponent goes after a poisoned pawn... let him and use the tempo. } h6 {? Probably Nc6 was much better. The no-queens - no-castling is a less seen asset. } 15. Nh7 {If g6? Nf6+ of course. But...} Bf3 {Too easy...} 16. Ndf6+ {A clean piece is mine, but this move has its purpose. } gxf6 17. Nxf6+ {Where to go? After a double threat, of course. } Ke7 18. Be4 {This was the point- but not enough to save the game. } Bxh1 {? Better was Bb4+ at once. } 19. Nd5+ Kd7 20. Nf6+ Ke6 {No queens, no open lines, no white's dsb... I can play moves like this. } 21. Bxh1 Bb4+ {Grabbing the edge.} 22. Kd1 c6 {I can let white take b7. I'll lose an exchange, but I will be able to use the tempo.} 23. Ne4 Rd8 {I'm sorry for my Qside pieces, but this is the forcing move } 24. a3 Rxd4+ {In a patzer's game like this, I can still fall for tricks. Let's see some of them. } 25. Kc2 {I can play Rc4+ and after Kb3 I'll lose a piece. } Ba5 26. Nc5+ {Ouch, by to b7. Still winning. } Kf6 {[%clk 0:02:51] } 27. Nxb7 Bb6 {Now... where will you go, nighty knight?} 28. Re1 Rd7 29. Re8 {Interesting, white builds a trick I didn't see. Can you, dear beginner?} Rxb7 {[%clk 0:02:38] } 30. Bxc6 {Well done, white. Still...} Nxc6 31. Rxa8 Rb8 {Nb8 was even funnier. } 32. Rxb8 Nxb8 {Well... :-)} 33. f3 Bg1 34. h3 Nc6 35. Kd3 Ne5+ 36. Ke4 Nc4 37. b4 Nxa3 38. h4 a6 {This was to avoid any escape for the b pawn. } 39. h5 Nc2 40. g4 Nxb4 41. f4 a5 42. g5+ hxg5 43. fxg5+ Kxg5 44. Ke5 Kxh5 45. Kf6 a4 46. Kg7 {Hoping in a stalemate.} a3 47. Kh7 {Can I finish him without the Q?} Bd4 48. Kg8 Kg6 49. Kf8 Bf6 50. Kg8 Nd5 51. Kf8 Nc7 52. Kg8 {Ne6 = stalemate...} a2 53. Kf8 a1=Q 54. Kg8 Qa8# {Not elegant, of course...}
