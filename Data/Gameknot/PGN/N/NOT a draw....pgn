1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. O-O Bf5 7. d4 e6 8. h3 h5 {Blunder. It is not necessary, and black can't lose a single tempo for developing.} 9. Bd3 Bxd3 {Another idea could have been Bh7, and if white echanges, my rook has to look for its fate somewhere, and it won't have been easy. } 10. Qxd3 Nf6 11. Re1 Nbd7 12. d5 {The wise one would have been cxd, and castle kingside soon after, but...} O-O-O 13. dxc6 Qxc6 {The "surprise" I had in mind, remembering of a "zen" game I held recently. } 14. Qe2 Bb4 15. Bd2 Kb8 16. a3 Bxc3 {Maybe not the wise choice, as the dsb is a most important piece for me. } 17. Bxc3 Nd5 18. Ne5 {Ough! I have to take it because I cannot affor Nxf7. } Nxe5 19. Qxe5+ {...but anyway, a pawn is lost. } Qc7 {I save a tempo to protect f7 after Qxg7} 20. Qxg7 Nxc3 {I must, or Be5.} 21. Qxc3 {Now, I had the idea that his pawns would have been very vulnerable.} Qxc3 22. bxc3 Rd2 23. Kf1 Rc8 24. Re2 Rd5 {RxR, KxR, Rxc3, but I was sure I could do it later. } 25. Re3 Rdc5 26. Ke1 Rc5xc3 27. Rxc3 Rxc3 28. Kd2 {I can't see the benefit... well.. material is even.} Rc4 29. Rb1 Kc7 30. Rb3 Rf4 31. f3 b6 32. Rc3+ {Not on the 3rd row, because the rook's penetration would have been lethal...} Kd7 33. Ke3 Ra4 34. g4 h4 35. Kd3 Rf4 36. Ke3 e5 37. Rd3+ Ke7 38. Rc3 Kd7 39. Rd3+ Kc7 {I thought it was draw. } 40. Rc3+ Kd7 {He rejected a draw offer. } 41. Rb3 Rc4 42. Kd3 Rd4+ 43. Ke3 {I could have played for draw, now, but I wanted to see what happened if My rook penetrates... except it was the wrong timing. } Rd1 44. Rd3+ Rxd3+ 45. Kxd3 Kd6 46. Ke4 Ke6 47. f4 f6 48. fxe5 fxe5 49. c4 Kd6 50. Kf5 Kc5 {My last hope. If he goes for promotion, I have a slight chance...} 51. g5 Kd4 52. g6 e4 53. g7 e3 54. g8=Q e2 55. Qd5+ Ke3 56. Qe4+ Kd2 57. Qd4+ Kc1 58. Qxh4 Kd2 59. Qf4+ {Well, the story is well known. White wins. }
