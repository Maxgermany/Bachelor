[Opening "Sicilian (B32), Labourdonnais-Loewenthal variation"]

1. e4 {Perhaps nozar is a dedicated e4 player. I shouldn't be too concerned either way.} c5 {I've cut my teeth defending through the Sicilian. A powerful counter which may be unwieldy at times. Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate here. This should be a treat for both of us.} 2. Nf3 {Well at least he's not a Grand Prix Attack player.} Nc6 {Nc6 instead of d6 because I mean business today.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 {I aim my Kalashnikov...} 5. Nf3 {... and am left somewhat disappointed that White backs down} Nf6 {At least the tempo is good for development} 6. Nc3 Bb4 {Why not be bold? It's just a blitz.} 7. Bg5 {White has joined the dance.} O-O 8. Bxf6 {Bxf6?! Once again nozar allows me to damage his pawn structure. I wonder if he understands the implications of doing so?} Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 Qxf6 10. Qd5 a6 11. Rd1 {I guess opening files on the Queenside meant that much to him. Not a bad position because I cannot immediately coordinate a Kingside response. I will need to turn his doubled pawns into a liability.} Rd8 12. Bc4 d6 13. O-O Be6 {I'm pretty much running on autopilot here.} 14. Qd3 Bxc4 15. Qxc4 Rac8 {I still have not worked out the kinks of this "plan." Somehow, I am going to isolate files a,b & c from the rest of the game and then force a pawn through. I'm thinking geometrically in hemispheres (for want of a better word) rather than moves at this point. My biggest risk is that the whole game crumbles and I suffer a back-rank mate but I suspect I'm safe here.} 16. Qd3 Na5 {c4 looked like a cozy outpost at the time and it didn't matter to me which piece was there as long as it was mine.} 17. Rdb1 {An a4 push could cause problems later. I didn't care.} b5 {He saw this coming. } 18. Rfd1 {Was I giving him too much credit? When was a4 going to happen?} Nc4 19. Nd2 {An alternative to the pawn thrust.} Qe6 20. Nxc4 Rxc4 {I've plugged the hole and slowed down a4.} 21. Rb3 Qc8 22. Qf3 Ra4 23. a3 Qc5 24. Rd5 Qc4 {On second thought this was a mistake. 24. Rd5? Rxa3! 25. Rxa3 Qxa3 {25. Rxc5?? Ra1+ 26. Rb1 Rxb1+ 27. Qd1 Rxd1#} was much better for me. } 25. Qd3 {I think he wanted to simplify at this point. } Qxe4 {I am happy to oblige (now that I have an advantage)} 26. Qxe4 Rxe4 27. f3 Re2 28. Rb2 Kf8 {I have deja vu of our previous game at this point.} 29. Kf1 Re3 30. Rb3 f5 {f5! This move keeps my e-Rook alive} 31. Kf2 f4 32. g3 g5 33. Rd3 Rxd3 34. cxd3 {Pawns undoubled. I still feel confident with both material and space.} Ke7 35. h4 {h4? This takes the King out of the middle of the board} fxg3+ 36. Kxg3 gxh4+ 37. Kxh4 {Now White will be momentarily preoccupied with staving off an h-pawn advance} Rf8 38. Kg3 Ke6 39. Rb4 {Crap! I'm down to 50 seconds and have not calculated this endgame. } Rc8 {Folks, please do as I say and not as I do. Always calculate your endgames.} 40. c4 bxc4 41. Rxc4 {Nozar actually meant to capture with the pawn instead.} Rxc4 42. dxc4 d5 {It's all downhill from here for White} 43. cxd5+ Kxd5 44. Kg4 Ke6 45. a4 a5 46. Kg5 Kd5 47. Kh6 Ke6 48. Kxh7 Kf5 49. Kg7 Kf4 50. Kf6 {I actually remember a beginner's endgame study almost identical to this position. Never thought I'd really see one of those in live gameplay.} e4 51. fxe4 {The solution is trivial} Kxe4 52. Ke6 Kd4 53. Kd6 Kc4 54. Kc6 Kb4 55. Kb6 Kxa4 56. Kc5 Kb3 57. Kb5 a4 {It's a shame that blitzes are unrated games.} 58. Ka5 a3 {Resignation}
