1. e4 {Being A Bully  I like this one, even though its against a lower rated opponent, especially since he got his revenge in the return!} e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Qe2+ Ne7 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bf4 {A bit of an unusual opening, but now getting into my stride.} h6 7. Nf3 f6 8. O-O-O b6 {Little or no development from black, he needed to do more with the centre.} 9. Qd3 Bb7 10. g3 g5 11. Be3 g4 12. Nh4 Rg8 13. Bg2 {I'm already aware of the weakness at g6, just trying to work things around so I can do summat with it.} Nd7 {Now comes black's development but this move does him no favours, blocking off the escape route for the king.} 14. Rde1 Bc6 {Again a fairly negative move.} 15. a4 Bb7 16. Bf4 Rg7 {And thats the move which starts the casacde!} 17. Bxh6 Rf7 18. Bxf8 Rxf8 19. Bxd5 c6 20. Qg6+ {And yes I know its a bit brutal, but he gets his revenge trust me!}
