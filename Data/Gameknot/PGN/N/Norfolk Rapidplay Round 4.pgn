1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. d4 {Two knights game, love this opening!} exd4 5. e5 Ne4 6. O-O Be7 7. Bd5 Nc5 8. Bxc6 dxc6 9. Nxd4 {Fairly level position} O-O 10. Nc3 a6 {bizarre move, beats me} 11. Re1 Ne6 12. Be3 {Don't like Nxe6} c5 13. Nxe6 {Hoping he doesn't play Qxd1 leading to a draw-ish endgame. Nf5 maybe?} Bxe6 14. Qf3 {phew! Think this is advantage white} c6 {best way to protect b7} 15. Qg3 {threatening Bh6} Kh8 16. Rad1 Qe8 {Weak move. Expected Qb6, b3 preparing Na4} 17. Ne4 {Attacking the weak doubled pawn, Na4 is also playable.} b6 {the best method of defending it} 18. Nd6 Qb8 {Bxd6 is better.} 19. c4 {Wanted to play Qf3, Qh5 but Bd5 stops Qf3, hence this move.} Qc7 20. Rd3 {Doubling rooks} f5 {A weak move I think. But black has to do something} 21. exf6 e.p. Bxf6 {the only response that doesn't lose.} 22. Bf4 {threating the bishop and various discovered threats} Bg8 {Probably blacks best option} 23. Ne4 {I think this is the best knight move.} Qf7 24. Nxf6 {Best move I think} gxf6 {I think Qxf6 falls to Be5, Rd6 etc} 25. Red1 {Preparing Rd7} Rae8 26. h3 {Rd7, Qxd7.  Bh6 is also playable but I think I have better than the exchange with this attack.} Qxc4 27. Rd3d7 {Threatening mate} Rf7 {Preventing the mate} 28. Bh6 {threatening another mate!} Re1+ 29. Kh2 {Rxe1, Rxd7 and black is fine.} Ree7 {the only way to stop the mate methinks} 30. Qxg8+ {A beutiful sacrifice! #in4!} Kxg8 31. Rd7d8+ Re8 32. Rxe8+ Rf8 33. Rxf8# {Very satisfying game to play!}
