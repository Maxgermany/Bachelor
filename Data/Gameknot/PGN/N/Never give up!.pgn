1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nc3 e6 {Here, white should play Bb5+. Black has a hard time defending properly (if ever possible). } 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {It is not wise to play the Icelandic gambit against a player more than 150 points over you, but this is what blitz is for, isn't it?} 5. Bb5+ {Now it is inoffensive. } c6 6. Ba4 Bc5 {Just developing, and a bit too late for the true Icelandic scheme, that foresees Qe7 before the bishop is out. But I feel very unsure about it yet. } 7. Qe2 {...but it has a good reason to be: white can reverse the threat. } Qe7 8. Bb3 {I can end with an isolani in e, but after exchanging a lot of material. This would be fine to me. } Ng4 {But leave me, and I'll attack. } 9. Nh3 {Good sign. } Nd7 {Not hurrying. I'm happy with white's developement, now. } 10. d3 {Of course, now white's dsb can counter mine. A well-known ball on the black diagonals...} O-O-O {!? This was the risky move. I wanted to keep mobility, and I bet to myself I will be able to control white's influence on the black squares. } 11. Ne4 Bb6 12. Nd6+ {White sacs the knight... does it work?} Qxd6 13. Bf4 Qd4 {? A good answer would have been: Ng-e5. White can recover the piece, eventually, provided he manages to play d4, but his attack will be controlled. It was too complex for a blitz, so I tried this one.} 14. Bxe6 {My knight is under attack. I thought in Nxf2, or Bxf2+, but I didn't find anything better than to lose the piece. I looked for something able to justify my weak move...} Qxb2 {Well, hardly convincing. } 15. Bxd7+ {Here, if I go RxB, I couldn't anymore threatened to occupy the e column. } Kxd7 {Is this better? No, because white takes the knight with check, and black is plainly lost! That's all. } 16. O-O {But no! White played "safely" and spared me my knight!} f5 {Of course and without thinking. } 17. Rfb1 {Here again I wanted to surprise my opponent, but I blundered again. } Rhe8 {...because white takes with check. So simple to see. } 18. Qxe8+ Rxe8 19. Rxb2 {A rook under. Just a badly placed knight... I should resign, right?} Re2 20. Rxb6 {First aid. -3. But I would have caused problems on f2. } axb6 21. f3 Nf6 {Not exchanging pieces without purpose. } 22. Rc1 h6 {Avoiding knight's mobility. Black can escape through f2, but I have no way to block the knight by threatening the black bishop, even if it seems tempting. It can find g3, and I wont' exchange it for my only last minor piece. } 23. Kf1 Re8 24. Re1 Ra8 {White can press me with something, but there nothing clear in one tempo...} 25. Ra1 {So he defends. } Nd5 {Now I try the knight's adventure. Being the rook confined to a1, I can move more freely. } 26. c4 Nb4 {It seems that I will exchange rooks for a pawn... not really a bargain. } 27. Be5 {Interesting. I want to take the d6 pawn (and I don't fear Rd1), but I don't want to lose my nice chain for nothing. } g5 {Bg7 and I'll have to force g4 and see what happens. } 28. a3 {Thank you white!} Nxd3 29. Rd1 Rxa3 30. Ke2 Ke6 {...and now, if white goes Bg7, I'll take some revenge on his pawns, and there is still game to go. } 31. Rxd3 Rxd3 32. Kxd3 Kxe5 {I'm still a piece under, but I have two pawns. Will they be enough to drawn?} 33. Nf2 c5 34. g3 h5 35. Nd1 {Here, if my calculations are right, I will get a free pawn somewhere, or a king's passport to f4 and to the white pawns. } f4 36. Nc3 fxg3 37. hxg3 h4 {Thanks to white's play, I've got my free pawn, and this will be important. I'm a threat again. } 38. gxh4 gxh4 39. Ne2 h3 40. Ke3 h2 41. f4+ Kf6 {Ok, white still wins. I have to think about my other pawns. They are my last hope. } 42. Ng3 b5 43. cxb5 b6 44. Ke4 Kf7 {I'm attracting the white king out of my pawn's "square", and he can't use the knight to block it since it is slave of the h pawn. I felt a little relieved after my blunders...} 45. Kd5 Kf6 {Here again, white can't simply go Kc6, because of c4...} 46. f5 {So he tried to take tempoes...} Kg5 {...and my new focus is now to let him queen but with the h2 pawn - that is my draw insurance for a while. } 47. Ke6 Kg4 48. Nh1 Kh3 {Another choice is c4. Someone wiser than me would tell if this was better. } 49. f6 Kg2 50. f7 Kxh1 51. f8=Q Kg2 52. Qg7+ {White has no choice but exchanging the queens, and then I'll win. His only hope it to take with check the b pawn, but... look at his king: it seems impossible! } Kf1 53. Qf6+ Kg2 54. Qg5+ Kf1 55. Qf4+ Kg2 56. Qg4+ Kf1 57. Qh3+ Kg1 58. Qe3+ Kg2 59. Kd6 {As you see, white has just draw or risk. } h1=Q 60. Qe4+ Kg1 61. Qxh1+ {Of course, white is throwing away the game. Black queens first. } Kxh1 62. Kc6 c4 63. Kxb6 c3 64. Ka7 c2 65. b6 c1=Q {...and THE WHITE PAWN IS IN THE B COLUMN, and not in the "safe ones", a, c, f, h. The slighest of the differences for an undeserved but still funny game. I hope not to have overlook too many things, and that there is some "food for thoughts" somewhere in it. }
