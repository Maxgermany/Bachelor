1. e4 c5 2. d4 {The Smith-Morra gambit.  Usual continuation is 2...cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3, where white sacrifices a pawn for fast development.} cxd4 3. Qxd4 {Bringing the queen out this early is dubious.} Nc6 4. Qd1 {Now black is ahead in development, and the space in front of white's king is open.} Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 Bb4 7. Bb5 O-O {I could have won a pawn with Nxe4.} 8. O-O d5 {I still could have won a pawn with Bxc3.} 9. e5 Ne4 10. a3 {Loses at least a pawn.} Bxc3 11. Qd3 {? He should have recaptured.} Ba5 12. b4 Bb6 13. Be3 Bxe3 14. Qxe3 f6 15. Bd3 fxe5 16. Bxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 Qd5 18. Qh4 {White wisely declines the exchange.} e4 {The white knight was defending two potential threats against c2: Nd4 and Qd2.} 19. Ng5 {Nice multiple attack: e6 is well defended, but not e4 or h7.} h6 {In my initial analysis I thought e4 was safe: 20. Nxe4 g5 21. Qg4 e5 and I saw no way for the queen to protect the knight.} 20. Nxe4 g5 21. Qg4 e5 22. Qe2 {I missed this move.} Nd4 23. Qd3 Bf5 24. Rfe1 Rac8 25. Rad1 {I thought this left the c2 pawn underdefended, but missed the discovered pin.} Rxc2 26. Qxc2 Nxc2 27. Rxd5 Nxe1 28. Nd6 {The dust settles and I did gain a pawn. He decides to make multiple threats rather than get a pawn immediately with Rxe5.} Nc2 {Certainly not 28...Rd8? 29. Nxf5 Rxd5 30. Ne7 ! This avoids a fork after Rxe5, as well as attacking a3.} 29. h3 Nxa3 30. Rxe5 Bc8 {As it turns out, this is a poor move.} 31. Re3 Rd8 {? I missed the combination 32. Nxc8 Rxc8 33. Rxa3 31...Nc2 Rc3 32. Nxb4 Nxc8 at least would have gained a pawn. 31...Nb1 also doesn't work well, after 32. Rb3 Nd2 33. Rd3 Nf3  (Nb1 34. Rb3 repeats the position) 34. gxf3 Bxh3 35. Nxb7} 32. Nxc8 Rxc8 33. Rxa3 a6 34. Rd3 Rc1+ 35. Kh2 Kf8 {Preventing 36. Rd8  Kf7 37. Rd7  followed by Rxb7, but b5 would have done this as well.} 36. Rd7 Rc2 {The only other option I could see was 36...b5 37. Rd6 Rc4 38. Rxa6 Rxb4 39. Rxh6} 37. f3 b5 {Well, that's the only option I see now.} 38. Rh7 {Better would be Rd6, forking two pawns and preventing my next move.  This move does keep my king on the back rank though.} Rc6 39. Kg3 Kg8 {What else is there?} 40. Ra7 Kf8 41. Kg4 {h4 is another possibility.} Rc4+ {Setting up a race.  Better would be Rf6, protecting both pawns.} 42. Kh5 Rxb4 43. g4 {Blocking the rook in preparation of h4?  I would have gone for one of the pawns.} Ra4 {Protecting the a pawn and unblocking the b pawn.  Better would have been Rb3 or Rf4, leading to 44. Kxh6 Rxf3 45. Rxa6 Rxh3  46. Kxg5, with a more even game.} 44. Kxh6 b4 {My pawn has a head start, but will the rook slow it down enough?  (As it turns out, I had to spend my time on the queenside rather than advancing my pawns.)} 45. Rb7 {He can't let my rook get behind the pawn.} a5 {Protecting the pawn so the rook can move.} 46. Kxg5 Ra3 {Wins a pawn.} 47. h4 {He wants to keep the one farthest from my king, I assume.} Rxf3 48. h5 Rf7 {If we exchange rooks, my pawns will win.} 49. Rb8+ Kg7 50. h6+ Kh7 51. Kh5 {Stepping out of the way of the g pawn.} Ra7 {Ha! I still had hopes of advancing my pawns.} 52. g5 Ra6 {Preventing g6.} 53. Rb7+ Kh8 {Not 53...Kg8 54. h7 } 54. g6 Ra8 {Preventing Rb8#.} 55. h7 {At this point I knew I had lost unless my opponent messed up.} Rc8 {I resigned.  One possible conclusion is 56. Kh6 Rg8 57. hxg8=Q  Kxg8 58. Rb8#}
