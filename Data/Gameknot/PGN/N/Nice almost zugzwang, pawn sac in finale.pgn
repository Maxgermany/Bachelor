1. d4 {Probably not a spectacular game, but the middle game is an example of positions in which you have to apply "deep strategic decisions". The situations in which you have three o four moves to choose and you don't have a clue about what do they lead... terrifying, even if everything seem to be plain and calm. The endgame, an example of how sacrifying two pawns can lead to a victory on an almost stalled, almost but not zugzwang...} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 g6 4. h3 Bg7 5. c3 O-O {A classic example of my favorite system against a fianchetto. Hard to break, the black scheme up to here is one of the more solid against my opening. } 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Nbd2 c5 8. Be2 {Normally, Bd3, but there it is pointing at the rocky enemy pawns. In this position, a remote possibility to break in h5 still exists. } cxd4 9. exd4 Re8 10. Ne5 {A way to prevent e5 from black in the near future. } e6 {This is a typical position of my white play. I must admit that it looks better for white if the BSB is not fianchettoed. } 11. g4 {This is "my" attack. I assume I will castle queenside, and bring my rooks behind a pawns' storm. } Nb6 12. g5 {"Developing" my queen would have been a mistake. It is ok where it is, taking advange of the d1-h5 diagonal. } Nfd7 13. h4 {Nd2-f3 was also possible. I was taking care of his Nc4...} Nxe5 14. dxe5 {The idea is to difficult f6 as a liberatory maneuver. After d4, Nf3 should be ok. } Qc7 {Now, I lost the attention to c4 by defending e6. I should have seen that. } 15. Nf3 Nc4 {If Qd4, defending the pawn, Nxb3 with no compensation, since the knight can return to c4. Or maybe yes, by playing Rb1, Rb4... anyway. My dream of h5 vanishes. } 16. Bxc4 Qxc4 17. Qd2 {Not that terrible. If Qe4+, Qe3 and all black has is to ruin my pawns... but not in the worst way. } Bd7 {The idea of Bb5 looks ok for black. I could have prevented it by a4, but I wanted to get rid of the annoying check in e4. } 18. Nd4 Rac8 {Now, b3 becomes impossible. I think it's the right moment to stop thinking in attacking and try to loosen pressure with a queen's exchange. } 19. Qe2 Qxe2+ 20. Kxe2 Rc4 21. h5 {Just to bark a little.} Rec8 {What for? c3 is solid.} 22. hxg6 {h6 traps his bishop, but it is already making his job, so there is no point in it. } fxg6 {A mistake, since e6 stays unsupported by f7. And I had no real possibility to make any damage on the h column.} 23. Rh4 {In order to free my knight. I am not sure about this move, tough. } Ra4 {What is doing this rook, there? Just preventing my Ra-h1? } 24. a3 {Yes, I let him the white squares...} Rf8 25. Bg3 Rf7 26. b3 {This is the point to which I was referring.   f2-f4 seems to be a logic move. I will be able to move either the rook or the bishop, ok, but not both of them. I would need to use the king to defend so I can move them both, but... is all this a valid defensive plan? I don't know, but it was DEFENSIVE...  Rf4 can be a way to avoid the rook pressure on the column f. I must be sure about what happens if Bxe5, RxR, KxR, BxB... ok to me, but he won't play it. And if HE plays RxR, BxR we have a close to stalled situation (my impression, but...).  Let's start to be creative. What about Nxe6? RxR, NxB (!), Re4+ (!) doesn't work.  Other strange moves as f3 can be interesting, maybe.  But the only workable aggressive plan seemed to be acting against the rook with my pawns. This can be seen as conquering space, and to the other side, as a way to expose them to the black bishops AND rook.   Can you imagine how many variants did I tried? The result simply was not clear.  So I played it!  } Ra5 27. a4 Rc5 28. Kd3 Ra5 {What for? Just to avoid b4. But his rook is in an uneasy position. And his bishop will end dominating empty white squares... and he will lose the very important e6!!! I won't think it twice!} 29. b4 Rxa4 30. Rxa4 Bxa4 31. Nxe6 Rf5 32. Nxg7 Kxg7 {Maybe Kd4 is better. Or Rd4 before f4. I don't know. But the real winning move here is another. I didn't play it. } 33. f4 {Now, I have the advantage of a free pawn in the center. Could I win with it? Maybe, I had to be more fatithful to my style and play inmediately e6, and with this move I would have won. } Bc6 34. Kd4 {Note that with b6 my king cannot penetrate. Only with great difficulty I could have loosen his defence. But he played...} a6 {What? He doesn't play b6? My hopes are high again!} 35. Kc5 Rf8 36. Kd6 Rh8 {So he is trying to counterattack on the h column... because he sees that my King will be the active attacking piece. } 37. Bf2 {I calculated that my bishop will come on time to prevent his attack on the h column. } Ra8 38. Bb6 Rf8 39. e6 Re8 40. e7 Kg8 {The open h column is my winning card, here. Otherwise, the king could approach my pawn...} 41. Ke6 Kg7 42. Bd4+ Kg8 43. Kf6 Bd7 44. Bc5 Bc6 {He is planning a stonewall, and just moving pieces around until drawn is declared. He suggested it at some point. I refused it.  My plan was to trap his rook with Bd8. It would have been zugswang for him. But I couldn't find a way to get out his rook from a, b and c8...  I started to see that I would have to think about sacrifices in order to win. I thought seriously Rxg6, losing a rook for 2 pawns in order to advance my own pawn storm.  I COULDN't lose a position like this one!} 45. f5 gxf5 46. g6 hxg6 47. Bd4 {The difference, now, is that my rook can mate in h8. He can hardly escape. } Rc8 48. Ke6 {}
