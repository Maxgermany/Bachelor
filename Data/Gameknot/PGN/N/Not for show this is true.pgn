[Opening "Budapest (A52), Adler variation"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 {The Budapest is not recommendable, but I like it because it forces both of us to think.} 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bg5 {This is the more aggressive play by white. I have many choices, and I tried to find something more than Be7.} Bb4+ 6. Nc3 f6 {The plan I want to test. Risk is my open K, but white will be behind in developement. } 7. exf6 gxf6 {Now I expected Bh4, and I have to think hard how to make progress, being Qd5 on white's agenda.} 8. Bd2 {Unpinning, but not solving his developement problem. } Qe7 {Why not? Nd5, BxB+, and I have to be careful about Nxc7+, but I have some resources too.} 9. h3 {This is a not very easy to see mistake. White urges developement, he needs e6, even at the cost of closing himself in. This just makes things very easy for me. Be aware...} Nge5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 {Last chance for white to play e3. Very last chance...} 11. Nd5 {Oh, I can't believe it...} Nd3# {A dream smothered mate, as you see it only in theory books!!! :-) :-) }
