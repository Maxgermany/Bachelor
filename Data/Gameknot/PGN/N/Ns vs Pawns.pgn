1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Qh4+ 4. Kf1 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qf6 6. Nc3 Bd6 {So far, known book moves. But here, ...Bd6? gives White a valuable tempo.} 7. d4 Qh6 8. e5 Be7 9. Nd5 {Threatens the fork on c7 and the f pawn. } Bd8 10. Bxf4 Qg6 11. Bd3 Qh5 12. h3 f6 {...f6?? Another, more serious error. } 13. exf6 {Of course, since the N can't be taken due to fxg!} Nxf6 14. Nxc7+ Bxc7 15. Bxc7 O-O 16. Kg1 {White wants to unpin the N and prevent a piece moving to g4.} Ne8 17. Bh2 {? A slight inaccuracy, blocking the K} d5 18. Be2 Qg6 19. Bd3 Qf6 20. c3 Bxh3 {A nice move, exploiting the move Bh2. } 21. Be2 Bg4 22. Bg3 Nd6 23. Ne5 Bxe2 24. Qxe2 Ne4 {A strong move.} 25. Qh5 {White decides an active attack is better than passive defense. } h6 {Prevents the mate.} 26. Nd7 {!? White decides to go for an interesting ending. } Qf7 27. Nxf8 Qxh5 28. Rxh5 Nxg3 29. Rxd5 {Now } Rxf8 {Now the game is technically even material wise, 2 Ns for R+P, but White plans on exploiting the more active rook position and less coordinated Ns to gain an advantage.} 30. Rd7 Nd8 31. Re1 Nh5 32. Ree7 {With 2 rooks on the 7th Rank, White now has an advantage since the Ns are not as effective against advanced pawns.} g6 33. Rdc7 g5 34. d5 {White begins the advance. } Nf6 35. d6 Nc6 {Black's defensive approach has not worked. } 36. Reg7+ Kh8 37. Rcxb7 Nd8 38. Rbxa7 Ne6 {Black is desperate now.} 39. Rge7 Nd8 40. Ra8 {This pin is now fatal. Whites 4 pawns are more than a match for the N.} Kg8 41. c4 h5 42. c5 Nd5 {Seeking activity.} 43. Rd7 {Technically the R was immune since ...NxR PxN forked the N and R. But White is looking to trade off the remaining R.} Nc6 44. Rxf8+ Kxf8 45. a3 {Starting a pawn steamroller.} Nf6 46. Rc7 Nd8 {Trying to block the pawn, but...} 47. Rc8 {This pin proves fatal.} Ke8 48. c6 {And Black resigns, since White will win the N and still queen later.}
