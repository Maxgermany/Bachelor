[Opening "Vienna game, Max Lange defence (C25)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {I decided to try the Vienna Game.} Nc6 {The Max Lange variation.  The Falkbeer variation, Nf6, is more common, but both are solid.} 3. Bc4 {Other good moves are f4 and g3, as well as Nf3, transposing to the Three Knights Opening.} Nd4 {This move surprised me, probably developing another piece would be better.  It does threaten a fork at c2, so my queen can't move.} 4. Nf3 {Since he undefended e5, this is the natural response.  If Nxf3, Qxf3 threatens scholar's mate and gives me the edge in development.} Nf6 5. Nxe5 {In addition to gaining the pawn, this threatens Nxf7.} Bd6 {? d5 or Ne6 would have stopped the fork.} 6. Nxf7 {Winning the rook.} Qe7 7. Nxh8 Nxe4 {Threatening to win the queen with Nxc3 .} 8. Ne2 {If Nxe2 Qxe2, his attack has lost it's bite.} Be5 {Preparing Qd6 for an attack on h2?  Probably actually preparing what happened in the game.} 9. Nf7 {I wanted to get my king out with O-O, but that would lead to 9...Bxh2  10. Kxh2 (Kh1 Qh4 looks bad) Qh4  11. Kg1 Nf3  12. gxf3 Qg5  13. Ng3 (to avoid three-fold repetition, I failed to notice Kh2) Nxg3 14. fxg3 (I failed to notice Re1 ) Qxg3 , with three-fold repetition to follow. So I'll get my knight out of danger and threaten the bishop.} Qc5 {I figured he was attacking my bishop with thoughts of attack, but not an immediate plan.} 10. Nxe5 {? So I went ahead and took his bishop, expecting Qxe5. Nxd4 would have been the best move.} Nf3+ {! A very nice move, setting up the discovered threat of Qxf2#, which can't be prevented since the king is in check.} 11. Nxf3 {I decided to let him finish the checkmate.} Qxf2# {A very interesting ending position.  The loser is up by 11 points, we both have 6 pawns left on their starting squares, most of my back rank and half of his queenside haven't moved, and 14 of the 22 moves have been by knights.}
