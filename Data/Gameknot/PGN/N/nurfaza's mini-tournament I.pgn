[Opening "English (A35), symmetrical, four knights system"]

1. c4 {I like to play this opening } c5 {he must like the off-center games too} 2. Nc3 {the normal second move} Nc6 {ditto for him} 3. Nf3 {trying to prepare to eventually get my pawn to d4} Nf6 {he mimics me again} 4. g3 {I'll castle after I move the bishop to g2} e6 {he wants to get to d5 before I get to d4?} 5. d3 {I protect the c-pawn, expecting d5} d5 {and he plays it} 6. Bg2 {I want to get castled... the pawn trades can wait} g6 {he wants the other diagonal for his bishop} 7. O-O {safely tucked away now} Bg7 {now he's ready to castle} 8. Bg5 {I pin the knight, expecting him to castle anyway} Qd7 {the pin must have made him nervous} 9. a3 {I decide on a queen-side pawn attack} d4 {he nudges my knight} 10. Ne4 {I move to the "customary spot"} Nxe4 {he wants to trade (didn't think he would)} 11. dxe4 {now my pawns are double on the e-file and I've blocked my long diagonal} O-O {he finally castles} 12. Qd2 {I decide to remove the dark-squared bishops (when people do this to my king's bishop in this castling position, they usually end up with a good attack)} f6 {he tries to run off the bishop (and creates an escape hole for the king)} 13. Bh6 {I think I'm forcing the bishop trade} e5 {he ignores me!} 14. Nh4 {I try to lure the pawn up another square} Qf7 {he fortifies and attacks my "naked" c-pawn} 15. Bxg7 {I force the bishop trade anyway} Kxg7 {I expected him to take it with the queen} 16. f4 {I ignore the c-pawn weakness and attack the king-side pawns} b6 {I guess he wants to put the bishop on the a-h diagonal} 17. b4 {I switch fronts} Qxc4 {he takes the helpless pawn} 18. Qd3 {I offer a queen trade to undouble my pawns} Qf7 {he declines to help me out} 19. e3 {I'll trade it away} dxe3 {he sort of had to trade} 20. Qxe3 {he could gain another pawn here if he plays cxb, axb, Nxb} exf4 {he trades on the other side} 21. Rxf4 {bad move by me... now g5 could cost me a piece} Kh8 {did he see something I didn't?} 22. bxc5 {I keep from losing a pawn on this side, but I'm still risking a piece on the other flank} bxc5 {he retakes the pawn} 23. Qxc5 {I come out a pawn upo and hope the attack on his knight will keep him distracted} Ne5 {It works!.. now to get those pieces out of there!} 24. Raf1 {doubling rooks on his queen (hiding behind a pawn) should keep him from playing g5} Qg7 {he moves the queen out of fire} 25. Qd5 {I attack the unprotected rook} Bd7 {this move links his rooks and protects all his pieces} 26. Qd6 {I keep the pressure on the pawn} Bb5 {he attacks my rook} 27. Rb1 {I attack the attacker} a6 {he protects it} 28. Qb6 {he has ignored g5 for so long, I think I even forgot about it!} Nc4 {he forks my queen and pawn (both unprotected)} 29. Qe6 {I save the queen...} Nxa3 {and the pawn dies} 30. Rb3 {the rook was in danger} Nc2 {he's after a queen-rook fork on d4} 31. Qb6 {luckily, I notice it and move the queen} Rab8 {he goes after the queen again} 32. Qc5 {I move the queen and try to limit the knight's activities at the same time} Rbc8 {the rook continues to pursue} 33. Qd6 {I still need to protect again Nd4 (Nd4 followed by Ne2 would fork the King and rook)} Rcd8 {he continues pursuit} 34. Qc5 {I keep the queen near d4, but with the rook as backup, I can't stop the knight} Nd4 {he sees it alright (apparently, he still hasn't seen g5)} 35. Rb2 {I move the attacked rook and protect e2} Ne2+ {he goes there anyway (his bishop has his back!)} 36. Rxe2 {I lose a rook for a knight, but at least he won't fork me again} Bxe2 {he seals the trade} 37. Rf2 {I finally get one of my pieces out of the pawn fork threat} Bb5 {he puts the bishop back on the pawn} 38. Bf1 {I don't know why I did that!} Rd1 {just what I would have done!} 39. Kg2 {I get the king out so at least it will be a fair trade} Rc8 {??? surely he meant to go to d8, but I'm thankful for the gift} 40. Qxc8+ {I take it and check is a bonus!} Qg8 {he blocks with the queen (his only move really)} 41. Qc5 {I considered trading queens and picking off the f-pawn, but the passed a-pawn scared me} Bxf1+ {he's ready to trade the other pieces too} 42. Rxf1 {I really don't have a choice} Rxf1 {we trade bishops and now he wants to trade rooks too} 43. Kxf1 {I have to!} Qe8 {he picks on my isolated pawn} 44. Qc3 {I attack his weak pawn (I think I should have played Qc4, protecting mine and attacking his a-pawn)} Qb5+ {he checks me instead of taking the pawn!} 45. Ke1 {I need to get my king over to the a-file} Qb1+ {he checks me again, forking the pawn in the process} 46. Kd2 {I keep going toward the a-file} Qa2+ {he still prefers checks to taking the pawn!} 47. Qc2 {I'm close enough to the a-file to offer to trade queens now} Qa5+ {check again...} 48. Qc3 Qa2+ {and again...} 49. Qc2 Qa5+ 50. Kc1 Qe1+ 51. Kb2 Qb4+ 52. Ka2 Qa5+ 53. Kb3 Qb5+ 54. Kc3 Qc5+ 55. Kd3 Qa3+ {he's trying to get a perpetual check stalemate, so I work on a plan to hide behind the isolated pawn} 56. Kd4 Qb4+ 57. Ke3 Qb6+ 58. Ke2 Qb5+ 59. Qd3 Qb2+ 60. Qd2 Qb5+ 61. Kf3 Qb3+ 62. Kg2 {finally I move where he cannot put me in check} Qe6 {he wants the pawn now so he can continue checking me} 63. Qd5 {I protect it and attack the queen} Qe7 {he backs up but stays close} 64. Qa8+ {I check him and attack the a-pawn} Kg7 {his only move..} 65. Nf3 {I can't take his pawn without giving up mine} Qe6 {he protects the pawn} 66. Qd5 {I offer to trade queens again} Qe7 {he backs off again} 67. e5 {if he doesn't take it, I'll play Qd6 followed by e6, etc.} fxe5 {he takes the bait!} 68. Qxe5+ {now he's forced to trade queens!} Qxe5 {and has to do it} 69. Nxe5 {now I just need to get my knight to the a-file!} Kf6 {he's headed there too, no doubt!} 70. Nc4 {my knight may be a "short range" weapon, but it moves faster than a king} Ke6 {he's on my trail...} 71. Kf3 {I bring my king over too} Kd5 {he keeps coming} 72. Nb2 {I head for the corner} a5 {probably a mistake.. he should have tried to block my king with Kd4} 73. Kf4 {I decide the knight can handle it and head for the other two pawns} h6 {he prevents my king from coming closer to them} 74. g4 {I'll force the issue} Ke6 {he goes back to protect} 75. g5 {this is probably a bad move by me... I think h4 would have been better} h5 {he wants to keep the pawns} 76. h4 {I lock them up} Kd5 {he heads back for the a-file} 77. Na4 {I make sure his only move will be the King} Ke6 {he changes directions again (and that is a big mistake, Kd6 or Kd4 are better)} 78. Ke4 {now his King gave me an opening } Kd6 {his best bet} 79. Nc3 {my king is close enough to stop the a-pawn, so I'll send the knight to the other flank} Ke6 {I expected Kc5} 80. Nb5 {this will force the king back to the 7th rank} a4 {he moves the pawn instead!} 81. Nc7+ {I want the king to move away from the pawns before my kig goes after the a-pawn} Kd6 {he comes at the knight} 82. Nd5 {I go to the king for protection} a3 {he makes a run for it} 83. Nc3 {this will slow him down!} Ke6 {I think he's willing to give up the a-pawn to save the others} 84. Kf4 {just a stalling move} Kd6 {a bad move.....} 85. Nb5+ {he falls into a knight fork. The a-pawn is lost and, without the a-pawn to distract the knight, he resigns}
