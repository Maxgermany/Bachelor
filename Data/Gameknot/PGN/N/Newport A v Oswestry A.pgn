1. b3 {This was a loss against a slightly higher rated opponent.} e5 {This is Larsen's Opening https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen%27s_Opening} 2. Bb2 {He completes the fianchetto.} Nc6 {I protect the pawn.} 3. e3 {With a plan of playing Bf1-b5} d5 {I take the centre.} 4. Bb5 {Bishop comes out.} Bd6 {I protect the e pawn.} 5. c4 {He strikes the centre.} a6 {I hit his bishop.} 6. Bxc6+ {He takes.} bxc6 {I take back.} 7. c5 {He hits my bishop.} Bxc5 {I take.} 8. Bxe5 {He takes back.} Nf6 {In the previous games in this line f6 has been played instead of Nf6, but it seems to me to be the natural square to put the knight. Fritz prefers f6.} 9. Qc2 {And now I sank into deep thought. What to do about the attack on the bishop? I looked at Bd6 and 10. Qxc6+ Bd7, and white has his queen and bishop attacked, but white has got 11. Qc3 and the bishop is protected. I didn't like the look of Qe7 10. Bxc7. I didn't like the look of Nd7 11. Bxg7 Rg1 12. Qxh7. Afterwards Fritz give Nd7 as best and Bxg7 is met by Qg5!} Be7 {So I tried this pawn sac.} 10. Qxc6+ {He takes.} Bd7 {I block.} 11. Qxc7 {He takes again. I think this is a mistake, giving me plenty of compensation for the two pawns. I think it is better not to take. Fritz agrees with me. My opponent comments "Qxc7 was careless of me and I was lucky to escape the bind."} Qxc7 {I take.} 12. Bxc7 {He takes back.} Rc8 {I hit his bishop.} 13. Be5 {Bishop comes back.} Rc1+ {The rook takes up a dominating role.} 14. Ke2 {Forced!} Bb5+ {Patzer sees a check, patzer takes a check! I thought that this is the losing mistake! White is forced to play d3 (15. Kf3? Bd3 wins a piece). But d3 is a vital move in white's attempts to develop, and by forcing white to play it, it gives white an extra tempo. After the game we thought 14....0-0 and black has enough counter-play for equality. For instance 15. d3 Rf-c8 16. Nd2 Rxa1 17. Bxa1 Rc1 and white still has problems developing the king side. However Fritz does not agree with me, and does recommend this move! My opponent says "If Fritz thinks 14 ... Bb5+ is correct I think it shows the horizon effect - Fritz doesn't realise how difficult it is or even that it is not possible to get the rook on h1 into the game. The same applies to exchanging rooks on move 17." } 15. d3 {Forced, as explained previously. Again I had a long think. I was looking at Ne5 ad Ng5 - moves which Fritz thinks are best now. I considered variations like Ng4 16.	Bd4	Bxd3+ 17.	Kxd3	Nxf2+ 18.	Kd2	Rxb1 19.	Rxb1	Nxh1 20.	Ke2 and although black has recovered a pawn white is clearly winning, and the Nh1 is trapped. So eventually I played....} O-O {I castled, but actually Fritz's evaluation has changed from slight advantage for black to plus 1 to white. So maybe this innocent move was the losing mistake and I should have gone in for other complications with Ne4 or Ng4.} 16. Nd2 {White starts to develop his knights and rooks.} Rfc8 {I'd like to maintain mastery of the 1st rank.} 17. Ngf3 {But I can't! I decided to exchange a pair of rooks. Instead of 17. Ngf3 Fritz likes a4 or exchanging rooks.} Rxh1 {I thought better for him to end up with a rook on h1 not doing much, rather than on a1 where it is at least protecting the a pawn and maybe positioned to help the a pawn advance.} 18. Rxh1 Nd7 {This is probably another mistake. Fritz is still liking Ne4 or Ng4.} 19. a4 {As recommended by Fritz.} Nxe5 {Likewise.} 20. Nxe5 {Obvious recapture.} Be8 {The only square for the bishop.} 21. d4 {Fritz agrees that this is the best move for white.} f6 {Preparing to re-develop the bishop on the other side of the board.} 22. Nd3 {Knight drops back.} Bg6 {Hoping for 23. Rc1??? Bxd3+ winning for me. I rather expected 23. Nf4 Bf7, but my opponent finds something much better. What would you play here dear reader?} 23. Nc5 {Did you find it? Of course, if 23....Bxc5 24. Rc1 and white regains the piece without losing the pawn.} a5 {As I am losing, two pawns down with now minimal compensation, I try and avoid piece exchanges, and move my a pawn to safty, making his b pawn backward on a semi-open file.} 24. Rc1 {Finally mobilising his rook.} Kf7 {Centralising my king.} 25. Rc3 {Not sure of the point of this move. Fritz prefers f3. My opponent says "I did think of 25 f3 but I wanted to manoeuvre the knight from d2 to d3 and I thought it wouldn't harm to overprotect b3. Besides there is no need to hurry." } Ke8 {My king is coming over towards the queenside to help matters there.} 26. Nf3 {He calmly manoeuvres his knight.} Bf7 {Protecting d5 and stopping his knight from coming in on e6} 27. Ne1 {Continuing....} Rc7 {Stopping his knight from hopping in on b7.} 28. Ned3 {Completing his knight manoeuvres.} Kd8 {Maybe I can use the king to stop his rook coming in along the c file I thought.} 29. Kd2 {Calmly improving the king position before the break.} Bd6 {Hitting h2} 30. h3 {Stopping any problem there.} Ke7 {I couldn't see what else to do} 31. b4 {The break comes.} axb4 {I take.} 32. Nxb4 {He takes back.} f5 {I decided to try and exchange some pawns on the king side.} 33. Nbd3 {This seems to have worried him. My opponent says "33 Nbd3 overprotects the knight on c5."} g5 {So I push again.} 34. a5 {This a pawn is a winner.} f4 {I continue} 35. a6 {So does he} fxe3+ {I take.} 36. fxe3 {He takes back.} Ra7 {I try and block the pawn.} 37. Rb3 {Threatening a winning check on b7.} Kf6 {Avoiding the check, but....} 38. Rb6 {The only way to protect the bishop was Ke7 which then allows the check on b7, so I resigned. Thanks for reading, please leave or comment or two and score it on the star system, so I know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
