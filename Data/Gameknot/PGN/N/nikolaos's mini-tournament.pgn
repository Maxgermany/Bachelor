1. e4 {Good thing I watched this guy's other games before we played. It helped me prepare for his unorthodox style of play. } e6 {One would expect French opening here...} 2. d4 c6 {An unusual position here.. I actually expected this since he did it in one of his previous games in the Mini-tournament.} 3. f4 {He didn't make his move to take the center, so I went on with it.} h6 4. Nf3 {Preparing to castle king-side...} Nf6 5. Nc3 Na6 {Bad move by black... He gave me the perfect opportunity to take out his knight without losing tempo, and weaken his pawn structure...} 6. Bxa6 bxa6 7. O-O Nh7 {Black here aims to take out my F pawn, and leave the G file semi-open so that he can place his rook @ G8 (which could give me a headache)} 8. a3 {This move was a preparation for b4. I wanted to have my black squared bishop take the long diagonal, and move my knight on c3 all the way to g3 in preparation for a king side attack...} g5 {dangerous move by black... now his king will have to stay in the middle of the board...} 9. Ne5 {Now I'm aiming for his f pawn. Things would grim for him if I am able to move my queen to h5...} Bg7 {Here, I actually thought about sacrificing my knight with Nxf7 then Qh5+, followed by fxg5 which could look promising. But I decided it was too risky since he can easily defend his king with Qe7, and placing his king @ g8. I know I would have had a much stronger position at that point, but I thought it wasn't worth the risk. So I decided to break his center instead so that I can have my a rook help with the attack later on. } 10. d5 Bxe5 11. fxe5 {black's f pawn (and thus his king) is in big trouble at this point. he certainly can't move it forward because Qh5+ would give him a big problem. } cxd5 12. exd5 Nf8 13. Qf3 {Black's best defense here would be Rh7, IMO...} f5 {game over.. :)} 14. Qh5+ Ke7 15. d6# {}
