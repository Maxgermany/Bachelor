[Round "1"]
[White "Napoleon "]
[Black "Bertrand "]
[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {Napoleon decides to kick off with Reti. Nf3} Nc6 {The general responds with Nc6. Seems odd because he should give his c-pawn the option to be played to c5 but it's still resonable.} 2. e4 {e4 comes instead. i recommend continueing with c4 or g3.} e5 {And now suddenly it transposes. Now they might as well have played 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6.} 3. d4 {The Scottish opening was very common back then. People usually enjoyed to be offensive at the 19th century and scottish was an offensive move.} Nxd4 {weak. But the general wasn't considered to be a great chess player anyways. Now after 4. Nxd4 exd4 5. Qxd4 white has managed to centralize a strong queen in the center. Queens should normally not be played early in the opening if they will get knocked back with tempo but the queen wont be knocked back on d4 that easily.} 4. Nxd4 {I think 4. Nxe5 was possibly even better.} exd4 5. Bc4 {Bc4?! not necessarily a poor move. Napoleon did see Qxd4 but he decides to gambit that pawn for a better development.} Bc5 {Logical development. Now Qxd4 is out of question.} 6. c3 {offering another gambit pawn for faster development.} Qe7 {The general hopes that if 7.cxd4 Qxe4+ etc. winning the d-pawn.} 7. O-O {Now of course 7. ... Qxe4 runs into 8. Re1 winning the queen. Napoleon just continue to develop} Qe5 {Qe5? wasting a development tempo. black hopes to keep the d4 pawn.} 8. f4 {Now we see that Napoleon gains tempo on the queen.} dxc3+ {black sees that he can't hold the d-pawn anymore so he takes with check.} 9. Kh1 cxb2 {Hopes that if 10. fxe5 bxa1=Q winning material perhaps?  But now Napoleon decides to crush his general... try to see what move Napoleon played before scrolling down.} 10. Bxf7+ {Bxf7. A typical Tal-move. However if Kxf7 we get 11.fxe5+ which just wins.} Kd8 {so he played Kd8} 11. fxe5 {now Napoleon decides to take the queen and sacrifice his rook!} bxa1=Q {A Tal-like move. Napoleon sacrifices a rook here.} 12. Bxg8 {if Rxg8 then 13. Qb3! threatening both Bb2 and Qxg8 winning.} Be7 {decides to be defensive.} 13. Qb3 {Comes anyways threatening Bb2.} a5 {a5. Looks weird in this critical position however Now Napoleon found another Tal-like move. Try to see what move he found before scrolling down.} 14. Rf8+ {Rf8!! wins. Forced mate here.} Bxf8 {only move} 15. Bg5+ Be7 {only move again since Ke8 is met by Qf7#} 16. Bxe7+ Kxe7 {Again only move.} 17. Qf7+ Kd8 18. Qf8# {His Last rook sacrifice led to a forced mate. Nicely done by Napoleon.}
