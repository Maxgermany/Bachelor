Ne4 {The first tentative thrust.} Nxe4 14. Bxe4 f5 15. Bd3 {The exchange leaves a peaceful-looking position...} c5 16. dxc5 {I don't want my opponent's Q side pawns to storm forward, so I exchange one off.} Nxc5 17. Be2 {I'd rather not give up a minor exchange without a reason.} e5 18. Bc3 {I switch my Bishop to a more active diagonal, pointing toward Black's King.} Be4 19. Qc1 {Ducking clear.} Nb3 20. Qe1 {And again. My opponent in this game also played for the attack.} Bc6 21. Rb1 {I'm not sure why my opponent didn't play 20... NxR, but I'm glad of a chance to slide my Rook clear.} e4 22. Ng5 {I have to move my Knight, allowing Black to win a Pawn.} Bxh2+ 23. Kh1 {Forced.} Be5 24. f4 {I act quickly to seal the dangerous diagonal.} Bf6 25. Qh4 {I elect to launch a counterattack. The immediate threat is QxP mate.} h6 26. Ne6 {Black *could* choose here to exchange Queens [26... BxQ 27 NxQ] but elects not to.} Qd6 27. Bxf6 {The Queens remain, but some of the wood does come off.} Rxf6 28. Nd4 {The only square.} Nd2 29. Nxf5 {A mistake, as Black can simply play RxN and still has my Rooks forked with his own Knight.} Qe6 30. Nd4 {Black fails to take advantage, and I harass his Q again.} Qd5 31. Rbd1 {I remove one of my Rooks from attack.} Nc4 32. Nxc6 {Having equalized the material, I begin swapping off the minor pieces.} Qxc6 33.

Rd4 {Bringing more firepower to bear.} c3 37. bxc3 {Black pushes, and I trade Pawns.} Qxc3 38. a4 {My own QRP was under fire.} Qxe3 39. Rxe4 {Another pair of Pawns leave the board. Black again has the chance to exchange Queens...} Qg3 40. Qf2 {... and does not. He is clearly trying to geenerate a mating attack.} Qg4 41. Qc2 {I bring my Q to an open area and attack the R.} Rg3 42. Re8+ {Now I go on the attack.} Kf7 43. Rfe1 {Linking my Rooks.} Rxf4 44. Re1e7+ {I willingly give up a Pawn to generate a dangerous attack, looking to mate.} Kf6 45. Qb2+ {Continuing to push.} Kf5 46. Rf8+ {I force the Black K to the KN file, enabling me to win Black's Q.} Kg5 47. Rxg7+ {Black's own aggressive play has led to this position.} Kh5 48.
