1. e4 {I am not an e4 player, but as this is a thematic Sicilian, and I am a Sicilian devotee for life, I jumped in feet first.  This game features a Shveshnikov Sicilian, which my opponent plays well in the beginning, however, loses the thread and his game quickly falls apart.  The mating attack at the end is quite amazing.} c5 { } 2. Nf3 {Just your typical open Sicilian.} d6 {Not your typical approach to the Shvesh!  2...Nc6 is seen more.  We will transpose, however, as neither of us apparently were concerned with any advantage that the move order might have conveyed.} 3. d4 { } cxd4 { } 4. Nxd4 { } Nc6 {More typical is 4...Nf6 followed by ...g6 or ...e6, with a Dragon or Sheveningen respectively.} 5. Nc3 {I didn't want to commit the dark-squared bishop just yet, as Black still has the option of playing the Classical set up with ...Nf6, and I wanted to be able to enter the Rauzer with Bg5.} e5 {A hypermodern choice!  This anti-positional "looking" move has become a great favorite of mine.  Named after its discoverer, Evgeny Shveshnikov, this move weakens the d6-pawn, creates an outpost for White on d5 and keeps the Black dark-squared bishop hemmed in.  So why play it?  Because of the imbalance of dynamic chances versus structual disadvantage.  Black will typically have the initiative.  Black will also typically have the two bishops.  These two factors go a long way in the respectability of this opening.  Some of the top level players who have employed this system: Topalov, Kramnik, Leko, Carlsen, Shirov and Radjabov.} 6. Ndb5 {Although, the Black knight is on f6, rather than the black pawn on d6, we slide right back into the main lines.} a6 {This shouldn't need explanation.} 7. Na3 { } Nf6 { } 8. Bg5 {Beginning play against the d5-square.  In many lines White will give up the two bishops to gain control over d5.  If Black is ever allowed to play ...d5, then White has problems equalizing.} Be7 {This is the first positional mistake.  Although, we can still get back to the main lines after 9. Nd5 b5, I decide to cash in on my opponents strategic inaccuracy.  More typical and best is 8...b5; 9. d5 Be7, when White's best move is 10. Bxf6.} 9. Bxf6 { } Bxf6 { } 10. Nd5 {It's still not too late to get to the main line after 10...b5.  This keeps the White knight on a3 out of c4.  White will then have the option of c3 (the better of the two) and c4, intending to play Nc2 and Nce3 to cement control of d5.  Black can then attempt an ...f5 break.} O-O {Leaving the c4 square open, however, I played a little too automatically, and again allowed my opponent to get back to the main lines.} 11. c3 {A slight inaccuracy on my part.  The immediate Nc4 is better.} Bg5 {This was the last chance to play ...b5 under favorable circumstances.  This move is typical of the Shvesh as it activates the bishop and gets out of the way of a possible ...f5.  If Black had a pawn on ...b5, he would be golden!} 12. h4 {A very weakening move, which is probably not as good as the simple 12. Nc4.  I was getting a little ambitious here and got lucky that I didn't get punished later on.  If ...b5 were in, there would be no way I would play this move.} Bh6 {I wasn't really planning g4, as I have seen in other Shvesh's, and it's not even really a threat, as Black will often play ...g6 before ...f5.  On h6 the bishop can scoot back to g7 if necessary.  Since Black can beat any attack, I decided to improve my position in other ways.  By getting my problem knight into the game via c4 and b6.} 13. Nc4 {This knight also pressures d6.} f5 {Black gets his play underway without hesitation.  An admirable plan, but now I win the d6-pawn.} 14. Ndb6 {Preparing to exchange off one of Black's bishops and uncovering a double attack against the backward d6-pawn.} Rb8 {...Be6 was desperate, but maybe it's a bit better.} 15. Nxc8 { } Rxc8 {Now the c4 knight has its day in the sun!} 16. Nxd6 { } Rc7 { } 17. Nxf5 {Two pawns up, but my development is really bad and my king doesn't look like it will be safe anywhere.  I have to evaluate this as a clear plus for White though.  Black really has no way to get at the White king and my pieces will come out quickly.  That knight on f5 is a beast too.} Qf6 { } 18. Bc4+ {Development with tempo.} Kh8 { } 19. Qd6 {The exchange of queens only favors White here.  Not only does it make my king safer by eliminating a potentially dangerous attacker, but it also makes the material imbalance more decisive in any endgame that might arise.} Qxd6 { } 20. Nxd6 {Black's pieces are really uncoordinated.} Rd7 {He can try to occupy the d-file, however, after my next move followed by Ke2, I should be able to liquiate the rooks and transpose into a won ending.} 21. Rd1 g6 {This looks like an attempt to reroute the bishop.} 22. h5 {It also gives me a chance to open the h-file against the king.} g5 {Pretty much forced.  Just a few moves ago, White was almost completely undeveloped, now even the h1-rook can be considered developed.  It can also seek greener pastures via h3 if necessary.} 23. Be6 {Trying to force the rook off of the d-file.} Re7 24. Bb3 Rf6 {If 24...Rd7; 25. Nf5 Rxd1; 26. Kxd1 Rd8 ; 27. Ke2 Bf8; 28. Rd1 liqudates the rooks and the Knight of f5 dominates the bishop.} 25. Nf5 {The plan is to play Rd5, Ke2 and Rhd1 and Rd8 will lead to mate, if Black doesnt make room for the king or guard the back rank.  The rook will then penetrate to the 7th rank in any case.} Rxf5 {A little extreme, but that knight was worth close to a rook.} 26. exf5 Bg7 {This is the final mistake, which unleashes a fatal attack.} 27. h6 Bf8 28. Rh5 {Threatening to play Rxg5, when mate is looming on g8.} Re8 {Now capturing the g-pawn can be met with Bxh6.} 29. f6 {Again the idea is to play f7 and Rxg5, followed by Rg8.} Nd8 30. Rd7 b5 {Black is completely helpless.} 31. Rg7 {The rook can't be taken because of hg#.} Ne6 32. f7 {Here Black resigns.  He is mated by force after 32...Nxg7; 33. hxg7  Kxg7; 34. fe=Q and it's mate in a couple of moves.  Thanks to my opponent.}
