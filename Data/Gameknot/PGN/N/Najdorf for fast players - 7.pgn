1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Mini-tournament based on 6. Bg5 from Najdorf. I have found out that it is not an obvious move for white... I guess our guest enasab wanted it to be studied. Unfortunately our level is not very good. Not sure we are very decisive to choose this or this move.} e6 {looks like the strongest black answer.} 7. f4 {looks like the most obvious black one.} Nbd7 8. Qf3 Qc7 {stronger and stronger.} 9. O-O-O b5 {the natural move for Najdorf} 10. a3 Rb8 11. f5 {this is a little bit less obvious but still valuable} e5 12. Nb3 Be7 13. Nd5 {and this is the blunder. sorry vonzeppelin...} Nxd5 14. Rxd5 Bxg5+ {win a piece} 15. Kb1 Bb7 16. Rd1 Nc5 17. Qc3 {i could have taken another pawn here, but i preferred to ensure the situation. I have lost too many winning situation by being greedy.} Rc8 {so the queen is now protected and the e-pawn is still doubled attacked.} 18. Bd3 {one protection is not enough} Nxe4 19. Qe1 Nc5 20. Nxc5 Qxc5 {simplifying, better to me.} 21. h4 {gives me the opportunity to protect my weakest pawn.} Be7 22. g4 {Oh, I see! :-)} Bxh1 {gloub.} 23. Qxh1 Qf2 24. Qb7 {another attempt to be dangerous... Could have given back some pawn to destroy the g-h ones...} Qc5 {but i prefer to come back... } 25. g5 {so you DON'T want to eat my a-pawn?} Qc6 {then you wont} 26. Qa7 Ra8 27. Qe3 {and back home...} Qc5 {come on, exchange!} 28. Qe4 Rc8 {i hesitated to castle, but really the only thing the white has is space and by castling i would have offered more...} 29. Rf1 f6 {so let us cut this space.} 30. g6 d5 31. Qg2 e4 {and that is all folks: cannot go back to e2: i would eat c-pawn...} 32. Bxe4 dxe4 33. Qxe4 {and white is still alive and boring :-)} Qc6 34. Qe2 hxg6 35. Re1 Rc7 {and actually still very boring, threatening mate every minute... } 36. fxg6 Kd8 {let us castle on the other side... :-)} 37. h5 Qxc2+ {or you are boring, i said to myself... i give you a rook for a pawn...} 38. Qxc2 Rxc2 39. Kxc2 Rxh5 {and for a second one...} 40. Rg1 Kd7 41. b4 Rg5 {and for a third...} 42. Rxg5 {no? you don't want to keep your rook?} fxg5 {better for me...} 43. Kd2 Ke6 44. Ke2 Bf6 45. Kf3 Bb2 {gloub again...}
