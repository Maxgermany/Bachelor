1. e4 {This game is great. I sacrafice my queen on move six!} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 {allowing black to take free rein at my pawn on e4.} dxe4 4. Ng5 {But prehaps I can win it back?} Nf6 {Alas no.} 5. Bc4 {So I eye down f7.} Bg4 {One would think the only way to save the queen was to play Be2. But the beauty of this opening is it doesn't need the queen.} 6. Qxg4 {Qxg4! so now we are underway. The psychological value of this move is not the only advantage to it. It is actually a very sound opening.} Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 {Only square.} 8. Be6+ {Ke8 would invite a draw by repetition. This being the point of the opening, white gets two pieces for the queen, better piece coordination, the chance to create a bind on black as well as great intuitive and development.} Kc7 {The beauty about the pawn being on c6 instead of c5 is that black needs to waste an extra tempo moving either his queen or king to avoid the queen/king fork.} 9. Bxg4 Qe8 {Black looks to prevent the fork at f7. Black doesn't realise I was never interested in Nf7.} 10. Ne6+ {The idea being to create a bind on blacks position by closing lines and preventing development.} Kb6 11. Nc3 Na6 12. a3 {It's pretty cool that even though white has gambited his queen he is still able to play such defensive moves as these.} Qg6 13. Bh3 {All there is really.} Nc5 {Forcing me to trade knights and thus nullify my attack.} 14. Nxc5 Kxc5 15. f5 {f5! this may block the h3-c8 diagonal but it forces the queen to a more passive spot. Note that of all the squares available to black the queen is only safe on h5, f7 and e8 since any other square either loses the queen to a royal fork or a discovered attack.} Qe8 16. Nxe4+ {Taking the pawn with tempo.} Kb6 17. d3 {I need to open lines for my bishop and this seemed a little more solid than d4.} e6 {? this was done to open lines for the bishop but the free protected passed pawn this creates is just too powerful.} 18. fxe6 Bc5 {Black is looking to trade pieces so that I will have no attack and his material advantage will be bigger.  Little does he know that one of the strategies of this opening is that white looks for any chance to trade knights for bishops.} 19. Nxc5 Kxc5 20. b4+ {Opens up the a1-h8 diagonal, wins more tempo and space as well as cuts off more squares around the black king.} Kb6 21. Bb2 Qe7 {Protects g7.} 22. O-O-O {I take the chance to develop my rook and bring my king into relative safety.} Kc7 23. Rde1 Rhf8 {controls the f file.} 24. Rhf1 {I was looking for chances to play Rf7!! I just need to get rid of blacks pesky rooks to do so.} b6 25. Kd1 {I thought I should protect the rook just incase anything opens up.} Rxf1 26. Rxf1 Rf8 {More trading down.} 27. Be5+ Kb7 {The point of b6 before.} 28. Rxf8 {I couldn't see anything better. It doesn't really matter though. that passed pawn is a monster and more than makes up for the -1 material defect.} Qxf8 29. Ke2 Qe7 30. c4 {taking space.} Kc8 {?allows the following tactic.} 31. Bxg7 {! White must be winning.} Kd8 32. Be5 Qf8 33. d4 c5 {This would be alright if it wasn't for...} 34. d5 {! connected passed pawns} cxb4 35. d6 {! those two connected passed pawns on the 6th rank are monsters. Black will have a hard time staving them off.} Qg8 {Better is Qh6 with the threat of Qh5! forking king and bishop (Qe8 does the same thing)} 36. axb4 {To get rid of any complications.} Ke8 {his was only a friendly match and we weren't writing the moves down, so I'm unsure if the next few moves are exactly the same. I am reasonably sure that they are though and the position is defiantly right at move forty.} 37. c5 {Looking for three connected passed pawns on the 6th rank!} bxc5 38. bxc5 {Black is lost here. Amazing considering Black has a queen on an open board.} Qg5 39. d7+ Kd8 40. Bd6 {threatening e7#black has to give up his queen which loses on the spot. His only try is Qh5+ but nothing can be made of it. Black should resign here.} Qg7 41. e7+ Qxe7+ 42. Bxe7+ Kxe7 {And my teacher congratulated me then resigned. He tells me he now has a new opening for Blitz games. Not bad for a thousand player eh? This was just a friendly game and I'm sure we both played far from perfectly but despite that I am still very happy with this win. Having now played this I think the opening is defiantly sound and worth trying again.  Please comment and rate, In would like to see weather others think this opening is sound.}
