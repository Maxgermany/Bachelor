1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {Najdorf sixth move Bg5 was the premice of this tournament organized by enasab. It is very hard for me, because it leads to very complexe possibilities where it is usually hard for the kings to protect themselves. Caslting seems unusual with this opening. Here is a game where I succeeded to enter into clean lines, where I think I feel better.} e6 {probably the safest with 6th black} 7. f4 {and the most agressive answer from white's 7} Qc7 8. Bxf6 gxf6 {this is one of the reason why black have difficulties to castle. Be7 or Nbd7 could have prevented it, but it is too late here.} 9. Qd2 Bh6 {interesting pin} 10. g3 {free the queen} Nc6 {queen has now to protect two pieces, or white has to exchange a good knight.} 11. O-O-O {castling and defending-attacking! Good choice!} Ke7 {probably preparing the connexion between the rooks} 12. Kb1 {AS tartakover said once: "safety first"} b5 {classical from black... and safety is over for white...} 13. a3 {obvious response, but white has to be prepared for b4 anyway after an eventual Rb8} Bb7 {black prefers to change the attack angle. } 14. Bg2 Nxd4 {the exchange is the tempo to attack on e4.} 15. Qxd4 e5 {simplifying and cleaning the board... Actually I was happy about this move from y opponent: i like clean boards...} 16. fxe5 fxe5 17. Qf2 {dark black bishop is free, at the cost of light black bishop mobility... And my queen is now pointing on another target.} f6 {not quite sure this was clever.} 18. Rhf1 {forming attack} Bg7 19. Bh3 {i had more than one idea in my mind. 1) the knight could easily take care of e4 and, in case of a5-b4, could just go on d5, forcing the exchange with the bishop. 2) continuing the attack on f column 3) continuously threatening d-line 4) doubling the rooks potentially on both column 5) putting the rooks before the queen thanks to some tactic moves.} Kf7 {well, whatever... this is strange.} 20. Qf5 {tactic move} Bc8 {of course} 21. Qh5+ {so his king move helped me here} Kf8 22. Nd5 {the knight became a real attacker... I'll be prouf of him later.} Qf7 {he obviously needs to simplify.} 23. Bg4 {i calculated that by letting him choosing the exchange, I end up with better positioning} Bxg4 {could have been the queens too. he chose the bishops} 24. Qxg4 h5 {this one was not expected, but not exactly a nuisance either.} 25. Qf5 Rh6 26. Rf2 {doubling... on which column?} Rd8 {good prevention by black!!!} 27. Rfd2 {but it won't be enough. Do you see that a piece is now the master of the game?} Ke8 28. Nb4 {yes: impossible to protect both pawn a and d!} Bf8 {he chose d -probably the most logical option.} 29. Nxa6 {gloub!} Qd7 {let us exchange queens?} 30. Qxd7+ {by accepting the exchange, i thought i could more easily show my new superiority, not only material, but space too... it occured not to be that clear} Rxd7 {i had in mind a little trick} 31. Nc5 {TRICK! (tto big for him to fall into, but...} Ra7 32. Nd3 Kf7 33. Nc1 {... what a knifht! He attacked, now he will efficiently defend...} Ra4 {my big fear was that he could sacrifice f-pawn to have a good d and e advance... but he didn't do it.} 34. Re2 Ke6 35. Na2 {great knight} Ra8 {yes, preventing Nc3.} 36. Rd5 {preparing a double attack on b4, but there were other possible threats in black pocket.} Rb8 37. Red2 {not Nc3 now, because b4 is good to annoy me.} Rg6 {preparing the counter-attack on g and h columns} 38. Nc3 {i finally decided to do it... } b4 39. axb4 Rxb4 {logical!} 40. Rd2d3 {counter-preparing the attack on g column} h4 {but i would have been glad with an exchange, so i let him do.} 41. b3 {i started my slow motion to the north pole...} hxg3 42. hxg3 {better than the rook taking. indeed. If Rxg3, his Rxg3 too and after my h-pawn takes... f5! threatening to take one of his defenders to the rook and engaging the King on King-side.} Rg4 {double attack on my poor pawn... } 43. Kb2 {i saw that by attack his rook, i could give me back some space...} Rg7 {but he can also double the rooks.} 44. Ka3 Rgb7 {that day is done.} 45. Kb2 Be7 46. Rf3 {Hey! Did I let my pawn without protection? (Knight is already protecting the rook)} Rxe4 47. Rxd6+ {NO! ThAT WAS THE KEY MOVE!!!!! I am glad with it!} Kxd6 {it did not change to use the bishop here} 48. Nxe4+ {because of that move, I am pretty sure to win now.} Ke6 49. g4 {i just have to play cautiously: my own king is too far to protect my pieces.} Rb8 50. Kc3 Rg8 51. Rg3 f5 {and this is a terrible mistake, forgetting the intermediary-check} 52. gxf5+ {check, i have a pawn and the possibility ot wind rook...} Kf7 {... but he is a good player too. } 53. Rxg8 {now with two pawns, my king close to his last pawn, I can exchange towers.} Kxg8 54. Kc4 Kf7 55. Kd5 {there is no more counter-plan...} Bf6 56. c4 Bh8 57. c5 Ke7 58. c6 {how to stop so may enemies?}
