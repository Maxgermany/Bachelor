1. e3 {Standard opening to a game which turned out to be one of the best I have played} d5 {and response} 2. f4 Bf5 3. Bd3 Bxd3 {Exchange of bishops} 4. cxd3 e6 5. g4 {Forming a diagonal defence along the right side} g6 6. g5 f5 7. Nf3 {Now moving the knight out with a view to forcing the opposing king out.} c5 8. Ne5 {Knight advancing on the king} Bg7 {Idle threat from opposing bishop} 9. Nf7 {Knight has now forced the king to take action} Kxf7 {Now out of place this has eliminated the kings ability to "Castle"} 10. b4 {Looking back, I cannot see why I made this move. I can only assume I didn't see the bishop.} Bxa1 {The bishop now at a1 will pose a significant problem later.} 11. bxc5 h5 12. gxh6 e.p. Qh4+ {Queen advancing on me prompting evasive action} 13. Kf1 { } Rxh6 {rook following queen to advance on my right side} 14. Qb3 {I push out my queen to offer support to pawn at c5} b6 {Opposing pawn at b6 threatens} 15. cxb6 {I advance my pawn } Qh3+ {First check } 16. Ke1 {Defensive retreat} Qf3 {Queen clearing path for rook to follow on down} 17. Rf1 {Defensive threat on opposing queen} Qg2 {Reposition} 18. b7 {Placing my pawn at b7 threatens a vulnerable rook and sets me up for a possible promotion.} Rxh2 {Rook now advancing to back up the queens attack} 19. Kd1 {With the threat of checkmate if the queen moves to e2 I retreat to the safety of an escape route.} Qxf1+ {Of course this means I lose a rook and get into check again. At this point being 12 points down I was thinking that the game was pretty much over and slowed down my moves focussing on other games. Had this been a casual game I might well have resigned at this point. But this was a mini tournament and every half point counted. Eventually I started to look seriously at a plan of recovery and used the "Analyse" facility to structure a way out.} 20. Kc2 {First I needed to get out the way whilst being mindful of the bishop at a1} Rh1 {Rook now backing up Queen along the first rank} 21. Bb2 {With nowhere for my king to go I needed to try and eliminate the bishop} Qxb1+ {Another piece gone and 15 points down, but I still have an escape route planned.} 22. Kc3 {My bishop at b2 will go, but the close proximity of both queens and my king secures their parts in this game} Bxb2+ {Simple check but now takes me to 18 points down} 23. Qxb2 {Countered} Rc1+ {Rook now comes along to increase the pressure.} 24. Kb3 {Need to keep the king close to protect the queen} Qxd3+ {Permanent pressure from opposing queen causing a frantic dance. 16 points down but still I have a strategy planned.} 25. Ka4 {With the queen no longer under attack I can retreat a little further } Qc4+ {Another check} 26. Qb4 {Blocked again} Rb1 {At this point my opponent made an error by threatening my queen. Retrospectively I think he should have put me in check with his queen at c6 or c2. This would have given him the advantage of threatening my pawns at b7 and a2 and also capturing my queen with his rook. Instead the rook was placed at b1 which allowed me to eliminate his queen.} 27. Qxc4 {Queen gone} Rxb7 {OK. So now I have reduced his attacking power dramatically whilst sacrificing my planned pawn promotion. The focus now is on destroying as many pieces as I can and advancing the pawn from a2 to secure a future promotion.} 28. Qc8 {Moving in on the rooks} Rb2 {Rook retreat} 29. Ka3 {Bringing my king back to protect the pawn} Rxd2 {Simple loss of pawn enables me to work on the rook at a8} 30. Qb7+ {Tables turning now, this check has enabled me to take the rook} Nd7 {Knight moves to protect} 31. Qxa8 {Rook gone, now to work on everything else} Re2 {Clearly the opponents rook is intent on doing the same} 32. Qxa7 {Getting queen in position for check} Ngf6 {Counter move, protecting his knight} 33. Qd4 {An idle threat from my queen} Ng4 {which forced an evasive move, not sure why} 34. Qa4 {Getting back in position for check at d7} Rxe3+ {In check again with the loss of another pawn} 35. Kb2 {Evasive move} Nf2 {The knight is brought in to assist the rook} 36. Qxd7+ {Now I am able to eliminate another piece and threaten the king} Kf6 {Little bit of dancing now to keep up the pressure} 37. Qd8+ {Reposition my queen, watching for opportunities} Kf7 {with the knight poised to attack at d3 or d1 I need to move the king to safety} 38. Kc2 {advancing on the rook and knight places me in a better defensive position to retreat} Re2+ {check, but easy to retreat} 39. Kb3 {Now out of harms way} Rd2 {Not quite sure why this move was played, but it has given me a good opportunity - with the current position of his king and the move just made gives me the chance to move in on the rook} 40. Qc7+ {Check - with only 4 moves for the king he chooses to go under cover of the pawns} Kf6 {This, however, was all part of my plan} 41. Qc3+ {check and capture of rook} Ke7 {king retreat} 42. Qxd2 {rook gone} Ne4 {attack on queen} 43. Qb4+ {counter attack on king} Kf6 {At this point my opponent must have seen the obvious move and offered a "draw". Having come back from -18 to +4 I was not going to do that. With this in mind I did not see the checkmate with my queen at f8. Instead I focussed on promoting my pawn up the left side.} 44. a4 {It was only after I had submitted my move that I saw the missed checkmate. This became a little frustrating as my opponent tends to use nearly 15 days per move when he is losing.} g5 {response to attack pawn} 45. Qf8+ {check} Kg6 {The next few moves are made looking for opportunites to eliminate the last knight} 46. Qe8+ {check} Kf6 {defense} 47. a5 {advance pawn again} gxf4 {lose pawn, Still part of the plan} 48. Qf8+ {check} Ke5 {king now in good position to be attacked from h8 and h2} 49. a6 {advance pawn} f3 {counter advance} 50. a7 {still moving up} f2 {still moving down} 51. Qh8+ {time now to eliminate the pawn at f2. In this attack the king can only move on the diagonal which can also be threatened from h2} Nf6 {knight blocks threat} 52. Qh2+ {and there we have it. Another pawn going down} Ke4 {defense} 53. Qxf2 {pawn gone} Ng4 {counter attack} 54. Qb6 {now to get the 2nd queen} f4 {but first a little more elimination} 55. Qxe6+ {and threatening} Ne5 {now with the knight locked in place} 56. a8=Q {my 2nd queen} f3 {still advancing} 57. Qaxd5+ {moving in} Kf4 {Nearly there} 58. Qdxe5# {Finally. Its a real shame that the points earned are not proportional to the effort put in. But a good game which I thoroughly enjoyed.}
