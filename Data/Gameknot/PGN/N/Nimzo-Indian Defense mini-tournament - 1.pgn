1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 c6 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 b5 8. Bd3 Bb7 {All the games start from this position, with White to move. I had never done a Nimzo-Indian theme before this tournament,  but know it's a very popular defense.} 9. O-O Bb4 10. e4 {Now that I've castled, I can initiate complications. } O-O {My opponent, likewise, castles before plunging towards the middle game.} 11. e5 {A Knight on KB3, according to Fine and Znosko-Borovsky, is the best single piece available to protect a King that has castled King-side. So naturally, I drive it away while I have the opportunity.} Ne8 {The best available square. N-R4 would leave it exposed and vulnerable.} 12. Be3 {Naturally, development must be completed!} f6 {An attempt to negate my central wedge.} 13. Qc2 {I double along the diagonal.} Ba5 {A move seemingly without a purpose. According to Fine, it is better to have a bad plan than not to have a plan at all. Every move should have some purpose.} 14. Bxh7+ {I naturally take the free Pawn, a move that also exposes Black's King somewhat.} Kh8 {K-B2 would leave the King closer to his allies, although I'm not sure it would have made a huge difference.} 15. Qg6 {Naturally, I press forward with the Q. My Knight is also ready to join, and the Black King is momentarily denuded of defensive help.} fxe5 {An attempt to reduce the pressure.} 16. Ng5 {Bringing forward another attacking piece.} Qf6 {Black's previous move cleared this square. Needless to say, I have no intention of exchanging Queens!} 17. Qh5 {Threatening a deadly discovered check.} e4 {The correct move was 17... Q-R3, interrupting the potential discovery. Now I have a mate.} 18. Bg6+ {Black has but one move...} Kg8 {...and this is it.} 19. Qh7# {Fin.}
