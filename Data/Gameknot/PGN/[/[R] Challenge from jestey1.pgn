1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 a6 {A solid approach from Black – I knew that my opponent was most comfortable in attacking positions so I stayed away from the more provocative lines of the Sicillian such as the Schevenningen or Dragon.} 5. Nc3 Qc7 {The Taimanov Sicilian, one of the most solid Sicilian variations.} 6. Bd3 Nf6 7. f4 Bb4 8. Bd2 Nc6 9. Nf3 d6 10. O-O O-O 11. Kh1 {I'm not sure this is the most challenging move at White's disposal. Developing with, say, Qe2 or Qe1-h4 is probably more relevant to the struggle for the center. Still, White will have to make this move eventually, so it is safe, at least.} e5 {?! Striking out for freedom, but a bit premature. …b5 and …Bb7 is more solid.} 12. f5 {? Closing lines and weakening the center. This should not have worked out as well for White as it did in the game. There is no longer any hope of clearing the way for the Bd3 or the Rf1. White should embrace the tension in the center, since he is trying to open lines for his developed pieces. 12. f5 not only closes lines, it also hands the center over to Black, since without the f-pawn exerting pressure on Black's e-pawn, there is nothing to hold back the freeing advance …d5.  Instead, Nd5! Nxd5 13. exd5 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 (Bxh7+?!? Kxh7 15. Ng5+ is tempting, but after …Kg6! White has nothing better than Qxd2.) gives White a strong initiative.} Bxc3 {! Giving up the Bishop pair but paving the way for the thematic Sicilian break …d5, after which Black's active pieces will more than compensate for it. If Black does not play this move, then why did he play …e5?} 13. Bxc3 d5 {! The proud White center falls very quickly. Black can now claim full equality, at least.} 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Bd2 Rd8 {Perhaps …Re8 right away is more accurate. I was indulging in a pipe dream of …Nb4, Nxd3, and Bxf5, which was not going to happen.} 16. Qe1 {A good spot for the Queen, eyeing both Kingside and Queenside, controlling b4, and avoiding the Knight fork awaiting her on e2.} Re8 17. Be4 {?! This is one way to prevent …e4, but the Knight would be a better blockader after Ng5-e4. (Ng5 e4 18. Nxe4 just loses a pawn, since White has enough time to play Qh4 and safely break the pin.)} Nf6 18. c3 {?! Again, Rd1 was called for. There is no pressing need for c3, since c2, d4 and b4 are adequately covered. Even if the f3 Knight moved and Black did manage to get a Knight on d5, White could then play c3 with tempo and drive it away.} b5 19. Bg5 {! Putting the question to the Knight while Black has still not completed development. (I would usually have no problem with doubled pawns in return for a Bishop-for-Knight trade, but here it would leave my King far too exposed.) Notice that neither White nor Black have been terribly concerned about the possibility of Nxe4 so far, since as long as there's a pawn on f5, that Bishop is a non-factor. With the pawn's blockader about to go, however, the Bishop must be eliminated.} Nxe4 20. Qxe4 Bb7 {? A natural move that gets Black into big trouble. …f6! was necessary and good, after which Black would have a very comfortable game. I actually considered playing it, but underestimated White's threats and felt more comfortable breaking the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal. This oversight very well could have lost me the game!} 21. Qg4 {! White immediately takes the initiative. Now the threats come very fast, and there is no time for …f6 thanks to the pin on the g-file.} Kh8 {The opportunity for ...f6 is over, thanks to the pin on the g-file. Darn!  White threatens Bf6, Bh6 and f6, and I could find nothing better than to play this move, breaking the pin and allowing ...Rg8 if necessary.} 22. f6 {! of course, White rules out ...f6 right away, while forcing a disruption in the Black King's pawn shield.} g6 {What else? ...Rg8 23 fxg7+ Rxg7 24 Bf6 is no good, and so I am obliged to create holes around my King.} 23. Bh6 {! Again, White mixes attack with prophylaxis. This phase of the attack is very instructive because of how Black simultaneously snuffs out Black's defensive resources while increasing his own threats. Here, I had hoped to get in the liberating move ...h5, which would greatly slow down the White attack and give me time for counterplay. Instead, White blockades the h-pawn and hones in on g7. The one downside is that the Queen's route to h7, h6 and/or g7 is temporarily blocked.} e4 {!? What to do? White not only has a big attack, but has also prevented any immediately useful defensive move that Black might want to play. It might seem odd for me to "force" the White Knight to g5, where it already wanted to go anyways, but this move is motivated by sound practical logic: Black is not going to be able to defend against White's attack -- my pieces on the Queenside are just not going to get there in time. My only hope for survival, then, depends on getting some kind of counterattack going. Pushing the pawn does three things to help that: 1) It clears the h2-b8 diagonal for the Queen while giving the e-Rook more scope on the e-file; 2) It controls the f3-square while opening e5 for the Knight; and 3) It disrupts the timing of White's attack. White would prefer to play Qh4 first and Ng5 second, which retains control of e5 for a turn longer, but now he doesn't have that choice.} 24. Ng5 Ne5 {!? Again, forcing a move that White planned to play anyways. Now, however, Black's formerly pent-up pieces are starting to take up active posts in the center. White needs to be careful not to underestimate this activity. (As they say: "The best way to meet an attack on the flank is with an attack in the center.") } 25. Qh4 Kg8 {! White threatened Bg7+ Kg8 26. Qxh7#. Now, Bg7 can be met with ...h5, and White's attack has stalled. Still, White's pieces seem extremely threatening, and the situation is optically very grim for Black. For one thing, Nxh7 looks very strong. The Black position contains hidden resources which are easy to underestimate, however, and the game is far from over. My opponent, thinking I was on the ropes, probably expected a resignation soon after his next move…} 26. Nxh7 {? This seemingly crushing move actually loses for White! How? ...Kxh7 26. Bg7+ Kg8 27. Qh8# seems pretty convincing...} Nf3 {But Black doesn't have to take the Knight! This counter-sacrifice neutralizes White's attack completely. The attacking White pieces which seemed so  menacing a few moves ago now trip over each other clumsily -- the f-pawn blocks f6 from the Knight, while the Knight and Bishop temporarily block the h-file for the White Queen as effectively as if they were Black pawns. After this move, Black poses a series of powerful threats which do not allow White the time to rearrange his pieces and continue the attack. By repeatedly activating my pieces while forcing White into reactive mode, I am able to completely shift the initiative to Black.    It seems clear that White did not have the option of moving the Knight away from the defense of f3 last move, and so developing with Re1 seems best, with the dangerous plan of Re1-e3-h3, for example, which is hard for Black to meet. White needed to continue the slow buildup of an attack by mixing threats with prophylaxis as seen before. Still, while it seems clear in hindsight that 26. Nxh7 is a mistake, it is hard to criticize a move that wins convincingly in all variations except for one improbable sacrifice. White was understandably eager to cash in on the strong attacking position he had built up with patience and care, and in his position I would have hardly expected the tables to turn so quickly, either.} 27. gxf3 {? Instead of accepting the sacrifice, White could have gone for the endgame after Qh3 Qxh2+ 28. Qxh2 Nxh2 29. Kxh2 Kxh7, where Black may have a slight edge due to better-placed Rooks and the vulnerability of the f-pawn, but White has good chances for equality. Though objectively speaking Qh3 gives good chances to hold while the text move loses outright, I cannot blame my opponent for continuing to play for a win in a position which had seemed so overwhelmingly better just a move ago. The Knight sacrifice seemed desperate even to me, and I doubt that many players of our level would have seriously considered declining it.} exf3 {The first surprise threat: ...f2+ is mate in two.} 28. Rf2 {Qf2 is met simply by ...Kxh7, where material is even and Black has an overwhelming position. After Kg1, Black has a number of good options. One simple path to advantage is ...Qc5+ 29 Qf2/d4, (Rf2 Re4 as in the game, except that White has self-pinned) and after the trade of Queens and ...Kxh7 we again come to a much better ending for Black. I would not be surprised, however, if Black could try for even more by keeping the Queens on with 28...Re4.} Re4 {Threat number 2, dislodging the Queen while clearing space for the a-Rook.} 29. Qg5 {?! It would be more challenging to play Qh3, after which Black still has the same crushing attack as in the game, but at least White has some material to show for it in case Black messes up. Now I can win back my piece without disrupting my attack in any real way.} Rae8 {! Threat number 3. Even if Black wasn't threatening mate on e1, the Knight still has nowhere to go and Black is in no hurry to round it up. In the last three moves, Black has been able to activate every piece for the attack, while White's position has not improved in any real way and the White pieces are no longer well placed for attack or defense. I was even startled by how fast things had turned around, let alone my shocked opponent!} 30. Qg1 Kxh7 {Recovering the piece with yet another gain of time. (Threat number 4?)} 31. Bd2 Qc5 {!? A bit of prophylaxis mixed with increased pressure on the f-Rook. ...Re2 is the obvious move, and as far as I can tell it is completely sufficient to win, but after Qg3! White would all of a sudden be threatening a lot of cheap tricks on the h-file and g7 square. There are several lines where White can just sac the f-Rook and mate my King. While Black should be able to avoid that fate with careful play, I figured that this game had already seen enough surprise twists and I wanted to carefully exclude any possibility of a White counterattack before going in for the kill.} 32. Qg3 {Again, with the the idea of a future mating attack based on Qh3+. White is (admirably) not ready to give up while there are still swindling chances.} Re8e5 {Against Qh3+. ...Kg8 would be just as good, but I liked having the option of taking control of the h-file myself with Rh5. The obvious ...Re2 is not losing, but after 33 Qh3+ Qh5 or 33 Qh3+ Kg8 34 Qh6 Qf8 White can lessen the force of Black's attack somewhat by trading Queens. Avoiding exchanges in this position allows a quick win due to Black's overwhelming piece activity.} 33. Kg1 Re4e2 {At last! This move is even more powerful after being delayed for two turns. My opponent resigned here, as there is no answer to both …Rxd2 (followed by ...Rg5 if necessary) and, if the Bishop moves, …Re8+, mating.  I found this in incredibly instructive game for both of us – a lesson on how much patience and care is necessary to conduct a successful attack against an alert opponent, and most importantly a reminder that even some of the most desperate-looking positions hide a whole mess of incredible hidden resources. It ain't over 'til it's over!}
