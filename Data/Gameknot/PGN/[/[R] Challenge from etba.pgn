1. Nf3 Nf6 2. d4 d5 3. c4 Bf5 4. Nc3 c6 {And again you manage to play your 1st four moves in one of the accepted normal openings of chess. Paul Blum, that weird guy with a 629 rating that I played a few weeks ago, makes mistakes taking him out of accepted openings on the 2nd or 3rd move in every game he plays.  Your intuitive grasp of good opening moves is impressive.  Incidentally, this is the Slav Variation (the precise one that he erroneously thought that he was playing against me).  The slav is solid and fine for black and your instincts about how to develop your pieces in this opening are good - though once I start pressuring you had a hard time finding the optimal responses.} 5. Qb3 Qb6 {Qc7 might have been better here in this game, but often in many positions the move you made is a good one.} 6. Qxb6 axb6 7. cxd5 cxd5 {This was the problem with Qb6 in this particular game - you now have doubled pawns on the b file with none on the a or c.  Those pawns will be very difficult to defend because they can't be supported by other pawns.  So that's a weakness, but your position is still fine here.  your pieces will have a lot of scope.} 8. Bf4 Nc6 9. Bc7 e6 10. Bxb6 Bb4 {A good move!} 11. Nd2 {If I didn't play this move, you could have played Ne4 and there would have been some trouble for me.} O-O {Here Nd7 may have been a good move instead.  Notice that my d4 pawn is only protected by my bishop on b6 - and that bishop is in kind of a fragile place, with not a lot of safe escape squares. I know its tempting to castle as soon as you can for safety, but if there is no immediate danger (and there wasn't, in this position), you want to look and see if there isn't something more aggressive that you can do.} 12. e3 Ne4 {This was a good move!} 13. Ndxe4 dxe4 {But this one wasn't as good, to follow it up.  You should capture with the bishop here.  Note that my knight on c3 is still pinned by your bishop, so I wouldn't be able to take the bishop.  By capturing with the pawn, you foul up your pawn structure and make it more difficult to establish a stable defensive structure.} 14. Be2 Ne7 15. O-O Nd5 {Two good moves in a row!  You took your knight from a sort of passive square and brought it to a fairly good one - not to mention that I can't trade it off because then I'd be allowing you to fix your pawn structure problem.} 16. Bc5 Bxc5 17. Nxd5 Bd6 18. Nb6 Rad8 19. g4 Bg6 20. h4 f5 21. g5 Bc7 {Threatening a piece always seems like a sensible move when you're starting out in chess if you can't think of anything better to do.  This isn't a particularly bad move, but it isn't really a good one either.  My knight isn't doing a ton from that square, and by attacking it you just chase it towards better squares.  Even at my level I make this mistake - can't think of what to do so I attack a piece, and it just gets to somewhere better than where it was.  Its a real difficult habit to unlearn, because it is so intuitive. In this position I might have just played e5 right away, which you played later.} 22. Na4 f4 {Not a bad idea.  Fouls up my pawn structure if I capture, leaving my d pawn unprotected and my f pawn backwards and weak.} 23. Bc4 Bf5 24. Nc5 Rfe8 {A tough situation.  I'm going to win either your e pawn or b pawn.  Maybe its a bit better here to save the b pawn because after its gone my a and b pawns have nothing blocking them - they are "connected, passed pawns" in chess terminology.  Connected because they are on adjacent files and can thus protect each other on their way up the board.  Passed because there are no other pawns in their way so their progress is very difficult to stop.} 25. Nxb7 Rdb8 26. Nc5 Bh3 {An interesting idea.  not maybe the optimal square for the bishop, but it could be dangerous in some possible future situations.   Taking my b pawn with your rook should have been a strong candidate for your move.   Every time its your move, you should see if you can take one of my pieces without my having recourse.  The b2 pawn is unguarded so you could have captured it.  however, I would have then played Bb3, and your rook is stuck on the 2nd rank.  It probably won't get captured, but it will be cramped.  So I don't really know if the capture was a good idea or not.  Maybe, maybe not.  Point is, these are the things you should have been thinking about.} 27. Rfb1 Kh8 28. b4 e5 {Another good idea, to eliminate your pawn structure weakness and avoid my attacks on that square.  This was a good move that I did not foresee.} 29. d5 Red8 30. Na6 {sure, this is too bad for you because trades are good for me as long as I'm ahead.  But it isn't catastrophic.  You have 2 central pawns on dark squares right now so your bishop has limited scope and that knight has been jumping around everywhere causing trouble.  So this trade is not that terrible for you.  But if you were worried about it, you could have moved one of those pieces a few moves earlier.} Rbc8 31. Nxc7 {}
