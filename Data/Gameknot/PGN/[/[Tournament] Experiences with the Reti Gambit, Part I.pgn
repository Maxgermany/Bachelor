[Opening "French (C00), Reti (Spielmann) variation"]

1. e4 {"Best by test." -- Bobby Fischer I guess I'll stick to that simple and logical first move for quite the rest of my life, though the Bird (1. f4) or even crazy openings like the Orangutan (1. b4!?) or the Grob attack (1. g4!?) are pretty interesting too and could be great surprise weapons, at least in Blitz.} e6 {The passive but sound French defence, consisting of tons of theory. The usual continuation here is the logical 2. d4 d5, when White has already at least four common choices to proceed (Main Line 3. Nc3, Advance Variation 3. e5, Tarrasch Variation 3. Nd2, Exchange Variation 3. exd5). Ignoring the logical central pawn move, I was really looking forward to the rest of the game at this point, because it was the first time I could use a rare Anti-French opening weapon in tournament play. It's called the...} 2. b3 {... Reti-Gambit! Well it's not a gambit at this point as there are still all pawns alive, but the usual continuation leads White to the possibility of sacrificing a pawn.} d5 {Challenging the center, quite a logic move in regards of the previous 1... e6.} 3. Bb2 {White ignores his attacked central pawn and just proceeds with quick development. You can see that the bishop is quite strong on this place here, already eyeing g7.} dxe4 {Black accepts the gambit (a healthy decision, however like in all gambits, you have to be careful), now the fun begins!} 4. Nc3 {Another development move, which immediately attacks the lost pawn.} Nf6 {Black gets his first minor piece out and defends the won pawn.} 5. Qe2 {The fight against the e4 pawn continues. This move might look odd because it blocks the bishop, but a central idea in the Reti Gambit is queen-side castling, for occupying the d-file, and the light-squared bishop can simply be developed via g2 or h3 afterwards.} Bb4 {Black develops and obviously plans to kill one attacker of the e4 square to hold the gambit pawn.} 6. O-O-O {In the spirit of the gambit, White just continues developing. It can never hurt to place a rook on the same file than the opponent's queen ;-) Notice that winning back the pawn via 6. Nxe4?? fails due to 6... Nxe4 7. Qxe4 Qxd2 mate.} Bxc3 {?! I was very surprised by this move and consider it as weak, because it allows White to open up the d-file and gives away the pair of bishops. It's primary the opponents greed about holding this won pawn which motivates this move, I guess.} 7. dxc3 {Doubled pawns and the temporary blocked dark-squared bishop are the price for the mighty open d-file.} Qe7 {Facing the rook, the queen has to move (or as an alternative, get pinned), of course.} 8. g4 {Occupying space on the king-side and preparing to develop the light-squared bishop. A later advance to g5, attacking the knight, could also be useful. This was the reason I preferred g4 over g3.} h6 {The opponent already seems to fear the pawn advance, because it would leave the pawn on e4 undefended.} 9. Bg2 {So the second bishop is on the long diagonal as-well and the recapturing possibility of the gambit pawn is again on (though it would give away the pair of bishops).} e5 {Freeing the bishop, hoping for simple tactics 10... Bxg4!} 10. h3 {Maybe winning back the pawn with 10. Bxe4 Bxg4 11. Bf3 would even have been a sound possibility, however I didn't want to corrupt my pawn structure and this way the mobility of Black's bishop is also limited.} Bd7 {Develops, but also sets up a trap, in case White takes the pawn. 11. Bxe4?? fails due to 11... Nxe4 12. Qxe4 Bc6!, setting up an X-ray attack, winning the rook.} 11. f3 {"The knight wants to be developed, so please take me!"} exf3 12. Nxf3 {I was quite satisfied with my position at this point, realizing that I'm ahead in development and Black probably won't hold the pawn. The power of the two bishops on the long diagonals will also unfold soon!} Nc6 {Logical, Black prepares to queen-side castle too and wants to defend his pawn.} 13. c4 {Bringing the dark-squared bishop into play again, increasing the pressure on e5.} O-O-O {Black finally gets his king to a safe place.} 14. Rhe1 {Increasing the pressure on the half-open e-file. The poor pawn on e5 is attacked four times, but only defended twice.} Rhe8 15. Nxe5 {It was time to win back the pawn and unfold the power of the bishops. At this point I already saw that I could probably later corrupt Black's king-side pawn structure by taking the knight on f6, heading for an endgame advantage.} Nxe5 16. Qxe5 {Let's simplify the situation by trading of some heavy pieces...} Qxe5 17. Rxe5 Rxe5 18. Bxe5 {Due to the open position, Whites pair of bishops clearly have a huge advantage over Black's minor pieces.} Re8 {? One defender of the bishop is missing now, which enables simple pawn-winning tactics.} 19. Bxf6 {! Another defender of the bishop is killed now, and Black's pawn structure is corrupted, as it was already planned before.} gxf6 20. Bxb7+ {The only tactical trick I used in the game, winning a single pawn. However, in addition to the other advantage of the better pawn structure, it is enough for an easy win.} Kxb7 21. Rxd7 {Now White's rook is on the powerful 7th rank too (I guess 20... Kd8 would have lasted longer, for that reason), already attacking a pawn, Black is dead lost.} Rf8 {While Black is in defending mode...} 22. Kd2 {... White can calmly bring his king into the action.} Kc6 23. Rd5 {Being banished from the 7th rank, the rook finds another nice place, where it also cuts off the Black king from the action.} Rg8 {Intending Rg5, hoping for a resolution of the doubled pawns?} 24. Ke3 Kb6 {That move seemed random for me.} 25. Kf4 c6 26. Rd7 {Home, sweet home!} Rg7 27. Kf5 {It doesn't need great skills to attack that weak pawn structure.} Rg5+ {Out of desperation...} 28. Kxf6 Rg6+ 29. Kxf7 Rg5 30. Kf6 a5 31. Rh7 Rc5 32. Rxh6 Kc7 33. g5 {Oh when the pawns go marchin' in...} Kd7 34. g6 Ke8 35. g7 {And the opponent resigned, accepting that the pawn can't be stopped from queening.}
