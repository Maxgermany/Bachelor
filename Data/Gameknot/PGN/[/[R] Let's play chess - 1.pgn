1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Straight-up Queen's Gambit.} dxc4 3. Nc3 Bd7 {Black can't actually hold on to the gambit pawn.  It's usually worse to try because White normally regains it under favorable circumstances.} 4. a4 e6 5. e3 Nf6 6. Bxc4 {White gets back the pawn.} Bc6 {Although this threatens the g2 pawn, the threat is easily met with normal development.  c6 is not a great square for the B and it wastes a tempo.} 7. Nf3 Bb4 8. O-O Bxc3 9. bxc3 O-O 10. Qe2 Qd7 11. Ne5 {White gets the N to a good square with the gain of a tempo.} Qe8 12. Ba3 {The R is trapped.} Bxa4 13. Bxf8 Kxf8 14. Qa2 Bc6 15. Bd3 Be4 16. Rfb1 {Black's development is lagging because of the loss of time earlier.} b6 17. Bxe4 Nxe4 18. c4 {Nc3 for Black looks like it forks the Q and R, but after Qa3+ the N is lost.} c5 {This blocks the check.} 19. Qc2 f5 20. f3 {f3 kicks the N from a good square.  Note that Black cannot kick White's N with a pawn after playing f5.} Nd6 21. Rxb6 {Sneaking another pawn.} axb6 22. Rxa8 {This also wins the N, which Black realizes too late.} Qc8 23. Rxb8 {If Qxb2, Nd7+ wins the Q.} Qxb8 {Black resigned right after this capture when they realized Nd7 would be crushing.}
