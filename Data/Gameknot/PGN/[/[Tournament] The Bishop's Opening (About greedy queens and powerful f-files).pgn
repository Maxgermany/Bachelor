[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {"Best by test." -- Bobby Fischer} e5 2. Bc4 {The bishop's game, my new beloved opening against open games for almost a year now. While there's not tons of theory to learn, it's perfectly solid and playable, though not seen in top level chess anymore. After the usual 2. Nf3, Black still can choose between a variety of openings (...Nc6, ...Nf6, ...d6) where White has to be prepared. The bishop's opening often transposes to King's Bishop's gambit (1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4), a very fun opening but one that is, directly played, too dangerous for me in tournament play. Also there is an affinity to the Vienna game (1. e4 e5 2. Nc3).} Nf6 {The usual response called "Berlin Defense", developing and attacking the pawn.} 3. d3 {Solid, simple. Interesting to mention here is the existence of the sharp Urusov gambit 3. d4.} h6 {?! preventing Bg5, but losing tempo for development} 4. Nc3 {Continuing to develop; I prefer Nc3 over Nf3 in this position as it keeps open a possible f4 pawn thrust (in the spirit of King's Gambit and the Vienna game).} Bc5 {Completing king's side development and preparing to castle.} 5. Be3 {!? Offering a bishop exchange with the idea of opening the f-file (my favourite file ;-)) and strengthening the centre with another pawn. } Bxe3 {Interestingly enough, Black accepts the offer. I would have expected ...Bb6, himself offering an exchange again for opening the a-file.} 6. fxe3 {I was happy with this position, though being aware that the pawn e3 is a potential weakness -- for having an open file, that's okay.} d6 {Freeing the light-squared bishop.} 7. Nf3 {Completes piece development} c6 {I was wondering why Black, already behind in development, is wasting time with another pawn move. Not thinking further about it, I quickly...} 8. O-O {...castled and herewith occupied the open file with the rook.} Qb6 {Damn, I overlooked this simple double attack tactics which obviously tries to win a pawn and already exploits the backwards pawn weakness! As I am far ahead in development, it isn't that bad, but still a decision has to be made: Save the pawns or sacrifice one and continue with the own plans?} 9. Qd2 {I decided for not caring about a lost pawn, as Black loses only more time with this and even opens me another file. It isn't healthy to go for pawn-eating with the queen in the early development stage, is an important rule in chess, why should the opponent be able to break this rule? The rooks are already connected and development is completed, it takes Black at least three more moves to achieve this! The other option would have been Qc1 which defends both pawns, but then ...Ng4 Re1 results in a cramped position.} Qxb2 {A critical position, now White has to be quick in pushing his agenda to not being left with a pawn less in the end!} 10. d4 {As all pieces have already good positions, it's time to crack up the center. Rab1 before would have also been possible, is maybe even more precise.} exd4 11. exd4 {Obviously, White wants to continue with e5, driving away the knight in turn to exploit the weak f7 point.} Qb4 {Attacks my bishop and pins the knight -- though the pin can't be directly exploited in this case (not even after castling), as ...Nxe4 Nxe4 results in a position where the queen is defended.} 12. Bb3 {This bishop has reached it's dream spot and will not move anymore for the rest of the game ;-) Bxf7+ was very tempting at this point, following with e5 and using the open f-file, but I wasn't sure if it would really work out.} O-O {Finally, Black gets his king into safety.} 13. Rab1 {Occupying the file with tempo, as this threatens the simple Bxf7+ following a queen loss for white.} Qa5 14. e5 {That seemed to be the only move that makes sense in this position, further opening up the centre. I'm not sure whether White really is better in this position, I guess with precise play Black can defend and catch up in development?!} dxe5 {Take with pawn or knight, that is the question now...} 15. dxe5 {I found this move to be more dynamic (opens d-file and drives away the knight), though it creates a pawn structure weakness in form of an isolated pawn.} Ng4 {Somehow I have overlooked that with this move, the pawn is hanging... the rook has to come to help} 16. Rbe1 {At this point, only at move 16, we both have already consumed approx. 1 hour of our time! Obviously, White wants to continue with h3, winning a piece.} Be6 {The second move which surprised me, I overlooked that Black can simply enforce an exchange of bishops! Now Bxe6 fxe6, h3 was the first tactic which came to my mind, but this doesn't work out since ...Rd8 drives my queen away and allows my knight on c3 to be taken. Instead I tried to prevent the exchange with...} 17. Re4 {...this interesting move! If Black takes my bishop, I can simply take the knight with the following threat of Qxh6. The second important purpose of this move is to make space for the queen to leave the d-file, where she can still defend the knight on c3 (on e1).} Rd8 18. Qe1 {White's threat is now Bishop exchange, following Rxg4.} Qb6+ {A check in-between, unexpected but not having any unpleasing consequences.} 19. Kh1 Bf5 {? Black should definitely have taken my bishop here to get rid of one of my best pieces, incessantly eyeing the weak f7 point.} 20. Na4 {Driving the queen away from the a7/g1 diagonal, for preparing Rf4 without letting ...Ne3 happen. Bxf7+! would have probably been stronger, following with Na4 if the king takes.} Qa6 {Okay, after Rf4, ...Ne3 is still possible now, since a following Qxe3 would result in ...Qxf1+. But anyway, why not giving away the Exchange for an awesome position?} 21. Rf4 Ne3 22. Qxe3 {Happily giving away the back-rank rook, knowing that I will soon get another piece for it.} Qxf1+ 23. Ng1 {The queen has to leave again, and the bishop is eaten on the next move, with huge pressure on f7.} Qb5 24. Rxf5 Rf8 {This rook is doomed to passivity now.} 25. Qf2 {Increasing the pressure on the f-file and defending the rook, enabling the covered queen attack e6.} Na6 26. e6 {Again, poor queen has to move.} Qb4 27. exf7+ {This pawn is like a rock (if Black is not able to catch the bishop with the knight or wants to give away material) and will prove to be VERY useful in the rest of the game.} Kh8 28. Nb2 {The knight needs to get back into the game.} Qc3 29. Nd3 Rad8 30. h3 {Not sure if this was really necessary already (I was worrying the queen check on a1), either Qxa7 or the fork threatening Ne5 would have been stronger probably.} Rd6 31. Ne5 {This should have happened one move earlier!} b6 {Black is worried about losing pawns...} 32. Ne2 {Getting the other knight into the action as well. } Qa1+ 33. Kh2 g6 {I was truly shocked and paralysed by this move -- another one which I have completely overlooked! It looks as like White is losing a piece by force now: The rook is obviously attacked by the pawn and has to move along the f-file, but then this leaves the knight on e5 undefended and the queen can happily eat it. Already thinking about to resign, I luckily found the saving move.} 34. Qg3 {That's funny: Black can't open the g-file now as this would immediately result in a mate in two, through a quick queen-sacrifice-and-rebirth (Qg8+ Rxg8 fxg8=D#). The bishop is proving to be extremely effective for White, Black would have better exchanged it!} Kh7 {Protects the pawn on g6 which is attacked twice by White now.} 35. Nf4 {Thrice! Notice that eating the rook is still not possible for Black.} g5 {Trying to keep the files closed. At this point of the game we both had only a few minutes left (before the 40 moves boundary) and had to move rather quickly.} 36. Nh5 {The safe way to play it -- the rook sacrifice Rxg5! had clearly to be considered, as it looks like after ...hxg5, Qxg5 there is no way to avoid mate anymore for Black, but being in time pressure I wasn't 100% sure if it really works out, so I decided to move the knight.} Rd1 {Black gets up hist last resources and threatens mate.} 37. Nf6+ {Just trying to get quickly closer to the 40 moves boundary with a forcing move...} Kh8 38. Qf2 {The good-looking fork Ng6+ would indeed lose a piece: ...Kg7 and after White notices that the mating thread is still present and opens up space for the king, Black eats the knight ...Kxg6} Rh1+ 39. Kg3 {Phew, only one move left and the time pressure is over, finally.} Qc3+ 40. Nd3 Rd1 {Setting up a small trap.} 41. Ne4 {if Nd7, then ...Rxd3+ cxd3, Qxd3+ following Qxd7 gets two pieces and a pawn for a rook (though still not bad for White I guess, positionally speaking)} Qg7 {I wasn't sure how to continue now to convert this obviously promising position into a quick win. Attacking the rook and repositioning the queen for a possible Qg4/Qh5 couldn't hurt.} 42. Qf3 Rh1 43. Rf6 {With the idea of following with Qh5 and hitting on h6. Another plan that came to my mind was getting the rook on e8 with Re5, however this can be easily prevented by Black with Nc7.} Nc5 {(?) Black exchanges this defending piece and loses a pawn.} 44. Ndxc5 bxc5 45. Nxc5 {This knight now has two winning places to go: e6 and d7.} g4 {!? Another move which I wasn't prepared of, attacking my queen. Looks like it has to move away and Black then has a discovered check ...gxh3+, but again, like before in move 34, the rook doesn't need defence, as the queen-sac-and-rebirth trick is still going on on g7. So I can offer to exchange queens.} 46. Qxg4 Qxg4+ 47. Kxg4 {Having this clear advantage in material (2 pawns and 2 pieces for a rook), plus a passed pawn on the 7th rank which can't be eliminated without further loss of material, Whites win is ensured.} Kg7 48. Rxc6 {And Black resigned.}
