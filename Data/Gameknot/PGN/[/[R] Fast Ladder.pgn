1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Bg5 {I'm not sure why I played 3. Bg5 so early as here but I guess sometimes I like to try out other move orders as an experiment} Be7 {I suspect this is weaker than 3. ... Bb4+ as the pin is not particularly dangerous at this time} 4. e3 d5 5. Nc3 Ne4 {A second move with the Knight forces me to be trade dark square Bishops but I've found that is usually good for White in the QGD.} 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. Nxe4 {Now if Black recaptures he has doubled pawns and White a good strong center} O-O {My opponent gets his moves out of sequence here. I'm guessing thinking that the game is currently even rather than being down a piece.} 8. Nc3 Qb4 {Without the dark square Bishop this is an impotent threat easily refuted} 9. Qb3 Qxb3 {Up a piece I'm not hesitant to trade Queens but Black's alternatives were not good. A retreat of the Queen leaves his b-pawn weak and pins the Bishop in place for at least a move or two.} 10. axb3 dxc4 {Now Black allows me to get my pawn structure in order in addition to total dominance of the center and a piece to the advantage. I think 10. ... Nc6 is better} 11. bxc4 Nc6 12. Nf3 Bd7 13. Bd3 Rad8 {Black is trying to activate his pieces but he has one less and a cramped position because of my strong center} 14. O-O Nb4 {An attempt at being active.} 15. Bb1 {I've been watching some of GM games and am less afraid of moves like this now. I didn't want to trade off my Bishop with something like 15. Rfd1 Nxd3 16. Rxd3. This keeps my Bishop on the potential dangerous b1-h7 diagonal but also makes the a2-g8 diagonal an option down the road.} Bc6 {Again playing actively hoping to double my pawns and weaken my Kingside structure} 16. Ne5 {But, my Knight has a very nice square and now I'm attacking both the Bishop and the dangling a-pawn} f6 {This move is probably the worst choice as it does not deal with either of the threats. The only safe square for the Bishop is e8 and my opponent likely did not want to disconnect his rooks but this doubles his pawns and loses a pawn as well. Probably better was either 16. ... Be8 or 16. ... a6} 17. Nxc6 Nxc6 18. Nb5 {Down a piece Black must maintain his pawns hoping for a storm at the end of the game to gain a draw but now the pawns are under assault} a6 19. Nxc7 {One gone} Rf7 {Attempting to trap my Knight but there really are no good moves at this stage. 9. ... Rd7 20. c5 is no good. 19. ... e5 20. Ne6 forks the Rooks} 20. Nxe6 {Another pawn} Re8 21. Nc5 Nb4 {Again Black tries to activate but this move essentially traps the Knight as it can only retreat back to the c6 square} 22. Ne4 {Looking at more forks with 23. Nd6} Rd8 23. c5 {My pawn chain is ridiculously strong} f5 24. Nd6 {A spectacular square from which my Knight will be extremely difficult to remove} Rf6 {An empty threat and giving away yet another pawn. 24. ... Rc7 is probably bettter but those Rooks are going to have an almost impossible task in getting past my pawn chain} 25. Nxb7 Rd7 26. Nd6 {Back to the womb as it were} g6 {Even the forward Knight doesn't have any attacking prospects at this stage and Black must feel strangled} 27. Ba2+ {My plan was something like 27. ... Kf8 28. Bc4 Ra7 29. Ra4 Nc6 30. Rfa1 snatching the a-pawn and clearing the way for a storm} Nxa2 {My opponent trades off his attacking Knight} 28. Rxa2 Kf8 {Gives away the a-pawn but after 28. ... Ra7 29. Rfa1 it is gone anyway} 29. Rxa6 Ke7 {While this allows me to trade off one of the Rooks what else does Black really have?} 30. Nc8+ Kf7 31. Rxf6+ Kxf6 32. b4 Rb7 33. Rb1 Rc7 34. Nd6 {Mama, I'm home} h5 35. b5 Ke6 36. b6 {My opponent resigned at this stage as there is no stopping my b-pawn once I get the Rook on the a-file. Best for Black might be trading his Rook for my Knight and a pawn but it is hopeless. This was a methodical win on my part and I was particularly pleased with 15. Bb1 because it is the sort of move I never would have made in the past although I'm not sure it was integral to this victory.}
