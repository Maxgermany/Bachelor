1. e4 {Classic opening.  ------- This is my first annotate. Probably, more wisdom can be taken from comments to movements, then from my notes. I have read other annotations to take some example, but still it is my first. Greetings to my opponent. I had big fun to play with you.} e5 2. d4 {This is my style opening, it's not stable, but really effective for short parties.} Bd6 {I see it as mistake. getting pawn and building position on d4 is better response. Also that this bishop is locked in cage, with nothing-having-to-do pawn on d7. } 3. d5 c6 {Searching for exchange?} 4. Nf3 c5 {No, moving pawn on two times, thank you for dead move! I wouldn't beat him with pawn on d5 to not lost position and keep Bishop dead.} 5. Bc4 {position constructed with pawn on d5} Nf6 6. Bg5 {Pinning his Knight to Queen.} O-O 7. O-O {Silence.} b6 8. Nc3 {Trying attack on Queen side.} Ba6 {this bishop blocked his queen side what I was thankful to. I had no reason to attack it.} 9. Qd3 Qe7 {Queen on dead position. Black has closed themselves.} 10. a3 h6 {Comes the time to attack.} 11. Bxa6 {I prefer to Queen side, it's so powerless} hxg5 {I was happy, better was to kill the other one Bishop to prevent...} 12. Bb7 {...loosing Tower} g4 {Pawn attack, it will come up a few times} 13. Bxa8 {My Knight has nowhere to escape not weakening King hidden in the corner} c4 {After Q:c4 g4:f3 with fainting my defence} 14. Qe2 gxf3 15. Qxf3 {Everything under control, } Bc5 {Now is time to free my Bishop, so he run away alive} 16. Bb7 {Double jump!} d6 17. Bc6 {On safe position...} Nxc6 {...or not.} 18. dxc6 {Old position will no longer be needed, black Bishop is free, time to exchange position on material benefits} Rc8 {Now I thought I can use this attack.} 19. b4 Bd4 {Wise, no more loosing figures or pawns} 20. b5 {Tada! New stronghold some further.} Bxc3 21. Qxc3 {Exchange.} Nxe4 {Killing my pawns, he's getting greedy!} 22. Qe3 d5 {Pawn attack vol 2} 23. f3 Nd6 {Running...} 24. a4 d4 25. Qd2 {... far...} c3 26. Qd3 {...away. still keeping position of Queen} e4 27. fxe4 Nxe4 28. Qxd4 {I'm greedy to.} Rd8 29. Qe3 {Final battle - positions and pawns.} Qb4 30. Rf4 Qb2 {After beating c2 I could lost this easily.} 31. Rc1 {Starts defence.} Nd2 {beautiful} 32. Qe1 {I need tower to finish this game on this position} Rd6 {even this I can't mate him, because of Knight guarding e4. Waiting for his last jump I thought about...} 33. c7 {...my pawn, which traveled so far from d4} Nb3 {Now it came...} 34. c8=Q+ {...time to mate} Kh7 35. Rh4+ Kg6 {Tower on h6 was better idea.} 36. Qe4+ {Qe4+ It was this only one movement that if I couldn't do, I could be lost.} Kf6 37. Qcf5# {And mate.  ---- That's all. I hope you post a few comments by the road, or PM me so I can change a few things to make it better. Thank you for everything and good luck in your GK games!}
