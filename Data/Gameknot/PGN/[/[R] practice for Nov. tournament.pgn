1. e4 {E4, as everybody knows, is the very popular move to start out the chess game. I bet at least 60% of games start with e4. But the most questionable is how to respond to this. There are exactly 20 ways. Some people respond what I call traditionally; e5. But there are other ways that work better for some. He responded c6.} c6 {My guess already is that he will develop mostly on the Queenside. Rated 1822 on the game database, it looks like it will work quite fine.} 2. Nc3 d5 {That was very strong. He simply took over the center in a "piece developing" way.} 3. d3 {What I say, is that this is way too defensive for the 3rd move. It sets up a fairly good opening though.} dxe4 {"Some ways work better for some" as I said on move 1. I Responded the way I would to it. I knew this position would come ever since I did the questionable move, d3. } 4. Nxe4 {This has one or two bad points to it, but I think it is better than the alternative, dxe4. That would sooner make an open file in the center and would leave me with either Nxd1 or Kxd1. Both I don't like. Kastling is a total option. But basically, I did a Caro-Kann opening. An average one.} Bf5 5. Bf4 {This was not one common response. I just thought I could put some pressure through the hole. I was thinking of rather doing Qf3. } Nd7 6. f3 {I could have done a better response, again. I wanted to atleast move my queen there!} e6 {There he goes, making room for his bishop and probably Qh4+ Actually 3 possoble ways. But perhaps e5 was better.} 7. Bd6 {I was forcing a trade with our "soon to be powerful" bishops.} Bxe4 {I lost three points by not doing Bxf8. Another blunder} 8. dxe4 Bxd6 {But What I descovered after move seven was that my queen could invade and it would be a good plan.} 9. Qxd6 Ngf6 10. Rd1 {I soon took over the D file, But it was made so he also had it closed. I needed to break through some how.} Qe7 {Him giving me my break through, I hapily accepted the queen trade.} 11. Qxe7+ Kxe7 12. g3 {I suppose that wasted a move. It gives my bishop some more options of developing though.} Nc5 {He wants to put his rooks on the D file in able to take over} 13. b3 {Maybe to build up my pawns. But I shouldn't have waisted time doing that when my kingside hadn't been accelerated.} Rhd8 {M..hm} 14. Bd3 {My goal in this was to be able to create a trade, ending up a pawn with my rook behind it. It becamea backwards pawn though.} Nxd3+ 15. cxd3 {My idea worked OK} c5 {He was now fighting it.} 16. f4 { Now I was gaining space in the back. It took longer than I hoped, but I got my rooks together. :)} Rd7 {He beats my plan.} 17. Nf3 Rad8 {Without another protection, I would lose a pawn. I could do Ne5, better than what I did, Ke2. Ke2 DOES allow my rook a way through. (On h1.)} 18. Ke2 b5 {?} 19. Rd2 {Doubling up my rooks.} Ne8 {I shall put again: ?} 20. Rhd1 f6 21. e5 Nc7 {I hope he is planning Nd5} 22. d4 {I needed to get on with it. We could spend another 25 moves just settling it, but he would probably win anyways. Another reason to end it.} Nd5 23. Rd2d3 {I needed to defend the future Nc3+}
