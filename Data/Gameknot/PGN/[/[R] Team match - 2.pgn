1. e4 {The main interest I see in this game is the battle for key squares. Black's play is positionally sound, yet not particularly brilliant; White hoped to draw the endgame and was very close to the target...} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {This is the Tarrasch variation. I have annotated another game with it (against piratizii).} Be7 4. Bd3 c5 5. dxc5 Nf6 6. Qe2 O-O 7. Ngf3 a5 {This move discouraged me from attempting a 0-0-0} 8. O-O Na6 9. e5 Nd7 10. c4 {10. Bb5 Naxc5 11. Nd4 f6 12. f4 was better.} Naxc5 11. Bc2 {Remembering the lesson of the game against piratiizi, and allowing eventually a3 without getting forked by the knight.} b6 12. b3 Bb7 13. Bb2 Qc7 14. Rac1 Rfd8 15. Bb1 {Forgetting the lesson against piratizii. This is not necessary. "The threat is stronger than its execution" - wrote Nimzowitch: if the idea is to take d5 uncovering the queen, it will work if the bishop is in c2, since there is check in h7.} Nf8 16. Rfd1 Ng6 17. a3 {The effect: this move was long planned, and now the white squares are weak. With the bishop in c2, Black would not have had this advantage.} dxc4 18. b4 {18. Qxc4 Ba6 19. Qe4 was definitely more active! } axb4 19. axb4 Na4 {The black correctly takes advantage of the weakness of the white squares. Letting Ba6 precede this one would have been even more effective.} 20. Rxc4 {The computer suggests Nxc4. On Rxc4 there is a variation which both players missed: 20. Rxc4 Ba6 21. Rxc7 Bxe2 22. Rdc1 Bxb4 23. Nc4 Bxf3 24. Bxg6 hxg6 25. gxf3 Nxb2 26. Nxb2 Rd2} Qd7 21. Rd4 Qc7 {Nf4!} 22. Rc1 Qb8 23. Nc4 {23. Bxg6 hxg6 24. Ba3 Rxd4 25. Nxd4 was a chance to simplify the position and get some more space.} Nxb2 24. Rxd8+ Qxd8 25. Qxb2 b5 26. Ncd2 Ra4 {White squares...} 27. Qc2 Rxb4 28. g3 Bxf3 {I see this as a strategical turning point. It is the beginning of a sequence of moves leading the Black to enter an endgame with opposed bishops...} 29. Nxf3 Rc4 30. Qb2 Rxc1+ 31. Qxc1 Qb8 32. h4 {I don't remember - nor seem to be able to reconstruct - why I did not play Qb2. I probably thought the Black would not have liked the next moves...} Nxe5 33. Nxe5 Qxe5 {Here we are.} 34. Qc8+ Bf8 35. Bxh7+ Kxh7 36. Qxf8 {... and so I let the possibility of ending up with kings and opposing bishops fade away... now I could only hope for endless checks...} Kg6 37. Qb4 Qd5 {White squares strike back!} 38. Qg4+ Kh7 39. Qf4 e5 40. Qf5+ g6 41. Qb1 Qc4 42. h5 b4 43. hxg6+ fxg6 44. Qd1 Qd4 45. Qb3 {45. Qf3 is rather ineffective considering 45... e4.} Qc3 46. Qf7+ Kh6 47. Qf8+ Kg5 48. Qe7+ Kg4 49. Qe6+ {There the chance goes! The White must confine the king to the side to have chances of draw:  49. Qf6 Qd4 50. Kg2 Kh5 51. f3 Qb2+ 52. Kh3 Qd4 53. Kg2 and now if the Black does not draw, loses after 54. g4+} Kf3 50. Qd5+ Ke2 51. Qe4+ Kd1 {The black king joined his queen in the West, and now all is lost.} 52. Qxg6 b3 53. Qg4+ Kc1 54. Qg5+ Kb2 55. Qg4 Ka3 56. Qe2 b2 57. Qa6+ Kb3 58. Qb5+ Kc2 59. Qe2+ Kb1 60. f3 Qc1+ {I resigned.}
