1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Bb4 3. g3 Bxc3 4. bxc3 c5 5. d4 Qe7 6. Bg2 Nc6 7. Bxc6 bxc6 {Queen side pawns are really piled up on the bishop file.} 8. Nf3 d6 9. Be3 Nf6 10. Qa4 Qc7 11. d5 Bd7 12. Qd1 {White's queen spends a lot of time dancing back and forth between d1 & a4 while black develops his position.} O-O 13. Rb1 Bh3 14. Ng5 Bf5 15. Rb2 Rab8 16. Rd2 Rfd8 17. Qa4 {Again with the queen...} Rb1+ 18. Rd1 Rxd1+ 19. Qxd1 {a4-d1.} Rb8 20. O-O Rb1 21. Qa4 {d1-a4.  She's making me dizzy.} h6 22. Nf3 Rb6 23. Rd1 Nd7 24. Nh4 Bh7 {Ok, Be4 invites Pf3, so I get Bh7...} 25. Bc1 {But Bc1?  What's the plan?} Qb7 26. Nf3 e4 27. Nd2 f5 28. Nb3 Nf6 29. Na5 {White's horse migrates from h4 to a5--five leaps during which black strengthens his position.  All over Pc6?} Ra6 30. dxc6 Qc7 31. Qb5 Rxa5 32. Qb7 Ne8 {QxQ nets black's pawn @ d6, but won't help white promote the c pawn. } 33. Qxc7 Nxc7 34. Rxd6 Ne8 35. Rd8 Kf7 {Black's king will close the gap--Pc6 cannot be saved.} 36. Bf4 {But Bf4 wins the black knight, evening up the score.  White picks up another pawn in the ensuing melee. } Ke7 37. c7 Nxc7 38. Bxc7 Rxa2 39. e3 g5 40. Rh8 Bg6 41. Rxh6 Kf7 42. Rh8 Ke6 43. Rd8 Ra3 44. Rd5 Rxc3 45. Rxc5 Bf7 {Pc4 is doomed.} 46. Bd8 g4 47. Rc7 Bg8 {I didn't get Bg8.  The black bishop was in no danger.  Why not push the a file pawn?} 48. Rxa7 Rxc4 49. Kg2 Rc1 50. Re7+ Kd6 51. h4 Bc4 52. h5 Be2 {Forced mate in two?  I would have at least tried Bc7+.  White drops a bishop in that exchange, if black falls for it, then black's white bishop won't stop Ph.  Be2 make's black's intentions abundantly clear, however.  White's up a pawn, but the writing is on the wall.}
