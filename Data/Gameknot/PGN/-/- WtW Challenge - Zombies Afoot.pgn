1. e4 {Another Walking the Walk game:  Russ20124 (me) playing White vs. Brigadecommander playing Black  White opens with a not so surprising or original King's pawn.  I really enjoyed playing this game. Always fun to be beat up really badly. Please have fun reading this and comment if you'd like... I've tried to add a little humor to a fairly one-sided game. Enjoy!} e6 {seems like a decent opening, expecting d5 next.} 2. Be2 {Now for some reason, I always want to surprise BC when I play her. Trying something different she hasn't already seen. My reasoning (flawed as it is) is that perhaps I can lull her into a sense of over confidence... perhaps enticing her to make some silly move I can capitalize on.   Yea.   The problem is, if she hasn't seen much of it, I've probably seen none of it. Brilliant.  In reality, the move I make typically is the silly one and almost always gets me in more trouble faster than I anticipated. Such is this game - and the previous game (let's just call them practice for this game) - which I did not annotate because of how embarrassing (one 26 moves, the other 9).  The Be2 move above is one I am quite proud of. In fact, with a +0.31 computer calculated advantage, this turns out to be the peak of my game. While annotating this game, I was so thrilled with my performance thus far, I took a picture of it with my iPhone for future reference. Basking in the glory of the bishop opening move.   Take that BC!} d5 {A challenge at the center! Someone else might have folder right here, but I had a +0.31 advantage, what's there to fear?} 3. exd5 {This will show black. I still have a +0.19 advantage, how can I lose?} exd5 {now I have nothing in the center, but her king is exposed. I don't think I've been here before. With nothing else to go on, black has a pawn in the center and white doesn't.. not good for white.} 4. Bf3 {In hindsight, I'm not sure what I was thinking. I think maybe I was trying to threaten the pawn, but already broke one of the opening rules of moving the same piece twice. Sure wish I developed a bit more first.} Nf6 {Which black does} 5. b3 {and then I think of a brilliant plan to try a flank opening. a little late for that, but what the heck. I've always found it extremely helpful to change your strategy in mid opening. That's always worked really well.  Moving Nc3 would've had her chasing my knight around, so probably should have moved Ne2 for castle preparation. Computer agrees, but even then I'm still only -0.99, i still have a really good chance :)  ...oh, how things have changed in the last few moves.} Nc6 {another nice developing move.} 6. Bb2 {there's the flank opening. I do like to position my bishops down the diagonals in the openings. } Bd6 {look at the difference in development. White really has very little center control and black's knights are really well positioned. In addition, white is a move behind in castling. The bishop double move in the opening caught up with me.   At this point, I'm hoping a surprise comet enters the solar system headed to earth. Short of a timeout from a cosmic event, there's really no way I'm winning this game. I relax my previous stretch goal of winning and set my sites on my new "don't lose in 9 moves again" goal.} 7. d4 {the flank thing actually worked a little bit. If only that g knight wasn't in my way I could castle.} O-O {the black knight was not in her way. Black is all setup and ready for action. I better prepare.} 8. Ne2 {better late than never.} Ng4 {I didn't see that coming, not sure why. If I castle now, I lose. I mean, let me rephrase. If I castle now, I lose a lot faster.   what to do, what to do.} 9. Qd2 {I thought maybe I could get ready to castle long.} Re8 {eek! Where'd he come from!?!} 10. Nbc3 {mentally screaming "there's no place like c1, there's no place like c1"} Qh4 {the queen is free.. my time is near.} 11. g3 {but my pawn still has some teeth.} Qf6 {the unprotected bishop. At this point, I've got a sinking feel I may not be castling at all.} 12. Bxg4 {so I remove the pesky knight.} Bxg4 {at least I can castle now! and my pawn is advanced a bit, maybe there's something I can do here.} 13. O-O-O {that looks deceivingly safe.} Bb4 {don't like the white queen lined up white the bishop like that.} 14. Qf4 {my thought is that maybe I can remove one of black's threats from the board. So I fork the c pawn and the queen.} Bxe2 {she didn't bite, but instead threatens the rook.. well two can play that game little missy.} 15. Nxd5 {...except now two pieces are in jeopardy instead of just one.} Qxf4+ {losing the rook no matter what, so maybe I'll pick up one of black's rooks in a fork.} 16. gxf4 {I will regret that later.} Bxd1 {goodbye rook.} 17. Nxc7 {forked the rook after all. small achievable goals is what I prefer.} Bf3 {now I'm thinking maybe, just maybe, if the stars align I could get to 30 moves. } 18. Rg1 Bd6 {look at those bishops... nice.} 19. Nxa8 {have to look at the positive side of things, at least the black rook won't be on the e file anymore.} Bxf4+ {except not.} 20. Kb1 Bxh2 21. Rc1 {hunkered down like those people in the house in that movie "Night of the Living Dead". You know you're going to get eaten by zombies, just want to live a little longer.} h5 {for some reason, which I do not yet see, she doesn't take my knight. Perhaps she feels pity upon it. Perhaps she realizes it poses no threat. Perhaps she got something in her eye and didn't see it.} 22. Nc7 {ha, move that rook!  (small victories, I'll take 'em)} Bxc7 {Oh, that's why she didn't take my knight. } 23. a3 {I have no better move I could think of. Zombies are tearing the roof off the shack.} h4 {yea, I don't really think that's going to be an issue.} 24. d5 {because I have a pawn! yea.. that just happened! woohoo.} Bxd5 {not much left now... I can hear the zombies groaning.} 25. Rg1 {I decide to rush out into the open, arms flailing and crush my opponent with my superior rook skills.} h3 {yea, that's pretty close.  <gulp>} 26. Rxg7+ {take that!} Kf8 {great move.. I mean black really dodged a bullet there.} 27. Rh7 {{move made with guttural laughter} take that!} h2 {and I shall throw myself into the zombie hoard so that my king will not be eaten immediately.} 28. Rxh2 {wait for it...} Bxh2 {tasty rook.} 29. Kc1 {now I'm thinking maybe the king needs to pull up his sleeves and get to work. He has been somewhat quiet. It's clear I'm achieving my 30 move stretch goal, so I have nothing to lose now.} Bf4+ {the end is near.} 30. Kb1 Re1+ {that rook is really not welcome back here... please move.} 31. Ka2 {safe for a moment.} Re2 {very pleasantly moves off the back rank per my request, how nice.} 32. Kb1 {maybe I can hypnotize her into a draw. Maybe she won't notice if we go back and forth three times.} Be4 33. Ka2 {yes, maybe I can hypnotize her... just twice more.} Rxc2 {ummm, no.} 34. a4 {pawn chickens out and makes a run for it.} Be5 {zombies are in the house.} 35. f4 {what the heck, let's see if I can make 40 moves.} Bxb2 {nope.} 36. Kb1 {closing in} Nb4 {closing in.} 37. a5 {pawn chickened out and made a run for it.} Rd2# {the king dies alone.}
