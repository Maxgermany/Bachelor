1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Two years ago, when my rating was in the 1500s I dreamed of getting at the very least an Expert Draw and possibly a win against an Expert.  Ion was the first Expert I played against and boy how green I was!  My very first game against him was Battle of the Wings in which we fought a close rook and pawn ending with Ion's kingside pawn majority closer to promotion than my queenside majority.  I therefore lost that game.  Since then it has been heartache, heartache and more heartache with me making some very silly mistakes in my games against him and there were a couple of games I could have drawn but I blew it big time.  Soon Ion was leading me by a mighty 13 points to ZILCH!  I repeat ZILCH!  Well, it is Zilch no longer and not even Ion can take that half point away from me.  This is happiness!  This game was a brevity (terminated in less than 20 moves but it was a forced draw by perpetual check).  Anyhow, I will start further commentary on move 7 when I played Nc3 in response to Ion's Rf8.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 6. Bb3 Rf8 7. Nc3 {7. Nc3 - a developing move - in fact the Master Mater (Easy19) played this against me in the game At Each Other's Throats which I went on to lose.} Nd4 {7. ...... Nd4 - and I also played this against Freddy.} 8. d3 d6 9. Nd5+ Nxd5 {9. ..... Nxd5 - and I also captured on d5 against Freddy.  Note that in the Gameknot db Ke8 is suggested here.  Hmm, if Ion had played that I had Nxh7 then if Nxh7 then Qh5+ pocketing the knight next move.  A similar thing happened to me in my game against Nuntar, viz:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12791594&fb=1&rnd=0.08891115575838959 so I thought that would be a good way to learn my lesson - lump it on the Coach.  But he crosses my plan with Nxd5.} 10. Bxd5 c6 {10. ...... c6 - I think Freddy recommended this move to me after he recaptured on d5 with his light squared bishop.  I can see why he thought I might have a good game.  I decide on Nxh7 after all because I can see Ion's King and the Wicked Witch of the West lined up nicely on that h5-d8 diagonal for a possible skewer.} 11. Nxh7 cxd5 12. Nxf8 {12. Nxf8 - might as well help myself to that rook.} Kxf8 {12 ....... Kxf8 - why not Qxf8?} 13. c3 {13. c3 - an attempt to drive the knight off so I can put Glenda on f3 with check but Ion has something up his sleeve.} Bg4 14. Qxg4 {14. Qxg4 - I think f3 fails to Qh5+.  I can see that Ion has a fork on c2 but at least Glenda moves on to an aggressive square.  Glenda is gadding about just that little bit more on that broomstick - watch out!} Nc2+ 15. Kd1 {15. Kd1 - this was put in as a conditional move.  Henry makes room for me to get my KR into play and if Ion should swipe the rook on a1 with the knight then that horsie could get itself trapped.} Nxa1 16. Bg5 {16. Bg5 - develops with a threat to the Wicked Witch.  Now where is that witch going?  I expected Qc7 preparing a block against Glenda's check on f5.} Qa5 {16. ...... Qa5 - This move attacks the pawn on a2 and will defend that wretched horsie on a1.  However I now condemn Ion to a Low Draw by Perpetual Check as follows:- Variation A 17. Qf5+ Ke8 18. Qe6+ Kf8 19. Qf5+ Kg8 20. Qe6+ Kh7 21. Qf5+ Kh8 22. Qh3+ Kg8 23. Qe6+ If he tries to duck it here is:- Variation B 17. Qf5+ Kg8 18. Qe6+ Kh7 19. Qf5+ g6 20. Qf7+ Kh8 21. Bf6#.  Commiserations and bad luck Ion.  Do you the Inquest Jury suggest a better alternative to Qa5 - I suggested Qc7 - do you the Jury agree?  I now play Ion as black and I think I will need to play out of my skin to avoid a backlash!  Anyhow, time for some sweet dreams.  Bye for now - Joanne} 17. Qf5+ {}
