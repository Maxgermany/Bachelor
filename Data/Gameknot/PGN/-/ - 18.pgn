1. Nc3 Nf6 2. Nf3 {I always start off with my knights leading the way.} d5 3. d3 d4 4. Nb5 Bd7 5. a4 a6 6. Nbxd4 c5 7. Nb3 e6 8. Nxc5 {I usually don't use knights, but this is too easy.} Bxc5 9. d4 Bc6 10. dxc5 {to me, bishops are more valuable than knights.} b5 11. b3 Ne4 12. Ne5 Nc3 13. Qd3 Nd5 14. Nxc6 Nxc6 15. axb5 Ncb4 16. Qd2 a5 17. c3 h6 18. cxb4 {I played to win, not to not lose as you can easily tell here.} Nxb4 19. g3 O-O {aww castling} 20. Bg2 Rb8 21. b6 Qxd2+ 22. Bxd2 g5 23. Rxa5 {it's over now.} Nc6 24. Bxc6 Rbc8 25. Bd7 Rcd8 26. b7 Rxd7 {Take it, you just lost a move with a piece that I don't need.} 27. c6 Rc7 28. Ra6 f6 29. Ba5 Rcf7 30. Ra8 f5 31. c7 f4 32. b8=Q fxg3 {you just lost another move for a pawn... A PAWN!!} 33. c8=Q {This is pretty scary right here.} gxf2+ 34. Kf1 Kg7 35. Qcxf8+ Kg6 36. Ra7 Rf6 37. Qbe8+ Kf5 38. Qef7 {As you can tell, I'm just fooling around here, because I know that I pretty much won.  My one Rook doesn't even move at all in the whole game.} Rxf7 39. Qxf7+ Ke5 40. Kxf2 Kd6 41. Rd1+ {Okay, never mind.  I do use it.  Actually, it's the last piece that I do move.  This is game right here.} Kc5 42. Qxe6 Kb5 43. Rd5# {Checkmate.  This was against a very good chessplayer.  He was probably just having an off-game.  I tend to have a lot of those.}
