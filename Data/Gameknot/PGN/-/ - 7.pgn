[Opening "Two knights defence (C55)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Easy development of Giuoco Piano. I used this opening cause i knew he lost much games in this way.} 4. b3 h6 5. d3 d5 {now he decides to push d3-d5. i don't like this move (d6 seems a little better).} 6. exd5 {So, I capture d pawn and the battle begin!} Nxd5 7. Bxd5 Qxd5 {6......N:d5 7.B:d5, Q:d5. Luckily I have the f3 night so the queen can't move d4 and the rook on b1.} 8. c4 Qe6 9. Qe2 Bb4+ {8.c4... Qe6 9.Qe2...Bb4 } 10. Bd2 {Bischop d2} Bxd2+ 11. Nbxd2 {10...B:d2 11.Nb:d2} O-O 12. O-O-O {Castles} Re8 13. h3 Nd4 {12...Re8 13.h3 ...Nd4?!} 14. Nxd4 exd4 {I take his Night and he takes mine with e:d4. Now the queens are face to face!} 15. Qxe6 fxe6 {I thought the best move was take the queen and i did it. But he takes my queen with his pawn (?).} 16. Rhe1 c5 17. Re4 b6 18. f4 {16. Rhe1... c5 17.Re4... b6 18. f4. I develop the right rook and ama49 develops his left pawns.} Bb7 {His bishop wants my rook!} 19. Re2 {Rook e2 but now i can't push g pawn cause then Bf3 and my opponent takes one of my rooks, so i gotta be careful.} Re7 20. Rg1 {19... Re7 20.Rg1 and my rooks are in safe.} Rf8 21. g3 g6 22. h4 h5 23. a4 a5 {20...Rf8 21. g3...g6 22.h4...h5 23.a4...a5. Pawn are still in development.} 24. Ne4 {Now i offer him my Night for his bishop and} Bxe4 {he accepts} 25. Rxe4 Kg7 26. g4 hxg4 27. Rxg4 {25.R:e4...Kg7 26.g4...h:g4 27.R:g4. Now the g6 pawn is blocked to capture other pieces so, i think for the next move h5 and I earn the g pawn, but.......} Rf5 {Rf5! great move by ama49, even if it was the only good move possible....} 28. Re5 Rxe5 29. fxe5 {28.Re5...R:e5 29.f:e5} Rf7 {Now he wanna move Rf3 or Rf1 check. But i can protect the pawns with Kd2 so i move Rg1} 30. Rg1 Rf3 31. Kd2 Rh3 {30...Rf3 like i thought 31.Kd2... Rh3} 32. Rg4 Kh6 33. Ke2 Kh5 {32.Rg4...Kh6 33.ke2... Kh5} 34. Rg5+ {Rg5 } Kxh4 35. Rxg6 {He makes a big mistake: 34...K:h4 35.R:g6} Rg3 {he tries to "corrupt" me with his rook, but...} 36. Rxe6 {i take his e pawn} Rg5 37. Kf3 Rg3+ 38. Ke4 Rg4+ 39. Kd5 Rg3 {36...Rg5 37.Kf3... Rg3  38.Ke4... Rg4  39.Kd5... Rg3 and he tries to catch d3 pawn, but i try to catch b pawn too, so....} 40. Rxb6 Rxd3 41. e6 {it happens and now I'm for promoting.} Re3 42. Kxc5 d3 43. Rd6 Kg5 44. Kd4 {41... Re3 42.K:c5... d3 43.Rd6... Kg5 44.Kd4 and he has to leave the pawn.} Rf3 45. Ke4 Rh3 46. Rxd3 Rh8 {i capture the pawn and the game goes on.} 47. e7 Kf6 48. Rd5 Ra8 49. c5 {I leave the e pawn to promote the others.} Kxe7 50. c6 Rc8 51. Rxa5 Rxc6 {ahahahah now i MUST won} 52. Kd4 Kd6 53. b4 Kc7 54. Rc5 Kb6 {Now i capture his rook} 55. Rxc6+ Kxc6 56. a5 Kb5 57. Kd5 Ka6 58. Kc6 Ka7 59. b5 Kb8 60. a6 Ka7 61. b6+ {in this moment i have to be careful to the stalemate} Ka8 62. b7+ Kb8 63. a7+ Kxa7 64. Kc7 {The game is over. The promotions and the mate in 3 is inevitable and black resigned!!!! I WON!!!!!!!}
