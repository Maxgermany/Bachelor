1. e4 a6 {Opening with Kings Pawn. A noncommital first move from Freddy leaving me guessing as to which opening he is planning on playing} 2. d4 {If he's leaving the center open, I'm going to play for it} c5 3. Nf3 {Freddy opting for a gambit. I decided to develop and try to hold onto the center control rather than give up a pawn for center position (holding onto the pawn wouldn't have been possible in any case)} cxd4 4. Nxd4 {exchanging pawns} e5 5. Nf3 {kicking my knight back to f3} Nf6 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bd2 O-O 8. Bc4 d6 9. Bd5 Nc6 10. O-O {Both sides castled kingside. Freddy mentioned we're off to the middlegame, am I ready? Evidently I was not} Bxc3 11. Bxc3 {black opting to sxchange his DSB for my knight} Ne7 12. Bb4 {Why? I cannot tell you now. But not a pleasant square for the DSB. It is not as though the pawn on d6 is going anywhere anytime soon.} a5 {Allowing Freddy to attack. At this point in time I was under pressure. Retreating to a3 would let him suffocate my bishop via b7-b5 after taking care of my LSB} 13. Bxd6 {so, attack is the best form of defence?} Nfxd5 {Not in this case. I misread the exchange order and I've gone a piece down.} 14. Bxe7 Nxe7 15. Qe2 {Avoiding the exchange of queens. Being down in material and not wanting to give up the open d-file after the exchange} Ng6 16. Rfd1 {trying to budge his queen and lay claim to the d-file} Qb6 17. b3 {preventing Qxb2. that said, with this position I don't think that would have been an option for black. ...Qxb2 Rd-b1 probably cramps down space for black's queen} a4 18. Nd2 {I didn't want to take and allow Freddy's rook to jump directly into the game} Nf4 19. Qc4 {got to move the queen, but the knight on f4 is looking very pesky indeed} Bh3 {The point in time when you know the end is near. Freddy's comment "whoops"... of course. Qg6+ is the obvious move follwing gxh3, which allows him to harrass my king. But I couldn't see how this led to mate. Ignoring the sacrifice didn't seem an entertaining option either, g3 didn't look like it would bring me far after the queen swung by kingside. Freddy's comment after telling him that I couldn't see how the sarifice would lead to mate? "watch and learn"} 20. gxh3 {And because one shouldn't die wondering... gxh3. *grabs popcorn*} Qg6+ {as expected} 21. Kf1 {the only option. I figured black would be playing: Qg2+, Ke2, Nxh3 looking for ... Qxf2, but Nxh3 would still give me time to bring back my queen to guard f2} Rac8 {Aaah! the only safe squares for my queen are taking her away from the action, and by moving her I'm giving up c2.} 22. Qb5 {still keeping the possibilty of Qe2 alive if I need to protect against ... Qxf2 after Nxh3} Rxc2 {got to be careful now, losing the knight means no protection of e4 and mate in Qxe4 Qh1 (or Qg2 if I go for Kg1) } 23. Qxe5 {Ha! material advantage +1! XD But back to reality, I desperately needed to put my Q back in action, and here she can add protection to e4 and threaten the black knight on f2. This forces black to act with decision, but I can still escape the mate on f2} Qg2+ {starting the charge} 24. Ke1 {forced} Qg1+ {but now, with my queen guarding e4 I can move my knight can't I? except that no, Qxf2++} 25. Nf1 Qxf2# {and that folks, is all. Many thanks Freddy for challenging me and the masterclass in attack. I was quite disappointed at having given up material so early, but plenty of stuff for reflection and study in these 25 moves}
