1. e4 {Mistee is challenged to a game by Easy19 (wonder what his name means?) Mistee plays white and moves her normal e4.} h6 {Mr. 19 surprises Mistee with h6. That's never happened to her before. She wonders what's up with that?} 2. d4 {Mistee continues with d4....trying to control the center as her old coach Brian and the great and handsome lebanese/canuk tuff taught her.} a6 {Another surprising move by Mr. 19. But Mistee loves the pattern of the pawns.} 3. Nf3 {Mistee continues developing her pieces. Controlling space. Playing the center. Mistee remembers her coaching.} e6 {Now Mr. 19 is playing more normal for Mistee. Still a nice pawn pattern on the board.} 4. Bd3 {Mistee moves out the King's bishop to prepare for castling. She is still remembering her coaching. So far so good.} c5 {Easy19 moves c5, more of what Mistee considers a "normal" move since it controls more of the center. Mistee has a feeling that Easy19 is going to beat her to death with his pawns.} 5. c3 {Mistee moves c3 to add additional protection to the d4 pawn and to strengthen her pawn structure. Lined up pawns are pretty pawns.} cxd4 {Mr. 19 is destroying my lovely slanted pawn pattern.} 6. cxd4 {Should I take Easy19's pawn with the knight or my pawn? I like my knight where it is so I take with my pawn. Now I see that he could possibly put me in check with his bishop destroying all hopes for castling. Where are my chess coaches when I need them?} d5 {Easy moves his pawn forward creating a nice pawn line.} 7. e5 {Mistee moves her pawn forward...slowly advancing.....} Nc6 {Easy is developing.} 8. O-O {Finally I can castle!} Nb4 {Freddy's Knight approaches and threatens.} 9. Be2 {Mistee runs away} Ne7 {Freddy develops} 10. Nbd2 {Mistee tries to develop} Nf5 {Knight is getting closer} 11. b3 {Mistee moves a pawn} Qb6 {Queen moves.......} 12. Bb2 {Not sure what to do so I moved a bishop} Bd7 {Freddy gets his bishop out} 13. Rc1 {Big mistake here...} Nxa2 {See? } 14. Ra1 {Moving back....} Nb4 {At least the knight retreated} 15. Rc1 {Trying again} h5 {Freddy creeping up} 16. h3 {MIstee trying to do something} Be7 {Freddy developing nicely} 17. Bc3 {Mistee trying to develop, but her options are slim.} Na2 {Freddy threatening} 18. Rc2 {Mistee threatens back} Nxc3 {Knight takes bishop} 19. Rxc3 {Rook takes knight} g5 {Freddy creeping up more} 20. Qc2 {Need to get the queen out} Bb4 {Dang Freddy! Stop that!} 21. Rd3 {Running away. It's what I do best.} Rc8 {Freddy!!!!} 22. Qa2 {Running away again} g4 {Freddy attacking again} 23. hxg4 {trading pawns} hxg4 {Freddy won't let up} 24. Ng5 {Running away again} Bb5 {Freddy attacking} 25. Nc4 {I panicked} Qd8 {Not sure what Freddy was doing.} 26. Rdd1 {moving the rook to safety and attempting to protect my knight} Qxg5 {But then losing the other knight.} 27. Nb6 {Trying...something...?} Qh4 {Freddy....no} 28. g3 {Go away, black queen} Qh2# {I never saw that.  Walk the walk...more like stumble and crash!  :) :) :) Thank you, Freddy.}
