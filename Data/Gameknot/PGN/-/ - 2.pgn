1. d4 {This is an interesting game that ends suddenly. See if you can see the winning move...} Nf6 2. Nc3 d6 3. Bg5 Nbd7 4. e3 g6 {T} 5. Bd3 Bg7 {White hopes to gain a strong attack, Black chooses a Kings Indian type formation.} 6. Nge2 O-O 7. Qd2 c6 {Black wants to prepare a Queenside attack in case White plays 0-0-0.} 8. O-O-O {Which White does, but with some risk.} b5 {Black initates the attack before White gets a head start.} 9. h4 a5 10. e4 b4 {To drive away the N.} 11. Nb1 c5 {Starting a pawn storm.} 12. dxc5 dxc5 13. Nf4 {White wants to prepare h5.} Nb6 {Black proceeds with the attack.} 14. f3 c4 15. Be2 {Black has made progress. } Qc7 {Black has a good attack going, and does not want to exchange Queens.} 16. h5 {This normal looking move looks good fails for tactical reasons. } Nxh5 17. Nxh5 gxh5 {Black now has a very strong attack, and a threat, which White overlooks.} 18. Rxh5 {RxP??. Much better was a move like Qe3.} Bxb2+ {BxP + ! Just that simple. White resigns because after KxB (forced) c3  wins the Queen and Black still has an attack going.}
