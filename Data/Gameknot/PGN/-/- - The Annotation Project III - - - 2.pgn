1. e4 {The first 6 moves are the standard moves for this project.  Our free choice starts thereafter.} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ {Standard practice in this and the previous two annotation tourneys.} Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 {8...Ke8 offers a draw by repetition - hardly in keeping with the spirit of the tourney, though our leader, easy19, has used it to befuddle his opponents.} 9. Bxg4 Kb6 {Black has to avoid the fork of K and Q from e6, so either the K moves here or d6 or the Q moves.  ...Qe8 is proving quite a popular move in this tourney.  ...Qd4 or ...Qd5 have been less successful.} 10. Ne6 {This N dominates the board and prevents Black's B from developing naturally.} Qe8 {As previously noted, this is the favourite square for the Q.  I'm not sure whether it is better to move the Q here instead of 9...Kb6 or leave it to this move.  Chances is are it's just a case of transposition.} 11. d3 {White hastens to activate the second B, threatening to exploit the g1-a7 diagonal.} Nd7 {Black develops what he can.  I think the central development is preferable to ...Na6, though that has its counter-attacking charms (c2 looks vulnerable).} 12. Be3+ c5 {Black blocks the diagonal, even though it is unlikely he can defend the pawn indefinitely.  Freddy's advice to Black is to block the Bishops' activity, almost at any cost.} 13. b4 {?! While this is aggressive, it doesn't help White's development.  I'd prefer a N move.  Both 13. Na3 and 13. Nc3 look useful.} Rc8 14. Nc3 a6 {Black creates a hole into which to retreat, simultaneously contesting b5.  If Black doesn't create the hole then White may play 15. Nd5+ Ka6 16. Ndc7+ or 15. Nd5+ Kc6 16. c4.  Perhaps that would be better for Black...  The computer actually recommends 14...Ka6 preempting the above lines.} 15. Nd5+ {The computer prefers 15. bxc5+} Ka7 16. Rb1 {White brings another piece to bear on the beleaguered Black king.  At this stage Black looks virtually lost.} Qf7 {For the next four or five moves, the computer cries out for Black to play ...Nf6.  I remember being worried about revealed attacks on the Rc8 but, as easy19 has pointed out, White should eschew giving up the two bishops for the exchange: for it is in the two bishops that salvation lies.} 17. bxc5 Kb8 {Black again runs away from a revealed attack.} 18. d4 h5 19. Bh3 g5 {Black pushes back where he can, hoping to develop his B at last, with the immediate threat of trapping the White B and therefore also threatening White's N.  The threat is easily thwarted though.  I think the computer still prefers 19...Nf6.} 20. fxg5 Rg8 {The computer prefers an immediate 20...Qe8} 21. Rf1 Qe8 22. Nb6 {Now preferable was 22. Bf4+} Nxb6 23. Bf4+ {Less powerful than last move.} Ka8 24. Rxb6 {Over-confident.  24. Nc7+ looks winning.} Qa4 {At last Black can counter-attack!} 25. Kd2 Bg7 {The compuiter prefers an immediate check with 25...Qa5+.  I preferred the developing move!} 26. Ke3 {26. Rfb1 looks more to the point.} Qxc2 {Now Black creates a mating net} 27. Rfb1 {but now it's too late.} Qd3+ 28. Kf2 Bxd4+ 29. Nxd4 Qxd4+ 30. Ke2 Rxc5 {Black has time to play this because White has no check with which to complete his attack.} 31. Rb6xb7 Rc2+ {It's all over.} 32. Ke1 Qf2+ {?  Qg1 was mate.} 33. Kd1 Qe2# {but so was this :-)}
