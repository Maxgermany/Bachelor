1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just before my big win over gocall1 (Ger) bumped my rating back into the 1800s I got this victory.  It was in the Traxler MT.  I think I have done shedloads better with the white pieces than with the black ones.  Anyhow, it looked as if Julia, my Team Captain had a very strong attack going down the kingside.  She then sacrificed the exchange.  This turned out to be a bad move.  I needed to be very patient though and the main theatre of the battle turned out to be the h column.  Eventually I managed to control the h column with Glenda and my rook.  Lastly, my knight, which for the best part of the game was doing not a lot, came into f6 and had the last word before my opponent waved the white flag.  I will start further commentary on move 6.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 6. Bd5 {6. Bd5 - a common square has been Bb3.  I decided to put Fou Leblanc on d5 instead.} Rf8 7. O-O d6 8. Bxc6 bxc6 {8. ..... bxc6 - this exchange is recommended in the db and it does disturb the black queenside pawns.  Also when up a pawn, it is desirable to exchange pieces when you can.} 9. d3 h6 10. Nf3 Bg4 {10. ...... Bg4 - pin.} 11. h3 Bh5 12. c3 Nd7 13. Nbd2 {13. Nbd2 - I must relieve the pressure on f3 - at least this develops a piece but at the same time shuts in Fou Lenoir.  Still, there is the possibility of a fianchetto on b2 or a3 if I move my b pawn up to b4.} g5 14. b4 {14. b4 - so I carry out my plan mentioned in my previous note.  Here is step 1.} Bb6 15. Bb2 {15. Bb2 - and so I clear the decks.  Mission accomplished.} Qe8 16. g4 {16. g4 - risky but I must break that pin.} Bg6 17. Nh2 Rf4 18. Nc4 {18. Nc4 - improves the square of my knight and I am now planning to exchange it for Julia's dark square bishop to rid myself of the f2 pin.} h5 19. Bc1 {19. Bc1 - a sneaky switch-back.  My intention was to drive back that nasty looking black rook but .....} Qg8 {19. ...... Qg8 ??(!) - Is this a speculative sacrifice or an oversight - you the Inquest Jury decide.} 20. Bxf4 {20. Bxf4 - I decided to take the offering.} gxf4 21. Nxb6 cxb6 {21. ....... cxb6 - I now trade off my knight for that dark square bishop.  It untangles Julia's queenside pawns but I am the exchange up and have just traded off another set of pieces so I think it was worth untangling those footmen.  As in my previous note, the f3 pawn is now free to move.} 22. f3 {22. f3 - in order to bolster the g4 pawn.} Qg7 23. Rf2 {23. Rf2 - a rook lift with a dual purpose.  Maybe to attack down the kingside later on and more likely to cover Henry against any black heavies down the g column.} Rg8 24. Rg2 {24. Rg2 - now there is a potential pin on Julia's light square bishop should I play gxh5.} Bf7 25. Qe2 {25. Qe2 - now Glenda defends (not a pawn this time, surprise, surprise!) the rook on g2.  Actually, better take that back.  She is defending several pawns, the d, e, f and g pawns as well.  Still, you never know, she may end up on that g or h file one day doing something other than defending.} hxg4 26. hxg4 {26. hxg4 - the h column opens up but my knight is adequately protected.} Rh8 27. Rf1 {27. Rf1 - I bring up more reinforcements to cover Henry.  This is good practice for when I next get to face a kingside/queenside mating attack from the Master Mater.  It will be interesting to see if he could crack this defense!} Qh7 28. Rff2 {28. Rff2 - a nice flexible set up with the potential to turn my heavies from defenders into attackers.  I think my next plan should be to move Henry back towards the centre of the board before I try any counter-play on the h column.} Nf8 29. Kf1 Ng6 30. Ke1 {30. Ke1 - I have now accomplished my plan to move Henry to the safety of the centre which is blocked at the moment.} Nh4 31. Rg1 {31. Rg1 - first my rook must evade a black steed.} Be6 32. Kd1 {32. Kd1 - there is a potential knight fork on f3 to watch out for so I move Henry out of range of it.} Bc8 33. Qb2 {33. Qb2 - maybe Glenda can try her luck on the queenside though.} a6 34. a4 Bd7 35. c4 {35. c4 - this seems a bit of wait and see but not quite, there is a hidden threat to under-mine protection of the e5 pawn and allow Glenda to come to e5 and give a nasty check on the black king.  Julia susses it out and backs her knight off to g6.} Ng6 36. Nf1 {36. Nf1 - now I am preparing to contest that h column.} Qg7 37. Rh2 Rh4 38. Rgh1 {38. Rgh1 - thought it would be a good idea to double rooks here.  At least one pair of rooks will be traded off and as I am the exchange up this must be in my favour!} Rxh2 39. Rxh2 Bc8 40. Qg2 {40. Qg2 - now Glenda is eyeing up the h column.} Kf7 41. Qh1 {41. Qh1 - Glenda goes to h1 and I now threaten Rh7 pinning the Wicked Witch of the West to her other half.  She moves her king to f6.} Kf6 42. Rh6 {42. Rh6 - so I pin the knight instead.} Qg8 43. Qh5 {43. Qh5 - pile on!} Be6 44. g5+ Kf7 {44. ...... Kf7 - the only way to immediately avoid losing her knight.} 45. Nh2 {45. Nh2 - talking of knights, my own is heading for f6.} Bd7 46. Ng4 {46. Ng4 - the most sensible move would be Nxg4 but that is trading off yet another set of pieces.  It does save the black knight though.} Be6 {46. ...... Be6 - but this move does not and now I play Nf6 attacking the Wicked Witch of the West.  She must fly away on her broomstick and abandon that poor black steed to his fate.  Julia now waves the white flag.  Nice to have another game to report where I, The Beginner with the Class A rating, is on the attacking side.  I just hope I can put up a few more like this - cheers and bye for now - Joanne} 47. Nf6 {}
