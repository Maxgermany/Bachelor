[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 d5 {Turns out like a normal queen's pawn opening... } 2. e3 {but this move is new to me. Whenever I see 1.d4 I either reply 1...d5, where my opponent always plays the queen's gambit of 2.c4 (as far as I can remember, anyway) or 1...g6, with possible ideas of going into King's Indian Defence lines (though to be honest, I don't have a lot of experience in those lines) } Nf6 {knight development.... } 3. Bd3 {and bishop development. There doesn't seem to be much point in going to b5 - the bishop just looks silly there. } e6 {Opening a path for the dark-square bishop, but blocking the light square bishop - but then again, Black, like White, has nowhere sensible to put it } 4. Nd2 {White works on building his Stonewall } Be7 {seems a little passive to me, this move... but all these moves are thematic for the tournament so it has to be ok } 5. f4 {three out of White's four stonewall pawns have been deployed! } c5 {Black thrusts his own pawns forward... } 6. c3 {and here we go! White has now a very strong barrier in the centre of the board. Both sides will now be acting on the wings - White on the kingside, Black on the queenside from what I've seen so far. } O-O 7. Ngf3 c4 {Funnily enough, although this is still in the thematic moves for the tournament, this isn't considered the best move for Black, as it releases the tension in the centre. Of course, it doesn't mean that Black is lost or else there wouldn't be much point to this mini-tournament :P } 8. Bc2 Nc6 {And we have now reached the starting position for The Stone Wall Project. } 9. e4 {Freddy starts applying a little pressure right away. Black has two choices; take the pawn or leave it. Taking the pawn would bring White's e2 knight out to a more active position... } Nd7 {so I simply leave it. Why this move, though? Because of the sample game in the forum in the club. In that game, both White and Black go for a pawn storm on kingside and queenside respectively... and White won. (though 0-0 was played before e4) One of the ingredients of that attack was a knight on e5, and by moving this knight, it allows for f6 should White try that } 10. Qe2 {I'm not sure why this move was played (heading for f2 to escape, maybe?) perhaps it was a waiting move... } b5 {Confident that White cannot try an attack like that in the example game, Black starts activity queenside } 11. Ng5 {Now this was interesting... What is the idea behind this move? there were two possibilities that came to mind; 1) Hoping to attract the exchange with 11...Bxg5 12.fxg5 Qxg5 13.Nxc4! [Black has to deal with the discovered attack on the queen] and this blunts Black's pawn chain. 2) Like in the sample game, White may want to sac on f7 (that has happened to me in another game already, and the resulting position is interesting!). I could ignore the knight, but given who I'm up against, that doesn't seem too smart. } h6 {I preferred this over 11...f3 for fear of Nxh7 } 12. Ngf3 {and Freddy's knight retreats.... ok, so far, so good... } f5 {? And now here's my first mistake. My plan here was to own the f-file with my rook after a pawn exchange e.g. 13.exd5 exd5 [then White makes a move] 14...Re8 15.0-0 [to avoid the queen pin] Bg4 and hey presto! I control the e-file, and things like that can be good to achieve against such higher rated players. The other option was e5, and I didn't mind at all! The only worry I had was that there was a weakness in my castled position, but I figured that there was no way that Freddy could take advantage of that [famous last words ;)] } 13. exd5 {the one thing I didn't take into account in my calculations was... what would be White's 14th move? } exd5 {?? I could have saved something with Na5, but White still earns two pawns (unless Black finds a way to capture the e6 pawn) } 14. Qe6+ {! After this move was made, I realised that the guideline that I had set myself in my profile was incomplete. Here's what I added; 'Is there any piece on the board that is undefended [i.e. one that may be in danger of being forked?]' } Kh8 15. Qxc6 {Unfortunately, Black's troubles are far from over! White's queen forks the rook and the two pawns. } Rb8 {Black can defend against two of the threats... } 16. Qxd5 {but not the third one! } Bb7 {chasing the queen, and setting Trap #1 (not that likely to work but it's all I can hope for); 17.Qxb5?? Bxf3! } 17. Qe6 {The only other move that saves the queen, and the correct one too } Re8 {Still wanting to drive the queen away through a discovered attack [Trap #2; Bh4+! but Black could have done that straight away with 17...Rc8! 18.Qe2 Qb6 [unfortunately, even if White missed it, 19...Re6 wouldn't win the queen because of Ne5] } 18. O-O {Averting the threat easily enough... } Nc5 {? Trap #3; dxc5?? Bxc5+! Of course, Freddy doesn't fall for this... } 19. Qxf5 {....and another pawn drops. At this point, I was getting desperate, and the only hope I had was to try and trick Freddy into a blunder [If I played safe, I'm sure that he would have overwhelmed me eventually] Because of my last move, I now have to give up another point (19...Nd3 20.Bxd3 cxd3 21.Qxd3) } Bc8 {?? In an effort to drive the queen away, Black misses a very simple trick in the position... } 20. Qh7# {and...game over! I'll use this annotation as motivation for my next game against Freddy. It was expected that I would lose to him, but still, whenever I lose a piece in a game, it always smarts. Hopefully that won't happen in Game #2, and if I play right, I might be able to make it to my first endgame with him :) }
