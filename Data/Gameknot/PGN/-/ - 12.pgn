1. e4 {Game info on preceding page} e5 2. d4 exd4 3. Nf3 {This is the way I play into the Goring Gambit ("semi-Danish") or Scotch Gambit. It offers BL the option to try 3...c5 here, which will leave a large hole at d5 to exploit after 4.c3.  Also possible there is 4.Bc4 which gets complex tho after 4....b5!? 5.Bd5 Nc6 etc. not 5.Bxb5?? or Qa5  wins the Bishop. I usually opt for 4.c3 as being clearer play for WT, at least until I get more analysis done on the alternate line. } Qe7 {Unusual for BL, though I have seen it before. I am happy to permit him to take on e4 if he wishes. Then after Be2/o-o/Re1 the position should be quite powerful for WT. } 4. Bg5 {Offering BL either pawn, on e4 or b2. I also considered 4.c3 or captures of the d4 pawn. But I was in a scrappy mood and wanted to give him as much complications aor pawns as he would eat~! } f6 5. Bh4 d5 6. e5 Qb4+ {BL might have done better to continue developing and increasing his threat vs the e-pawn by ...Nc6. Then WT cannot play Bb5 due to Qb4  winning the Bishop, unless Nc3 giving up the N instead. } 7. Nbd2 Qxb2 8. Bd3 Bg4 9. O-O {Now WT is completely ready to play. Whereas BL is behind in development & has used more time on the Qxb2 pawn grab. With WT's lead in development overall, and his regional superiority of mobile pieces aimed at the center & K-side, he is ready to sac vs any opportunity. And will certainly do so if it will put the BL king on the run vs the fully mobilized WT army. } g5 {opportunity knocks! } 10. exf6 gxh4 {Also strong for WT, the simple Re1  . Or to try 11.Qe2  Kd8 12. f7 Nf6 13.Rfe1  Also I considered just 11.Re1  followed by Kd8 12.Qe2 and especially in blitz, such a less forcing line can often be very effective in getting them to overlook the point of it, or using much time to find it. While it is fairly obvious there is then Qe8  threatened, the defenses require a bit of thought. Still I rejected it since the correct defense seems to be the all too obvious capture 12...Nxf6, which he might make even as a knee jerk, that would cost me the pawn without any special gain ...tho still attacking.} 11. f7+ Kxf7 12. Ng5+ Ke8 13. Qxg4 Be7 14. Qc8+ {BL actually RESIGNS here, or else gets mated thusly: 14. . . . Bd8  15. Rae1  Ne7  16. Rxe7  Kxe7  17. Qe6  Kf8  18. Qf7#  ***********OR 14. . . . Bd8  15. Rae1  Kf8  16. Qxd8  Kg7  17. Ne6  Kh6  18. Qxh4#  (If 17...Kf7 then 18.Qf8# ) } Bd8 15. Rae1+ {}
