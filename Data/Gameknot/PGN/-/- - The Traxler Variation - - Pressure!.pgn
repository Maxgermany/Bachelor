1. e4 {This annotation is going to be a little different from my other ones... Instead of waiting until the game is finished, I'll annotate as the game is going on, so you can all get a better idea of my thoughts throughout the game :) ((alternate moves considered by me will be placed in double brackets, like what this sentence is in))} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 {Ok, the start of the Traxler variation..} 5. Bxf7+ {nothing special so far...I've been told that Nxf7 is playable, but I don't feel comfortable with trying it} Ke7 6. Bb3 {the usual move here is Bd5, but I can't seen any glaring changes with making this move} Qe8 {again, this isn't main line, but I'm not complaining - this could lead to an interesting game. Maybe nuntar's seen the Ion vs Freddy game... I'm assuming that the next move by Black would be Qh5...} 7. O-O {I'll defend my king for now... if Black plays Qh5 now, I'd be forced to trade because of the threat on the g5 knight - maybe Black wants to take advantage of my lack of development? ((here, I considered Nc3, with the idea of Nd5 - it will either break up Black's kingside structure of get my pawn on a good square))} d6 {Black's looking at getting his bishop out... I'm seeing Bg4 here. } 8. h3 {I don't really want the hassle, so I'll just stop the bishop getting there in the first place. This also has the benefit of stopping Ng4 - I like this move ((Nc3 was still in consideration))} Rf8 {slowly building up pressure on White. I'm thinking nuntar's next move will be Nxe4} 9. Nc3 {Why not? I've been planning to move my knight for a couple of turns now, and now it will also defend e4} Nd4 {I can only assume nuntar's considering Nxb3 on the next turn ((it also gets me thinking about Nd5+ again - I realise I can retake with the bishop instead of the pawn. I see a disadvantage for both moves - the pawn recapture blocks in my bishop, but the bishop capture allows for c6, driving back my bishop))} 10. Nd5+ {I'll go ahead with my plan.} Nxd5 {nuntar recaptures, and now I have the choice of exd5 or Bxd5. } 11. Bxd5 {I chose Bxd5 when I realised that nuntar was still threatening Nxb3 ((I guess these kinds of things I shouldn't overlook))} Qg6 {putting a threat to the knight. I don't really want to move it though. ((I don't realise it until a bit later, but nuntar actually threatens to capture the knight - it's open season when it retreats to f3 because of the queen's pin on the g2 pawn)) ((I expected c6 here)) ((as I annotate this, the game is already done - me and nuntar happened to be online at the same time to play it through...I'll try to remember my thoughts as best as I can))} 12. d3 {defending the knight. I'm also going to get a chance to develop pieces, which doesn't usually seem to happen for White. ((after this move, I was considering a knight sac with Nxh7, which, after Qxh7, could lead to a powerful attack; 13.Nxh7 Qxh7 14.Bg5+ Ke8, and now it's Black who's under pressure...but what would be White's best move after that?))} h6 {Black really wants that knight to go.. I've now noticed the danger of retreating the knight to f3. It took me a little while to find the next move... ((knight to h7 is now out of the question, because the bishop can't move to the g5 square))} 13. c3 {as far as I can see, this is my only option. I can get out of this with just one pawn down instead of a whole piece down} Nc6 {I expected hxg5 here [14.cxd4 exd4], and I think it might have been better. } 14. Nf3 {now I have a chance to retreat my knight. Now I have some breathing space I'll go in for the attack ((well, at least I thought I had some breathing space...)) } Bxh3 {I did not see this. Because of the threat of Qxg2 mate, I went on a full-scale panic for awhile before I see that my knight can defend ((I begin to fully appreciate the power the rook and queen have in this game. Those two pieces never move again for the rest of the game))} 15. Ne1 {I almost play Nh4, but that leaves my knight too exposed. This is probably the only option for White ((my plan for development for White doesn't seem like a possibility any more))} Bd7 {Personally I would have left the bishop there. Now the pressure is somewhat lifted from White} 16. b4 {I could start up a powerful pawn storm here - puts pressure on Black as well. ((I tried this method twice before, and they both failed. This one failed as well - I guess the moral is 'don't try it!'))} Bb6 {the only move. Now to continue the attack...} 17. b5 {chasing the knight away, and there is really only one place for it to go...((I considered a4 as well. I can't remember why I dismissed that idea))} Nd8 {shame...I would have liked to have played Bxb7 here.} 18. a4 {I had already planned to do this. I expected nuntar to move the a-pawn to provide an escape route for his bishop ((as has happened with my other two attempts))} a5 {I was actually hoping for this move. It allows me to continue my attack...((no it doesn't, but I thought I had one at the time.))} 19. bxa6 e.p. {and now the pawn can't recapture because of Bxa1, and next move I can take the b-pawn to create a dangerous pawn ((again, no it doesn't. White would have probably been better off leaving the position closed))} Rxa6 {Damn, I shouldn't have overlooked this move...well, I still have an attack...} 20. a5 {I can still force the bishop back ((I must have been really panicking here!))} Bxa5 {oh, of course... well, maybe I can make something of that pin...} 21. Bd2 {looking at opening up a discovered attack on the bishop...maybe first, I'll get rid of the b-pawn with Bxb7,} h5 {woah! That passed pawn could become a real danger - technically it is a passed pawn, as the g-pawn is still pinned} 22. Nf3 {I really need to get my pieces in action, and this halts the pawn advancement as well! ((after this move, my plan on the queenside is forgotten))} Bb6 {hmm....offering to trade rooks...} 23. Rxa6 {might as well... I don't want to have to deal with pressure from both sides} bxa6 {of course...I think I might have an attack which starts out with Bg5+, but I can't see a good way to pull it off} 24. Ba2 {I'll wait and see what Black does first} Bg4 {my attack looks even more bleak now! } 25. Qe1 {The pin is broken, and I now turn to another attack, this time from the queenside... this move, then c4, then a knight sacrifice with Nxe5 followed by Bb4+...again, I can't really see a defining attack, though} Bxf3 {the queen pin again! Doesn't look like I can stop checkmate now... ((here I resign... so is this style of annotating good? :) ))}
