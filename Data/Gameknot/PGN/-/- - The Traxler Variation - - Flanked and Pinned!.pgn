1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Bxf7+ {Thematic position, and White goes with the more popular bishop capture } Kf8 {I prefer this as Black, as it keeps the queen diagonal open for a discovered attack on the knight if Black chooses to move his own } 6. Bc4 {one of three retreat posts for the bishop. As usual, Black needs now to deal with the threat of Nf7 } d5 {?! It seemed a good move at the time - it stops Nf7 and grabs a large portion of the centre. However, this 'strong' centre... } 7. exd5 Nxd5 {...as shown, will be weakened, as Freddy shows over the next five moves... } 8. Qh5 {! White takes advantage of the absence of the knight and attacks - he now threatens mate with Qf7 (Question; does this position count as 'too many pieces queenside?') } Qd7 {? 8...g6 would have been better. This move blocks in my light-square bishop } 9. Qf3+ {White lands another check, while at the same time threatening the d5 knight } Nf6 {Pretty much forced, if Black wants to avoid material loss. the alternative 9...Nf4? would have failed due to 10.g3!, which wins the knight } 10. Ne6+ {! The point of White's last move. White's knight jumps into enemy territory, using the protection of the bishop to fork the king and the unprotected bishop (though you might be able to see why Black doesn't lose material) It also further proves that Black's Qd7 was a bad move, as if the queen was not blocking the bishop; 10:Ne6+ Bxe6 11.Bxe6 Nd4 12.Qh3 and Black comes out with a more favourable position than in this game } Ke7 {I made this move hoping to play Rd8 later, but though I won't call it a mistake, this move is the start of what brought about my downfall in this game (of course, Kf7?? is just horrible; Nxc5+!!) } 11. Qg3 {White doesn't take the bishop straight away, instead threatening a very deadly 12.Qxg7! I thought at the time that Freddy was testing me here, seeing if I fell into the trap of trying to save my bishop instead of noticing the threat, but White's queen now also eyes the e5 pawn - I don't know whether that had been brought into consideration as well } g6 {pretty much the only logical reply to this threat } 12. Nxc5 {Expected, but Black wins back material immediately with... } Qd4 {! I realise this move was forced anyway, but it's my best move of this game. One of White's pieces has to go! } 13. d3 {! A simple move, but I like it all the same - White frees his dark-square bishop with tempo, and protects the more influential of his pieces } Qxc5 {And now, though Black can boast control of the d4 square, his centre isn't as strong as it was (Black would probably want his queen for uses other than centre control) } 14. Bg5 {White pins the knight to the king, while developing his bishop } Nd4 {?! The move itself wasn't a mistake, but here I made the mistake of assuming that Freddy would exchange at f6. Wrong! Not only was the exchange not forced, most people prefer their bishops to the knights anyway. I had considered Rf8 before this move, and if I had played that, I would have been able to survive for much longer (in fact, based on this position I like Black's chances) The only was for White to stop the King/Knight fork would have been to move his king, which strips White of castling rights (15.Na3? b5! 16.Bb3 b4, and White is going to lose material)  } 15. Nc3 {!? The fork is ignored completely... but White won't lose material; 15...Nxc2+ 16.Kd2 Nxa1 17.Nd5+ Kf6 18.Bxf6 Rd5 19.Ne3 [to stop 2 piece/rook exchange] and White captures the trapped knight next move. Looking at that line, I saw White as better off afterwards, and wanted to stop it from happening, so I played... } c6 {?? Ugh, horrible move! I was looking at this move as both defensive and offensive (16...b5) but there are two huge problems with that idea; 1)It is in no way defensive (the knight has another square to attack on) and 2)It allows White a powerful offensive } 16. Ne4 {! The knight could not have been better placed; it forks the queen and the under protected(and pinned) knight, and the queen can't retreat to protect the knight (and even if she could, Black would still be behind three material points - two pieces for the queen) Black is about to be seriously hurt! } Qa5+ {This is just a stalling move, really. It was my only hope to get a tempo to save material loss, but I could already see the move that would stop this plan, and I just had to hope that Freddy did not... } 17. b4 {! I think I might have had better chances of winning the lottery :) The b-pawn is immune; 17...Qxb4? 18.c3! but Black could have continued; 18...Nc2+ 19.Kd1 Qxc3 - I didn't see that at the time, but if I had I would have played it - I would have still lost, though (actually, it would have lost more quickly) } Nxc2+ {The best way to get anything out of this mess, I think } 18. Kf1 {I was expecting Kd1 here, driving away the knight, but I think this may have been another one of Freddy's traps... } Qxb4 {?? and I fell right into it! my reasoning was that after White's attack, Black could (finally) begin an attack of his own. The problem was there was no 'after'.... (before you read further, go onto my profile and take a look at the puzzle I made from this position) } 19. Qxe5+ {!! Freddy announces mate in 6 } Kd7 {Not that it affects the outcome, but this move loses quicker - the mate in 6 is now a mate in 3 } 20. Nxf6+ Kd8 21. Ne8+ Kd7 22. Qc7+ {Of course, Qe6# is mate, but Freddy gave me this extra move to ask me to do this annotation (and the puzzle) and answer these questions; 1) Where did I make the wrong moves? and 2) How did White play the game? } Kxe8 {((after all, what's a good mating attack without a sacrifice thrown in?)) } 23. Qf7# {so, the answers; 1) I made a minor mistake early on, with 8...Qd7?, but my two major blunders were 15...c6?? (neglecting my defence when I needed it most) and the losing move, 18...Qxb4?? (though to be fair, Black was lost at that point anyway - White's attack would have left me 8 points behind which is disastrous, especially against someone rated almost 1000 point higher than you) on a slightly more long-term point, it was underestimating the pin from the bishop. 2) As the queenside was protected and my centre good, White took the fight to the kingside instead, with effective results. He also took advantage of the pin when Black did nothing about it, and finally he had a great attack - early game, White's bishop and knight were targeting the areas around my king, and once the knight dropped off, it was the two bishops. And one last point; White pretty much had the initiative the whole game, whereas all that went through Black's mind was 'defence!' }
