1. e4 {So easy19 has been twisting my thumbs for me to annotate this game. Anyways, I called out a challenge to any expert or master in the WtW club as my way of having fun. easy19 was the only one who accepted this challenge, and this is what happens when two twisted players meet. A fight for the center the entire game. WARNING: Don't be fooled by his rating. He is 2200 at heart.} e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 {Here we are the great King's Gambit Accepted: Bishops Gambit. I know what some people might say, and yes that Queen can go to h4 and ruin my castle. However, I believe there is some compensation for playing 3. Bc4 instead of 3. Nf6.  A. The KGA Modern defense can not be played generally. B. The King is perfectly fine on f1 unlike most people might tell you. C. You don't really lose a tempo because Black has to move the queen back at some point in fear of getting trapped on the kingside, and becoming a tempo punching bag. D. It isn't really played much, so it has the fun of not being over analyzed like 3. Nf3 was. E. It's fun to laugh at the "you always have to castle" notion.  f. It'll make you smile, so it is worth your while. } Nf6 4. Nc3 c6 {King's Gambit: Accepted, Bishop's Gambit, Bogoljubow Defense  Probably one of the best ways to defend. Basically black is supporting d5 to claim some of the center, and kind of transpose to a modern defense.} 5. d4 Bb4 {Pinning my knight to my king.} 6. e5 {A strange move to protect the pawn from being taken by the knight because of the pin on c3, and circumvents d5 because of en passant. However, it allows the knight to strongly go to e4.} Ne4 7. Qf3 {Protecting my knight; attacking his knight and f4} Qh4+ {The famous move of the KGA: BG. I guess it's a little more nice when the knight can't go to f3.} 8. Kf1 {My king's just sitting around looking at all the people in his territory, and thinking "This really isn't scary at all."} d5 {Some people might see Ng3+ wins the rook for a knight and messes up my kingside pawn structure. This puts the queen in a corner and out of play, and surprisingly isn't worth the trouble. d5 is a nice play fighting for the center still.} 9. exd6 e.p. {Who doesn't take an en passant when they have one, seriously?} Nxc3 10. bxc3 Bxd6 11. Qe4+ {I think his king covered it's face with it's hands at this point.} Qe7 {This is kind of like a movie when a person jumps in front of a bullet for another person. And it's all dramatic and stuff. You know?} 12. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {That kings angry. I just killed his wife right in front of him. I think it shows courage to the pawns showing he is strong or something and not some slow fat worthless guy who probably shouldn't even get protection.} 13. Kf2 {Setting up my h1 rook to get out. Ne2 is probably better.} Be6 {Getting rid of my good bishop: fixing his pawns. Seriously, do you see how easy 2000+ rated chess is.} 14. Bxe6 {Taking it because it's better no one has that diagonal than him. Bb3 is also possible and probably better.} fxe6 15. Nf3 {Getting ready for The Center: Round 2.} Rf8 16. Re1 Rf5 {I guess let's just all attack e5.} 17. c4 Nd7 {I have no idea why we decided this square was where we would throw down. One of those center of the board things I guess.} 18. Bd2 {All our pieces are developed. We just hit the middle game!!! I was just keeping my bishop on f4 and connecting the rooks.} c5 {My d-pawn is kind of important for center equilibrium. That is why he attacked it. I felt the game tilting his way a little, but not anything unmanageable.} 19. d5 {I protected it by having everything attack it. Cool huh? King's pinned by my e1 rook. I probably should of mentioned this earlier.} Ne5 {attacking my c4 pawn. I don't take it because that gives up the center. And it stopped that pin thing.} 20. Re4 {I protected c4 and attacking f4. } exd5 {He takes it because there is no more time for setting up. It's now or never.} 21. cxd5 Kd7 {Breaking my pin.} 22. Rb1 {Ok. c4 is probably better. Nxe5 also better, but I was drawn to this move and couldn't help it. Winning isn't everything, and I thought this combo was cooler.} Nxf3 23. Rxb7+ Kc8 24. Rxg7 Be5 25. Kxf3 Bxg7 26. Re8+ Kb7 27. Re7+ Kb6 28. Rxg7 Rxd5 29. Bxf4 {Well, I thought it was a cool little sequence. And to be honest, if I was a super crazy awesome computer. this might be a draw, but I'm a lowly human and can only do so much. The rest of this is pointless semantics of me trying to hold on.} h5 30. g4 Rf8 31. gxh5 Rxh5 32. Kg3 Rfh8 33. Kf3 Rd5 34. Re7 Rd4 35. Re6+ Kb5 36. Re2 Ra4 37. Bg3 {Hey!!! Look Freddie that pawn is free!} Rf8+ {I guess he's just heartless or something. That a-pawn is shaking out in the cold all alone being tortured.} 38. Kg2 Ra3 39. Kg1 Rff3 40. Kg2 Rfc3 {Good game Easy. Everyone please feel free to comment as my annotation is really just me talking about nothing to do with chess and very uninformative.}
