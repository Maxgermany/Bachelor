1. e4 {Here is the computer analysis : http://gameknot.com/img/i/computer.png} g6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 {I had a look at Freddy's games and I feared his pawn's structures. I thought that, playing so would limitate the risks and I prefer open games.} Bg7 4. Nc3 {I'll try to defend the d pawn as long as possible to limitate white's pawn developement (see above).} Nf6 5. Bc4 Nbd7 6. Nf3 Nb6 7. Bb3 {The d pawn won't live long and the bishop stays on a good diagonal.} O-O 8. O-O a5 9. a4 {Blocking the queenside. The fight has to be on the center first, aiming toward e7 and f7 after (or, at least, this is my plan).} Nbxd5 {The d5 pawn was doomed, anyway, I just wanted to defend it as long as possible.} 10. Nxd5 Nxd5 {Now white has taken one move advance in developpement but the black's knight is dangerously placed and has to be Watched carefully.} 11. h3 {I co not want a pin on the f knight.} b6 {enabling the LSB to come on b7 or a8, if suited.} 12. Re1 {Taking control of the half open file.} Qd6 {To enable a further Rd8, take the control of c5 and support a future pawn there if black plans to contest the d pawn.} 13. Bg5 {To force 13. ... f6 (weakening the king, pinning the d5 knight and preventit it to move on f6 so that it has only one escaping square available (b4). drawback : my bishop will have to move twice but I estimate it is still valuable.} e6 {I had expected 13 f6. This has the advantage not to weaken the king but white's DSB controls the d8 square which is good for white} 14. Qd2 {14.c3 was another candidate move but this one prevents 14. ... h6} Bb7 {Bishop on the long diagonal} 15. c3 {LSB unprotected but unattaquable during at least 2 moves} Rfc8 {Unexpected move : logical to support a further c5 but letting the queen uncovered and the knight pined if dxc5. I hope it's an inaccuracy.} 16. Rad1 {To menace the queen (and, indirectly, prevent 16. c5) - White's developpement is completed : center strongly supported - Good possibilities to attack black's kinside. Weaker on the queenside ("on ne peut pas tout avoir !" The french says...)} c5 {!? I have the impression that it's a mistake. One of us overlooks something (and I'm afraid it's me) : white will have a better center and black a pawn superiority on the queenside} 17. dxc5 {Obvious move to get the best of white superiority on the d file (black cannot double the queen with a rook because of white's DSB).} bxc5 18. c4 {Blocking the c5 pawn and menacing the black knight which cannot retreat (at the price of abandoning the LSB to his doom but one cannot have everything)} Qb6 {Queen safe and menace on b3 but all of black army is on his right wing. The center is protected by minor pi√®ces and white has strong attacking possibilities. It may probably imply a sac.} 19. cxd5 {Another candidate move was 19. Ba2 but this one is more dynamic, aggressive and conform to white's overall plan (furthermore, I still fear Freddy's capacities with pawns, so that their elimination seems safe).} Qxb3 {Black had  little other choice.} 20. dxe6 {White carries on his plan : bring at least one rook on line 7} fxe6 {Until now everything has been conformed to my plan ! Unexpected but I had overlooked one move : 21. ... Bd5 blocks the center and black will be able to take the and b pawns in a few moves (which was probably his plan)} 21. Ne5 {Black has to pay attention, as white's attack is dangerous. I can see some mating sequences, even if black plays 21. Bd5. At least, I'll give Freddy to think (or at the very least, I hope so...).} Qd5 {Black seems to think as well that white's attack is dangerous and uses a drastic way to block it : mating menace and forced queen's trade.} 22. Qxd5 {Only move. Black will block the center and I could afford to sacrifice one of the rooks to have rook and queen passed but not if I only have one rook left.} exd5 {I was expecting Bd5 but this gives black a passed pawn and one isolated pawn So. At this point : no immediate threat, material is equal, the black king is unsafe, the center is contested and strongly attacked by both sides, black has the 2 bishops, white has a possible attack with the knight toward the rooks and will probably take control of the open file. the situation is slightly in black's favour but not much. After 22 moves, against a master, it's not so bad.} 23. Nd7 {Freeing the e file and menacing a treble fork attack by 24. Nb6. or a chess by 24. Nf6+ Of course, the b pawn hangs but I hope that white will get sufficient compensation for it.} Bxb2 {I was expecting 23. h6, obliging my DSB to leave. White is now one pawn late and black has 2 joined passed pawn but I estimate that white will have sufficient attack to get quickly an advantage to compensate (treble fork by Nb6 or chess by knight f6+) with possibility  to bring one rook on the 7 line and 2 rooks on the open e file). } 24. Nb6 {Mistake, the GK computer suggests 24. Rb1. } c4 {Black seems to think that the advantage of the 2 passed pawns compensate the late in material if white takes one of the rooks.} 25. Nxd5 {After carefull analyse, I think that 25. Nxa8 or 25. Nxc8 is a bit risky and I prefer to neutralise at least one of the passed pawns to try to obtain a draw (it will be hard because I have to be accurate. The situation is not complicated and it's useless to expect a mistake from black).} Bxd5 26. Rxd5 {Completing the trade} c3 27. Bc1 {Maybe a mistake but I found nothing else to do.} Rce8 {I overlooked this move. } 28. Rf1 { if 28. Bxb2 Rxe+ if 28. Rxe8+Rxe8 and white is in serious trouble (but maybe less than in the line we followed : the white rook is on a closed file.)} Re2 29. Bxb2 {I couldn't find any other option} cxb2 {Is it still a possibility to draw ? I'm not sure. Furthermore, I'm not good at pawn and rooks endgames } 30. Rb1 {I hesitated to pay 30. Rb5 but white will probably have to bring the 2 rooks on the first line and this move enables it.} Rc8 {A classical attack with pawn on the second line and opposite king on the first one.} 31. Rdd1 {Only move.} Rc4 32. g3 {The white king has to quit the first line.} Rcc2 {I thought black would have plaid 32. ... Rxa4 to have a second passed pawn, supporting the first one.} 33. Rdf1 {Only move to save the f pawn.} Kf7 {The black king probably expects to travel up to a4} 34. Kg2 {Most urging : white king off the first file.} Ke6 35. Rbd1 {Blocking the black king.} Rcd2 {Black offers a trade.} 36. Kf3 {i estimate that the trade can wait and that my king had to come as near as possible from the a and b pawns. } Rxd1 37. Rxd1 Rc2 38. Rb1 {No much choice (attacking the king is of no use, since he is aiming at b3 or c3)} Kd5 39. Ke3 {To make it a bit more difficult for black.} Kc4 40. f4 {white is almost in zugzwang, there are little moves left.} Kc3 41. Rd1 {The rook doesn't need to stay on b1} Rc1 {another option for black would have be to send his king on a2} 42. Rd3+ {Almost forced} Kc4 43. Rd4+ {Now, the question is : how many moves will black need to give the mate ? (I decide that I'll go anyway until the very end).} Kc5 {I'm surprised. I was expecting 43. ... Kb3 44. Rd3+  Ka2 45. Rd2 Ka1 and white cannot prevent black to play 44. ... B1 except by loosing his rook.} 44. Rd7 {The rook has to move, else it is lost in 2 moves and the king cannot come on e4 without being in chess the next move. The promotion of the b pawn is unavoidable.} b1=Q 45. Rxh7 Rc3+ 46. Kd2 Qb2+ 47. Kd1 Rc1# {Thanks for the game, Freddy. }
