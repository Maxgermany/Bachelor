1. e4 {Last game I opened with a knight move. I've since been using the KP. I've had much more success. } Na6 {Didn't expect that, I've not had someone play this before.} 2. d4 {I like the center, but awaiting the flank attack.} b6 {Here it comes.} 3. c4 {I thought if I could get the d pawn on d5, that would be a strong center.} c5 {I really wish I could've played d5, but it just doesn't look good anymore. I would like to know what others think.} 4. Be3 {Protecting the pawn to try and keep some center control} cxd4 {There goes the center.} 5. Bxd4 {My bishop announces "Here I am!"} d6 {Further central loss. I don't want to push my pawns forward too much further, lest he get behind them.} 6. Qd3 {This felt premature, but I liked the symmetry.} Nc5 {Symmetry is really overrated.} 7. Qe3 {Didn't want to trade my bishop for a knight. It looked like an open game and I think the bishop more valuable.} e5 {I can't remember exactly when it happened, but I am fairly disappointed in my performance and this point. } 8. Bxc5 {I decide to trade rather than give up ground.} bxc5 {Now he has the symmetry!} 9. g3 {I decide to fianchetto to see if I can make 42 moves. I also noticed black's queenside rook just sitting there.} Ne7 {Didn't even consider what he might be up to there, seemed defensive.} 10. Bg2 Nc6 {Wait, I thought that was a defensive knight.i thought he would try to fork my king & rook, but I had the queen in place.} 11. Nf3 {Containing the fianchetto plan and in case he moves center, I'll trade.} Nd4 {I believe it was at this point Freddy announced "central square domination", but he did put a smiley face on it, which was nice of him.} 12. Nxd4 {Take.} exd4 {Take. My pawns look silly. I've not seen this before, but reminds me of a split when bowling.} 13. Qd3 {Hiding the white queen behind all the pawns. Hoping to get an opportunity to develop the other knight soon. Queen has moved three times already, knight not at all... not good.} Rb8 {I like the fianchetto, because sometimes people forget about the bishop and later in the game the rook capture is a surprise. So much for the surprise. In this move, black takes that surprise away and pressures b2 requiring a response. In fact, since I initially moved the queen black has driven the moves I make.} 14. b3 {Seemed reasonable.} g6 {Now he's eyeing my rook... I seeeeee you!} 15. O-O {Fianchetto complete... thinking I might make 42 here.} Bg7 {Better move that rook.} 16. Nd2 {Should've moved the knight much earlier.} O-O {I like the white pawn chain and the fianchetto. The knight seems well positioned. However, the loss at d4 is haunting me.} 17. Rab1 {Take away the "rook surprise"} Bb7 {Now he has the bishops pointed through the center and the pawns are holding as well. Black is so focused on the middle now, I wonder if I can go around it all.} 18. a3 {I push the a pawn to perhaps weaken the central pawns and then attack them, but I did think if it failed I run the risk of opening up the queen side for an attack   (***spoiler alert***) Which is exactly what happened!} a5 {Didn't think this was a problem because of my rook, if only I would have gone one step further in analysis.} 19. b4 {Gulp} axb4 {Take} 20. axb4 {Take} cxb4 {Even through the black pawn structure in the center is weaker, the bishops are still staring down from across the board. Not sure what to do about them. } 21. Nb3 {Following through on my plan to weaken and attack the center.} Ba6 {I didn't understand this move. I think maybe he didn't want me to move c5, but I wasn't planning that anyway.} 22. Nxd4 {Take.} Qc7 {He really likes c4.} 23. Nb5 {Seemed like a good move.} Bxb5 {Take.} 24. Rxb4 {Blunder... Not really sure what I was thinking on this move. I should have taken the bishop.} Bc6 {Two down and really didn't want to be here.} 25. Rfb1 {Had planned on trying to line up the rooks and queen, but it was truly desperation.} Rxb4 {Take} 26. Rxb4 Rb8 27. Qb3 Rxb4 28. Qxb4 {Rooks are gone.} Be5 {I was just recently reading about the strength of bishop pairs, so not really thrilled that black has two and I only have one.} 29. f4 {Another blunder, I might have made it to 42 if not for this move.} Qa7+ {And so the king is on the run.} 30. Kf1 Bd4 {Queen side is wide open. } 31. Qxd6 {I thought this was a neat fork...} Qa1+ {...unable to act on it though.} 32. Ke2 {Run forest run!} Qb2+ {Run} 33. Kd3 {Run} Qc3+ {Run} 34. Ke2 {Run} Qe3+ {Run} 35. Kd1 {Run} Ba4# {Done.   Thanks for the game Freddy. Not sure how you always get me to deviate from my opening plan. Next time I will remember!}
