1. e4 {Hopefully this helps show how white can dominate this opening. This game is on 21. Rfb1+ the last moves are forced so I don't feel bad about showing this.} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 {!! This sacrifice is very strong this time around. Due to the presence of the c6 pawn.} Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 {The main line.} Qd5 {I'm still under the impression that Qe8 is best. I don't like this choice all that much Qd6 looks more appealing that Qd5.} 10. Ne6+ {Forcing the black king to b6.} Kb6 11. d3 {Opens line for the dsb and threats blacks king heavily.  } exd3 {The is the first big concession on blacks part its just so slow.} 12. Be3+ Ka5 {c4 might be slightly better, because it gives blacks king more space to run.  } 13. a3 {keeps black on edge, as will be seen.} Qxg2 {??? walks into forced mate in 9.} 14. b4+ {Ka6 Nc6# Ka4 Nc3# leaving Kb5} Kb5 15. Nc7+ {Forcing the king to c4.} Kc4 16. Be6+ {Black must block with the queen.} Qd5 17. Bxd5+ {Taking back with the bishop allows the mate I don't think taking with the knight offers mate.} cxd5 18. Nd2+ {Push blacks king further up the board away form the undeveloped pieces.} Kc3 19. Nb5+ {Pushing the king all the way into white territory. } Kb2 {Kxc2 is also met by O-O. Kxc2 Rc1 Kb2 Bd4# is one mate the other uses the Ra2# idea.} 20. O-O Nc6 {Does nothing.} 21. Rfb1+ Kxc2 22. Ra2# {}
