[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Englund gambit"]

1. d4 {WoW game with easy19 (playing black). White opens with the d4. Hoping to play Queen's Gambit, I seem to have success with that opening.} e5 {No Queen's Gambit  :(.   Black defends with e5 immediately challenging the d4 pawn (England Gambit). There's a nice YouTube video mjshark titled: "Traps in the Englund Gambit (1.d4 e5?!)", if you're interested. I wish I have found this during the game. I wasn't familiar with this opening and by dumb luck avoided one of the more common traps (see move 4). Multiple responses here, but taking the pawn is really the only sound approach I could find. Here are some others I reviewed: (a) 2. d5 - pass the pawn. Gives white a temporary advanced position, but seems difficult to defend in the long run and leaves a gaping hole behind it. (2) 2. c3 - defend the pawn. Provides an unlikely potential swap of a wing pawn for a central pawn. While I'm waiting for the swap, it hems in the Queen side knight. (3) 2. dxe5 - take the pawn. Seems to be the right move, gains early material and opens things up a bit. Unlikely I can keep the material advantage, but early +1 against a master can help build confidence! (4) 2. Nf3 - defend the pawn. Leads to the knight running around the board in the early game allowing black to develop. Didn't seem like a great idea.} 2. dxe5 {Chose option 3. +1 on a master player! Woo Hoo... party at my house!  (big deal, wait until you see how the game progresses)} Nc6 {Immediately challenged by the knight. } 3. Nf3 {and white defends.... falling right into easy19's trap scenario.} Qe7 {If you're black, you are loving life right now and salivating at the prospect of 4. Bf4. If white continues to defend the pawn with his bishop, quick trouble! Look carefully: 4... Qb4! Queen check and threatens both the bishop and the ultimately the queen side Rook. If white doesn't make the right moves here, this turns ugly really fast and could end in an embarrassing mate. I wish I had studied this beforehand. } 4. Qd5 {Didn't have a pawn to back up e4, so I did this.} f6 {At this point, I had this grand vision of getting the white LSB to c4 and causing black all kinds of problems. Sad fact: white's LSB never moved the entire game... {sigh}} 5. exf6 {Resigned to losing the pawn, at least I can claim for one move I'm +2 on a master... woo hoo, party at my house! I actually opened a bottle of wine and had a great evening with my wife and friends (well, actually unrelated to this game, but thought it would add an interesting note to the annotation).} Nxf6 {so there goes my grand plan. Black is now all set for the kill. He's developed both his knights and beginning to chase my queen around the board. BTW, I'm also playing another master right now and right around this time he advised me in another game "the further away from d1 the queen gets, the more uncomfortable she is"... she's uncomfortable! White should really back down and move her back to d1 or d2.} 6. Qg5 {but instead decided to try something different. My original strategy was Queen's gambit gaining control of e5. Is that still possible? I've learned changing strategies in mid-game never really seems to work out. So this move was to try and maintain this goal.} d5 {But I realize now that black doesn't really care about e5 anymore. Just setup a nice outposts on c4 and e4.. white queen is way out of position.} 7. Nc3 {white attacks the pawn} Nb4 {setting up for the fork} 8. Nd4 {only defense, but awaiting the pawn threat on the knight.} c5 {black doesn't disappoint} 9. Qd2 {Blunder #1 (don't worry there are more!)  I was so concerned my Queen was out position, I failed to recognize I was pinning my own knight. Almost any move would have been better here. The best move was a3, exchanging knights.n} cxd4 {during the game, this is where I realized my first error.} 10. a3 {too little, too late.. but this seems to be the best move given the position.} dxc3 {yuk. At this point, I thought it would be a good idea to keep the queen safe back near the king, so....} 11. bxc3 {Blunder #2. Analysis says the best move was 11. Qxc3. Even that move doesn't really allow white to get back in shape. so....} Ne4 {Yikes. Looks like I need to move my Queen. I didn't realize the queen is already lost. so....} 12. Qd4 {Blunder #3. Didn't see the fork I setup for black. Best move, axb4, involved sacrificing the queen to avoid the impending destruction. However, the either way, the game is pretty much over.} Nxc2+ {Fork number one.. queen is gone. At this point, we discussed white resignation and easy was ok with it. However, I thought maybe the end game might be worth annotating given the knight's overwhelming advantage. It is enjoyable to watch, not so much to play as white.  :)} 13. Kd1 {Bad news, game is lost.. good news, no more white blunders from here on out :)} Nxd4 {knights are doubled right in front of the king... just looks menacing even though white will take the } 14. cxd4 Nxf2+ {thought this was worth showing because the bishop is still sitting where I left it.} 15. Ke1 Nd3+ {not sure why black didn't take the rook... but I suspect there's a quicker mate this way} 16. Kd2 Nxc1 {there's a mate(8) on the next move.} 17. Kxc1 {mate(8)} Qe3+ 18. Kc2 Bd7 19. g3 Ba4+ 20. Kb2 Qb3+ 21. Kc1 Qc2# {and there it is... thanks for the game easy19!!}
