1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Just to let you know that I met my usual fate against Freddy, you can now guess what that is!  Anyhow, it was not before he found himself in Old Matey's shadow so it was a case of us being at each other's throats but he got in first!  We pick up the action on move 6 when after responding to the main line 5. ....... Ke7 he plays Bb3.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Bxf7+ Ke7 6. Bb3 Rf8 {6. ....... Rf8 - also fairly standard.} 7. Nc3 d6 {7. ...... d6 - this move is played to bolster my e5 pawn should the white horsie return to f3.} 8. d3 Nd4 {8. ..... Nd4 - an aggressive placement for my knight but Freddy's response is equally aggressive .....} 9. Nd5+ {9.  Nd5+ - this check triggers off some exchanges.  Firstly a knight trade.} Nxd5 10. Bxd5 h6 11. c3 Ne6 12. d4 exd4 13. Nxe6 Bxe6 14. Bxe6 Kxe6 15. cxd4 Bb6 {15. ...... Bb6 - yup, a lot of wood has cleared from the board and I am a pawn down.  Freddy now castles.} 16. O-O Qh4 {16. ..... Qh4 - whoho, whoho, Glenda has the temerity to leap on her broomstick and put Freddy's king under her glare!} 17. f4 Rae8 {17. ...... Rae8 - this was intentioned to hide Henry away on the queenside and for my cannons to attack Freddy on the kingside.} 18. a4 a6 {18. ...... a6? - In retrospect I think a5 would have been so much better.} 19. a5 Ba7 20. Qb3+ {20. Qb3+ - ouch, a queen fork.  Not only does the b7 pawn fall but the Witch crosses my idea of tucking Henry away on the queenside.} Kd7 21. Qxb7 Bxd4+ 22. Kh1 g5 {22. ........ g5 - I now proceed with a kingside mating attack.  How dare I contemplate doing this to the Master Mater!} 23. Ra4 Be5 {23. .... Be5 - if PXB?? then Freddy wins Fou Lenoir but loses his rook and his king!} 24. Rc4 Rec8 {24. ..... Rc8 - defends Henry but this will fail later on.} 25. Qxa6 Bxf4 26. Bxf4 Rxf4 {26. ..... Rxf4 - keeps my mating atack going, this time a back row mate threat.} 27. Rd1 Qg4 {27. ..... Qg4 - again keeping the back row under the hammer but now Freddy launches his attack and that is successful ...... for him, sigh!} 28. Rxc7+ Rxc7 29. Qxd6+ Kc8 30. Qd8+ {30. Qd8+ - nasty.} Kb7 31. a6+ {31. a6+ - nice pawn sac.  One can only admire.} Kxa6 32. Qa8+ {32. Qa8+ - Henry is now hunted and he will not escape.} Kb6 33. Rd6+ Kc5 34. Qd5+ {34. Qd5+ - now Henry must face the firing squad.} Kb4 35. Rb6+ Ka4 36. Qb5# {36. Qb5 MATE - the kiss of death.  Well played Freddy.}
