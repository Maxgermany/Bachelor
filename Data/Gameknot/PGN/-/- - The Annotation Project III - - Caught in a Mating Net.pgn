1. e4 {Hi everyone!  It has been quite a while since I have annotated a game, although I have been away on holiday for the best part of August and it has taken me a little while to get back into the swing of things.  However, I am pleased to report a good win with the white pieces in the Master Mater's Annotation's Project Part 3.  I will now give you the Gameknot Analysis link to enable you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14263663&rnd=0.8295382966212421.  I will then begin my commentary on Move 8.} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 {7. ..... Kd7 - forced move.  This allows Fou Leblanc to win back a knight with Be6+.} 8. Be6+ Kc7 {8. ...... Kc7 - with a pawn on c6 this response is the popular one.  The other alternatives are Kd6 (not good because it does expose the BK on the open d column) and Ke1 which could allow repetition.  Black must be careful after white whips off the black knight because my steed on g5 threatens to deliver a Royal Fork on e6.} 9. Bxg4 Kb6 10. Ne6 {10. Ne6 - this knight move is designed to make life very awkward for black to develop his pieces.  After this, quick development on the part of white is required in order to go for the jugular, in this case the BK.} Qe8 11. Nc3 Nd7 12. d3 {12. d3 - opens up the c1-h6 diagonal for Fou Lenoir.  He could now go straight to e3 next turn to give a check on the BK exposing him still further.} Nc5 13. Be3 {13. Be3 - development and pin.  Now Henry has a choice of where to go.  Kingside or queenside castling.  I now delay the castling because I can win the knight on c5 getting enough material for the Wicked Witch of the West.} Ka5 14. Bxc5 b6 15. b4+ {15. b4+ - this move drives the BK back to a6 to face a Family Fork by my e6 knight moving to c7 with check.  Note, if Julian (black) had not played b6 on his 14th move that check would have been mate!} Ka6 16. Nc7+ Kb7 17. Nxe8 Rxe8 {17. ...... Rxe8 - after all this I have a huge material plus of 6 points.} 18. Bf2 e5 19. Nxe4 exf4 20. O-O {20. 0-0 - Finally Henry goes kingside to escape from the pin of the e8 rook.  I am contemplating putting Fou Lenoir on d4 soon to hit out at g7 and uncover a rook attack on the pawn on f4.} Bxb4 21. a3 Be7 22. Bd4 c5 23. Be5 {23. Be5 - Fou Lenoir bears down on the pawn on f4.} Bd8 {23. ...... Bd8?? - this loses a R for N and black is already heavily down on material.} 24. Nd6+ Ka6 {24. ..... Ka6 - this move allows #4 and I announced it to my opponent after playing my next move, 25. Bc8+.  Julian was given the option of resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate and he took it.  I will not give the moves that result in the checkmate but you could send me an e-mail and I will let you know if the answer is correct.  It is good to weave a mating net around the enemy king, especially late in the game sans Glenda.  I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now.  Joanne} 25. Bc8+ {}
