1. e4 c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ {Keeping momentum to apply the pressure that is given by the queen sacrifice.} Kd7 {The only move available} 8. Be6+ {Black has a number of places to move. Let's see where black goes} Kc7 9. Bxg4 {Taking back a knight. Just a slight loss in material now} Qe8 {Black avoids the knight fork that was coming next.} 10. Ne6+ {More pressure on the king} Kb6 {Black moves the king to a somewhat secure location, in the sense that it avoids an immediate check on the next move, in the hope of allowing further development} 11. Nc3 {Knight moves out to a position where more pressure can be applied. Considering 12. Na4} a5 {Black starts to create some retreating space for the king whilst removing b4 as an attacking location for white} 12. Na4+ {Ignoring the free pawn on e4 white chooses Na4 - more pressure on the king} Ka7 {Retreat to a7 by black in the hope of making some more space when the knight is freed.} 13. Nc7 {Fork the Queen and Rook - Let's try to make up some material} Na6 {Black frees the knight with the loss of a Queen. Once can't help but feel that this is the turning point} 14. Nxe8 {The Black Queen has been taken, with the sacrifice of a Knight. Material has swung the other way} Rxe8 {The inevitable loss of the knight.} 15. d3 {Freeing a path for the dark squared bishop to put more pressure on the king} exd3 {Expected.} 16. Be3+ {More pressure} Kb8 {Expected.} 17. cxd3 {Taking back a pawn to avoid further advancement. Unfortunately allowing Black some much needed time to consolidate position and prepare for a counter.} h5 {The counter begins with an attack on the light squared bishop.} 18. Be6 {Safe bishop position.} Rd8 {Black tries to claim the d file.} 19. Rd1 {Protect the d pawn} Rd6 {Bringing the lsb under attack again.} 20. f5 {Protecting the lsb, simultaneously allowing greater freedom to the dsb, particularly making a pin of the rook possible unless action is taken to prevent.} Nb4 {Pushing forward with the knight; considering a fork on the king and dsb??} 21. Bf4 {Remove the fork and most importantly pinning the rook. The rook is gone now. Black resigned here. The game was far from over though and I feel had black continued it might have turned into an interesting end game.}
