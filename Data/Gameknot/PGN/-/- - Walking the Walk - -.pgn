1. e4 {This is a game within the "Walking the Walk" club.  The idea is to give a lower- to mid-level player an opportunity to play a chess master.  (For these purposes, a "master" is someone on gameknot with a rating above 2000.)  The master initiates the game and plays Black.  I play White.} g5 2. d4 Bg7 {I had never seen this defense before.  When I told easy19 this, his comment was "I'm not defending."  :-D  I did a little research on it - I'll call this a modified Modern Defense (aka Robatsch Defense); normally the black g-file pawn is on g6, not out there on its own like this.  (The GK computer analysis considered 2...Bg7 a mistake and claims I should have taken the offered g-file pawn, but I thought it a waste of time.)} 3. Nc3 {I choose to take an idea from the "Monkey's Bum Deferred" (an attack to the Modern Defense), although I will not castle kingside.} h6 4. Be3 d6 5. Bc4 Nc6 6. Qf3 {I threaten the f7 square.} Nf6 {Black blocks access to the f7 square and puts pressure on the e4 pawn, also weighs in on the d5 square.  Currently, Black has more kingside space, but White has more central space and is ahead in development.  Note the huge risk for White castling here (7.O-O-O?), as the white queen's rook and the queen are on the same diagonal, and Black can land his light-squared bishop on g4.} 7. h3 {Keeps Black's light-squared bishop off of the g4 square.} O-O 8. O-O-O {I seriously considered 8.d5!? - an aggresive move that puts the black queen's knight in a tough spot.  But I thought it wiser to castle queen-side.} Bd7 9. Nge2 {Adds extra protection to the middle as well as getting the king's knight developed and out of the way of the rooks.  My plan at this point is to work toward a king-side pawn attack, but it seems too early yet to play something like 9.g4.} a6 10. g4 {beginning the pawn advance} b5 11. Bb3 {This keeps my bishop active on the important a2-g8 diagonal.  He may follow with ...Na4, but it will cost him an extra tempo to follow it with ...Nxb3, which gives me more time to attack the black kingside.} b4 {Instead, Black takes some nice space on the queen's side, and I'm the one losing tempo.} 12. Nd5 e5 {Now the battle in the middle gets interesting.} 13. h4 {a crucial move: I decide to begin trying to pry open the h file} Nxd4 {What was so interesting in this game was how seldom I could predict what the master was going to do next.  (I'm typically less often surprised by my opponent's moves.)  I spent a TON of time analyzing my 13th move, and of all the Black responses to 13.h4 I examined, I didn't even consider this one.} 14. Nxd4 {My backward knight is doing nothing but defending the d4 square, so I might as well spend it.} Nxd5 {Could this be Black's first mistake of the game? (That's what I thought at the time, but see move 16 below.)} 15. Bxd5 {Seems best to give my bishop a powerful spot in the middle.} exd4 {as expected (although I analyzed the alternatives like ...c6? 16. Nxc6, which all looked bad for Black)} 16. Bxa8 {In retrospect it was apparently Black's intent all along to get to this kind of position (i.e., his 14th move was not an error, and I fell into a nice little trap).  He complemented me on the maneuver but pointed out the rook was a bit of poison for my position.  Better probably would have been 16.Bxd4, but I couldn't resist the delectable rook bait.  (Later addition: The GK server also considered Bxd4 best, and it calls my choice an "inaccuracy", but I think it was a worse mistake than that considering the critical nature of the position.)} dxe3 17. Bd5 exf2 18. Qxf2 Qe7 {Must watch for ...Qe5, where Black has the queen backed up by the bishop along the long diagonal threatening mate (if I first move Kb1) or at least a king attack.} 19. Qg3 {19.hxg5!? looked like an interesting alternative.} c6 20. Bc4 Qxe4 {The black queen is a monster in the center of the board.} 21. Bxa6 Be5 {Black provokes a nice little dance of the queens.} 22. Qd3 {Since the black queen was both playing effective defense and threatening a strong attack against my king, at the time I thought my attack chances improved with the queens exchanged out.} Qxd3 23. Bxd3 {The computer analysis shows Black chose well in taking the offered queen exchange.} Bxg4 {Black evens up in material, and my chances of cracking through on the king's side now look slim.} 24. Rdg1 f5 25. Kb1 {avoiding a powerful forcing move by the Black DSB (25...Bf4+).} Kg7 26. hxg5 h5 {I am feeling completely lost in what to do at this point.  Black has closed up any attack path to his king.  Furthermore, the black bishops are imposing, both defending against my attack and keeping my king locked in place.} 27. Rge1 {I considered going after the Black DSB - desperate, I know.} Kg6 28. Be2 {A decision to swap out the LSBs is the best I can come up with at this point.  (The GK server analysis shows I had several mistakes / inaccuracies around here.)} f4 29. Bxg4 hxg4 30. Rh4 g3 31. Rg4 {And here's the big blunder that throws away the game (although to be fair to easy19, I was already significantly behind at this point).  What was I thinking?} Kh5 32. c4 Kxg4 33. Kc2 f3 {The paired Black forward pawns (f and g files) are a powerful combination - with one guarded by a rook, the best I could hope for is to take out one while the other promotes, and even this might cost me my rook.} 34. Kd3 {My thinking was to get my king involved by moving him near the center.  (The GK server shows a final blunder of mine here puts me into a mate path.)} f2 35. Ke2 fxe1=N {Easy19 makes an interesting promotion choice.} 36. g6 {I didn't want to give up, so I played through and watched how he would checkmate me.  } Nc2 37. Kd3 Rf2 {Easy19's comments after this move: "we got a cool mate with a knight now 38.c5 d5 39.a4 Kf3 40.a5 Ne1#  or 38.b3 Kf3 39.c5 d5 40.a4 Ne1#"} 38. c5 {My extensive analysis showed he was right - the best I could hope for was mate in move 40.  Anything else I looked at (starting with Ke4, a4, or g7) is an even quicker mate (all give Black mate in move 39).} d5 39. a4 Kf3 40. a5 Ne1# {and there's mate}
