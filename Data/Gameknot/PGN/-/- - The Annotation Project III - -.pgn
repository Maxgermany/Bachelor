1. e4 {A bit late to be annotating this one but hopefully the process will still be helpful... The real business starts at move 7 in this project.  Jo is a long-time adversary, who has a big plus score against me, so I'm glad I took my opportunities here...  } c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Qe8 {This seems to be the most popular and effective move here, though her majesty does get stuck awhile.} 10. Ne6+ {This too is the most popular move.  The knight really clogs up Black's position.} Kb6 {I think I tried ...Kd6 in another game and got short shrift for my trouble.  This seems much better.} 11. Na3 {There is a good case for preceding this with 11. a4.  11. d3 is also popular.} a6 {Black creates a hole for his K.  The computer prefers 11....a5, leaving the king and knight to argue over a6 and taking control over b4.} 12. d3 {So White aims to cover it with 13. Be3+} Nd7 {Black hastens to develop what he can and cover c5.} 13. Be3+ c5 14. b4 Rc8 {Each has 3 pieces defending c5 but Black can't sustain this indefinitely.  The computer prefers 14...Ka7, making no pretence to defend c5 or develop the R.} 15. Nc4+ {?  the computer sees an altogether more devious plan, whereby the b4 pawn creates havoc in Black's defences and the knights grab more material on f8: 15. bxc5+ Ka7 16. c6+ Kb8 17. cxd7 Qxd7 18. Nc4 exd3 19. Ne5 Qd5 20. Nxf8 Rcxf8 21. Nd7+ Kc7 22. Nxf8 Rxf8} Ka7 16. O-O {This appears to make White's king safer and brings a rook into the action but it also creates opportunities for Black to counter-attack.  The computer prefers the more thematic 16. Nxc5.} h5 {Black immediately launches a pawn towards the castled king, forcing White to decide how to redeploy her bishop.  The computer prefers the more consistent 16...b6, defending the c-pawn.} 17. Bh3 {On here, the B is bereft of decent squares but continues to support the knight on e6.  17. Bf5 or 17. Be2 were both interesting alternatives.} Rh6 {Black's developmental choices are distinctly restricted, so this move is not as odd as it may look.  The computer prefers Black to clear off the central pawns first, rather than leave the e-pawn hanging.} 18. bxc5 {White cashes in on the pawn.  Jo is never shy in accepting largesse and usually likes to equalise materially in these games as soon as she can.  At this stage, Black is still 2 points up.} Rc6 {Now it looks like Black plans to return those points by giving up the exchange.} 19. f5 {White reinforces the knight and threatens the Rh6 at the same time.} Rf6 {I'd originally planned to put the Nd7 there, so this is a bit of a compromise.} 20. dxe4 {Now White grabs another pawn and opens up another file.  With the B on h3, though, it will be a while before White can also exploit the f1-a6 diagonal.} g6 {Black's turn to attempt to open a file and free up his B.} 21. Na5 {The computer has White's advantage gradually increasing  here.  Now Black has awkward choices.  I decided to concede the exchange for a pawn to get rid of one of the pesky knights.} Rxc5 {? The computer prefers 22...gxf5.} 22. Bxc5+ {or bishops ...  The computer identifies this as a mistake because White doesn't gain as big an advantage as she would have done with 22. Nxc5: Best: -4.38 » 22. Nxc5 Nxc5 23. Bxc5+ Ka8 24. fxg6 b6 25. Rxf6 exf6 26. Bxf8 Qxf8 27. Nb3 Qg7 28. Bf5 Kb7 29. Nd4 h4} Nxc5 23. Nxc5 {Now White is 3 points to the good.} b6 {At this point I commented that one of Freddy's "rules" for this project is that forks are a waste of time; but I thought his comment was aimed more at White than Black and that this looked like Black's best move in this position anyway.} 24. Rfb1 {White sticks to principles and leaves Black with the choice, threatening check on b7 whichever knight Black takes.  However, her better opportunity was to bully Black's misplaced R with 24. e5! when the R would either have had to retreat, wasting time and giving White's pawns a chance to dominate or give itself up for a pawn.} e5 {Black doesn't have to hurry to take a knight.  This move offers a better way of deploying the Bishop, now that the knight is gone from e6.} 25. Ne6 {The knight returns to e6 but the beast has been freed... Now Black must decide whether to equalise materially or do something else...} bxa5 {Money has it ...} 26. a4 {Not sure what this was intended to achieve but it leaves Black some nice squares.  The compute prefers backtracking with 26. Rd1.} Qc6 {At last the Queen can enter the fray to purpose, forking e4 and c2 while also supporting a possible ...Bc5+} 27. Ra2 {White's plan to double rooks is too slow.  Black is now winning.  Again the computer prefers Rd1.} Bc5+ {? According to the computer this is a mistake but, I think, a natural one for a human - finally a chance to activate that bishop!  It also induces a fatal error by White.: Mistake: +1.78 » … Bc5+ 28. Kh1 Bb4 29. Ng5 Rd6 30. Rg1 gxf5 31. Bxf5 Bc3 32. Nf3 Qc4 33. Ra3 Bb2 34. Rd3 Rxd3 35. cxd3 Qxd3 36. Re1 Best: +3.34 » … Qxe4 28. Nxf8 Rxf8 29. fxg6 Qxg6 30. Rab2 Qc6 31. Rb7+ Ka8 32. Bd7 Qc5+ 33. Kh1 e4 34. Be6 e3 35. Rd7 e2 36. Bf7 Qc6} 28. Kf1 {?? this blunders a piece away that White can ill afford.} Qxe6 29. Rab2 {?? The computer announces mate in 5 for Black now.} Qc4+ {I'd worked out the mate in 5 for myself now.} 30. Ke1 Qxe4+ 31. Kf1 Qf4+ {White agreed and waved the white flag, spelling out how mate was forced.}
