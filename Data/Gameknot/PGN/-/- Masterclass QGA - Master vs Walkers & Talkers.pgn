1. d4 d5 {Standard reply.} 2. c4 {Normal.} dxc4 {Still book, but a dangerous move, since it leaves the center to white. } 3. e4 {Standard.} e5 {Another thematic move, leading to a sharp game. } 4. Nf3 {Standard.} Nf6 {Even sharper.} 5. Bxc4 {Leaves e4 to black, but at a cost.} Bb4+ {Interposing a check for developement's sake. } 6. Bd2 {Somewhat unexpected to me, but of course white cares for developement, without leaving black the extra tempo we will have if Nc3. } Bxd2+ {More developement for white. } 7. Nbxd2 {e4 is defended, and three minor pieces are developed against one by black. It leaves d4 to black, though.} exd4 {Greedily taking the offered pawn.} 8. e5 {Putting the question to the black knight. } Ng4 {Alternate moves were: Nd7, Nh5, or Qe7.} 9. h3 {Another question.} Nh6 {The knight retires to the only possible square.} 10. Nb3 {Attacking d4. Compare white's to black's position...} c5 {Confidently, since if Nxc5, Qa5+, winning the knight. } 11. Qe2 {With threats on the e column.} O-O {Shielding the king. } 12. Rc1 {Now the c5 pawn can be taken. If the queen checks and takes the white knight, Bxf7+ and RxQ. } Nd7 {A manouvre that intends to develop the lsb on g7 while defending c5. } 13. Bd3 {Blocks the d pawn, attacks c5 and points to h7.} Re8 {Trying to take advantage of the Q/K line. I cannot remember what we thought about the c5 pawn.  } 14. O-O {Shielding the king and releasing the potential pin.} Qe7 {Piling up against the e pawn.} 15. Rfe1 {Overdefending the e pawn. } g6 {Defending h7 and preparing a possible return of the h6 knight into the game. } 16. Qe4 {Occupying a central square, avoiding the necessary b6.} Rb8 {Fighting to play b6.} 17. Qf4 {A covered fork on Nh6 and Rb8. } Nf5 {Preferring to open the king's position instead of defending the knight. } 18. Bxf5 {Opening black's king defence. } gxf5 {Accepted.} 19. e6 {Forcing black to...} fxe6 {The only possible move. } 20. Nxc5 {The d7 knight is stuck to the defence of Rb8, so white can take c5.} Nxc5 {Black accepts the exchange dawn.} 21. Qxb8 {Of course. } Bd7 {Putting the question to the queen and finally moving the lsb. } 22. Qg3+ {A check that allows white to win another tempo. } Kf8 {Considered better than Kh8 due to Qe5+, winning the knight.} 23. Nxd4 {Destroying black's outpost. } Ne4 {Mixing up things. It shields the d6 pawn.} 24. Qe5 {Threatening Qh8+.} Kg8 {We were at a loss, so easy played the best possible move. } 25. Rc7 {Multiplying the threats.} Nd6 {Trying to hold. } 26. Qg3+ {Check again to free the R/N action on d6.} Kh8 {Kf8 or Kf7 had their counters, too. } 27. Rxe6 {Breaking black's defences. Black resigns. }
