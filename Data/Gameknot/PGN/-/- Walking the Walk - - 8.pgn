[Opening "Reti (A04), Herrstroem gambit"]

1. Nf3 { I have always like the Reti. 1.Nf3. After making my first move, I noticed a game between Freddy and Joanne, where Freddy states, "In my opinion you should not play this line against anyone above 1950 rating." Get the game in the comment below.  So now I'm thinking "Should I have played 1.d4 instead?" On one hand I am playing an opening that Freddy suggests I don't play. On the other hand, I do have his game against Joanne as a reference, so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for. I will review and analyze that game before playing further.} g5 {1...g5!?  Upon playing 1.Nf3, I said to Freddy, "Let's play the Reti!"  He responds, "A good and sound opening, lets make it unsound!". Thus the move 1...g5.  So I have reviewed the game mentioned in the last move, between Joanne and Freddy. He made the same move here that he made against Joanne.   According to the Game Database, this is called the Reti (A04), "Herrstroem Gambit", which I have never heard of before. Obviously Freddy is very acquainted with this. Uh-oh!   So looking up various other references, along with the GK Game Database, I find the gambit is seldom played by most masters. When it's played, they see the need to take that pawn! The GK World Database only has 3 games, all of which include 2.Nxg5. The website 365chess only shows this move in the big database, not the master database. There, 11 out of 14 games have the gambit accepted. Wikipedia, which gives a summary of all the openings and defenses (or so I thought), does not reference this Herrstroem Gambit at all.  I also feel that the g-pawn will cause me major problems if I don't take it. So in agreement with the masters...} 2. Nxg5 {I accept your offering, Mister Master Mater Freddy!} e5 3. d3 {3.d3. In Joanne's game, she played 3.d4. It's also the only move made by the masters on GK database. So in avoiding 3.d4, I automatically put myself out of the GK Master Database. I still have the GK regular database, but that may not be much help since the games are those ranked 1600 and above. I stated previously, "I do have his game against Joanne as a reference, so maybe I can avoid some of the traps she may have fallen for." Yet after 3.d3, I won't even have that. So unless this position transposes back into a line the masters play, I am on my own, in uncharted territory!  On the other hand, I need to go beyond making the moves the masters play, and understand why they make their moves! My analysis says, "Set up a sound position, maybe a KID reverse, with Nf3, and g3. Hold on the pawn, if possible, but be ready to give it back if Freddy applies too much pressure. So 3.d3 hinders Freddy from playing ...e4 chasing my knight when I put him back on f3. Alternatively, develop quickly and be prepared to castle long, if need be, to get my king away from the open g-file. The pawns on f2, g3, h2 and the fianchettoed bishop will give the king a good deal of protection if I short castle, but not necessarily after he plays ...h5, ...h4, ...hxg3, giving Freddy two open files to his royal highness."} Nf6 4. g3 {4.g3. On 2nd thought, I am wary of bringing the knight back to f3 too soon as this will take development time. That knight will have moved 3 times, while I have no other furniture moved at all. I know how it is with these Master Mater guys: You give an inch of development, and they take the whole board! So if 4.Nf3 Bg7 or 4.Nf3 Be7 and black is ahead in development, with his king-side almost completely mobilized. Wait a minute, I thought black is supposed to be a half tempo behind...} d5 5. Bg2 {So Freddy starts an imposing pawn center and I begin my first assault on that center. I am thinking of 6.c4 and if ...dxc4 7.Qa4+ followed by Qxc4. That would leave me with a mild attack on his c7. Then possibly drop Queen Esther back to b3, for a double attack on b7 to keep the c8 bishop harnessed. All of that is supposing he does not chase away the knight with h6 somewhere along the way, or throw a different wrench in my plans.} Nc6 6. Nd2 {Adding support to c5.} h6 7. Nh3 {7.Nf3 e5! and the knight is very restricted!} Be6 {Now he prepares for Qd7 double hitting my knight!} 8. f3 {Normally, I would never make this type of move, but I need a place for my knight other than g1! I hate putting pieces back on their original  squares! I am in uncharted waters here!} Qd7 9. Nf2 {I am still hoping to long castle, but I have not made any headway in that direction.} O-O-O 10. c3 {Preparing for Qc2, Nb3, Bd2 and O-O-O. Most of it never did happen! } Kb8 11. Nb3 d4 12. c4 {He is way ahead in development, and I'm moving this pawn twice. But I can't allow him to open up the position!} Nh5 {12...Nh5!? I was thinking, "What is he doing?" I felt my position though bad, would not warrant a sac, so this knight has nowhere further to go! How wrong I was!} 13. e4 {13.e4 ?? I need to develop my queenside and castle! Bd2 would be more appropriate.} dxe3 e.p. 14. Bxe3 {So now I only need to move my queen! I never got the chance until I was forced to sac her!} Rg8 15. Nc5 {15.Nc5? I don't know what I was thinking. 15.Qc2 should be played. I suppose I was trying to trade to prevent his impending attack... } Bxc5 16. Bxc5 b6 17. Ba3 Nxg3 {To think that he prepared for this 5 moves ago!} 18. hxg3 Rxg3 19. Rg1 {19.Rg1? Deep Hiarcs states I should have moved 19.Bf1. The move I made left a pin had headaches trying to remove. } Rdg8 20. Kf1 {Now instead of long castling, I am forced to defend with my king! Uh oh!} Nd4 {Threatening Kxf3+!} 21. Ne4 Rg3xg2 {So if I take then Bh3, but what choice do I have? He is threatening RxR. If Rh1, then he has my king stuck on the back rank! Rc2 followed by R8g2!} 22. Rxg2 Bh3 {Bh3 as expected!} 23. Nf6 {Looking for some counterplay.} Bxg2+ 24. Kf2 Qf5 {Sacking his rook!} 25. Nxg8 {I accept!} Bxf3 26. Ne7 Qf4 27. Nc6+ {27.Nc6+? I missed the defending Bishop!} Bxc6+ 28. Ke1 Qh2 29. Rc1 Bf3 30. Qxf3 Nxf3+ 31. Kf1 Qg1+ 32. Ke2 Qg2+ 33. Ke3 Nd4 {I resigned as Freddy advised me of the forced mate threat (Qe2#). Yet I see it is not a forced mate as I have Re1.  Freedy, it's been a long while since we played and it is not fresh in my mind. I apologize, I was on vacation mode due to work and have not annotated until now. Can you refresh my memory, please? What was the forced mate?  Thanks a gain for the game, and for taking me way out of my comfort zone! Good Game!}
