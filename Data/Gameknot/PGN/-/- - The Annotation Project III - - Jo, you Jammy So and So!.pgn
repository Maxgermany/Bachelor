1. e4 {Hi everyone1  It has been a long time since I annotated my last game.   Ever since early June chess has taken a back seat for me as I have had to deal with the loss of a close friend to Secondary Lung Cancer.  My friend, Rita received the death sentence in early June and passed away on 27.7.10.  Her funeral was on August 17th.  I still miss her even now and I am at the moment undergoing bereavement counselling.  Amazingly I have still managed to make moves in my games but my rating has taken a bit of a knockback and I will be lucky to be able to hold on to my Class A status.  However, it is time to get my chess back on track and my first step is to annotate a game between my buddy, Steve, which ebbed and flowed all the way through until we reached a fascinating endgame which resulted in a Low Draw for me.  How did this happen?  Well, I will continue my commentary on Move 10 because the first 9 moves are the most popular moves in the MT although 7.... Ke8 has been a good choice for black in this MT.  Anyhow, before I go any further, here is the link to Gameknot Analysis for you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14262186&rnd=0.2819884328735607} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Qd6 {9. ..... Qd6 - ssss, the Wicked Witch of the West is attacking my f4 pawn.  What shall I do?  I know, a knight check ......} 10. Ne6+ Kb6 {10. ..... Kb6 - Steve's king is drawn into open waters, can I take advantage of this?} 11. Nc3 {11. Nc3 - early piece development is essential in this MT when playing white.} Nd7 12. Nxe4 {12. Nxe4 - might as well get a pawn back.} Qd5 13. d3 {13. d3 ..... has the dual purpose of opening up a diagonal for Fou Lenoir who will want to land on e3 next turn.} c5 14. Be3 {14. Be3 - as planned and I now clear the decks for Henry to go kingside or queenside whichever way I think best.} Rc8 15. b4 {15. b4 - an attempt to open some lines.} Rc6 16. bxc5+ Ka6 17. Nxf8 Rxf8 {17. ...... Rxf8 - I was reluctant to trade off the knight for the bishop but the knight was untenable on that e6 square.  At least I only have a material deficit of just -1.} 18. O-O {18. 0-0 - Henry decides, it's kingside.} Nf6 19. Be2 {19. Be2 - a cunning retreat, 2 bishops are nicely lined up against the BK.} h5 20. d4+ b5 {20. ...... b5 - the only move to avoid disaster.  This move clears a retreat for the BK.} 21. Nc3 {21. Nc3 - attacks the Wicked Witch and puts b5 under a lotta pressure.} Qe6 22. Bxb5+ {22. Bxb5+ - fork.} Kb7 23. Bxc6+ Kxc6 24. Rf3 {24. Rf3 - if it were not for that pesky black knight on f6 I would have had a really jammy pawn fork on d5.} Qc4 {24. ....... Qc4 - the Wicked Witch stirrs up a cauldron of trouble on that square, tying up my pieces on the third rank to defending each other.} 25. Bf2 Ng4 26. Rd1 g5 {26. ...... g5 - exploiting the pin on the f3 rook.  Notice it does not look as though the rook is pinned because it is defended by my g2 pawn, BUT, that rook is defending my knight on c3 so if that rook is exchanged then I drop the knight next turn.} 27. d5+ Kc7 28. d6+ {28. d6+ - my queenside pawns look vulnerable so I decided to exchange one of them.} exd6 29. cxd6+ Kd7 {29. ..... Kd7 - my passer is blockaded.} 30. Bxa7 Rxf4 31. Rxf4 gxf4 {31. ....... gxf4!! - this reply looks odd as it splits up the black kingside pawns, but that f pawn is gonna be a monster.   Gameknot Analysis told me that taking the rook on f4 was a mistake.  Gameknot suggested 31. Rfd3 as an alternative.} 32. Bd4 Ne3 33. Bxe3 fxe3 {33. ..... fxe3 - I will soon have to give up my c2 knight for that e3 pawn, tears!} 34. Rd3 Qf4 35. h3 {35. h3 - creating some luft for Henry.} Qf2+ 36. Kh2 e2 37. Nxe2 Qxe2 {37. ....... Qxe2 - just as I feared a few moves ago.} 38. a4 Qxc2 39. Rd5 Qxa4 40. Rxh5 {40. Rxh5 - off comes the black pawn on h5 - at least I have no more black pawns to face, just as well because even on her own, the Wicked Witch of the West can be positively evil!} Qf4+ 41. Kh1 Kxd6 {41. ....... Kxd6 - after this capture, provided I do not lose or move my pawns or lose my rook it is now down to the 50 move rule.  If the pawns stay in the same place and my rook is still on the board and Henry is not about to be murdered by the Witch then on Move 91 I can claim a draw.} 42. Kg1 Qg3 43. Kh1 Ke6 44. Kg1 Kf6 {44. ....... Kf6 - edging closer to the rook on h5 and forcing him to move.} 45. Rd5 Qb3 46. Rd6+ Kf5 {46. .... Kf5 - the BK moves nearer to Henry hoping to weave a mating net with his beloved spouse around him.} 47. Kh2 {47. Kh2??? - aargh - I must have been half asleep here!  Luckily my opponent misses it.  Gameknot Analysis flagged up Qb8 (pin) and then announced #9.  But Jo is a very Jammy so and so because Steve overlooked it!!!} Qc4 48. Rd1 Kf4 {48. ..... Kf4 and DRAW OFFER!!!  Even though I would concede a Low Draw on acceptance I was soooo relieved to get away with just a 3 rating point penalty.  Yup, I have much work to do to get the focus back into my chess.  Until then, bye for now - Joanne}
