1. d4 {Here is an interesting game between freddy and I.  Through White's 15th move, the moves were predetermined.  I was playing against freddy in another game and began discussing another one of my games that had just ended (http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12254551&fb=1&rnd=0.7325155933749681).  I mentioned that I had blundered a piece in a game and that I eventually resigned as the game became "hopeless."  Freddy asked if I would like to replay that game from the point where I first blundered, only he would take Black (I was Black in the original game) and I would take White (essentially Freddy is spotting me a Knight).  I accepted for two reasons--I knew the game would be a learning experience and for a brief time, I had a material lead over freddy.  [freddy gets credit for naming this game]} g6 {Black goes with The Modern Defense.  As I annotate through move 15, I will take on Black's perspective because in the original game, I was Black.  After move 15, I will be annotating from White's perspective.} 2. e4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nf3 a6 5. Be3 b5 6. Bd3 Nd7 7. a4 b4 {While there are a number of ways to go with The Modern, the moves of this game were relatively common thus far.} 8. Nd5 a5 9. O-O e6 {9...e6 chases the N and give Black a little space in the middle.  It also allows for Ng8 to have a choice of developing square.} 10. Nf4 Bb7 {As is common with the Modern, Black attacks the middle from the flanks.  } 11. c3 bxc3 12. bxc3 Ngf6 {In the original game (not this one with freddy), I looked to put pressure on e4 with 12...Ngf6.} 13. Qe2 Nxe4 {13...Nxe4.  In the original game, I was feeling good about myself.  I had attacked White's center, I was up a pawn, and I felt my development was adequate.} 14. Qc2 {14. Qc2  In the original game, I over-focus on my development.  I do not pay attention to the fact that Ne4 is attacked twice but defended only once.  I castle to further my development.} O-O 15. Bxe4 {15. Bxe4.  In the original game, as Black, I lost my Knight.  In this game, I am playing White, and it is freddy who has lost his Knight.} Bxe4 {15...Bxe4.  I asked freddy why he exchanged LSBs as he is behind in material.  He commented that d5 (my original move when I played Black) was probably best, but he wanted to escape the past game and enter into unknown territory.} 16. Qxe4 d5 17. Qc2 c5 18. Rfe1 {My general plan was to develop my pieces and work slowly toward exchanging down into an endgame with a material lead.  I wanted to maintain initiative as well.  This never seems to happen when I play freddy--well not yet anyway.} Rc8 19. Qd2 Nf6 20. Rac1 {I'm thinking that I should have moved Rab1 or Reb1 to seize the open file.  I seem to be playing to defensively, something that is easy to fall into when playing someone 600 rating pts better than you.} Ne4 21. Qd1 {I have no initiative at this point.} cxd4 22. cxd4 Qd7 23. Nd3 {I was eyeing placing a N on e5 but after the move I wondered if it would have been better to exchange Rooks.} Rxc1 {And then freddy decided to exchange rooks.} 24. Bxc1 Rc8 {I could see that a4 was in trouble as Black could move Nc3, forking Q and P while doubling the attack on a4.} 25. Nfe5 {I'm attempting initiative.} Qe8 {That's right, freddy is on the run, the game will be mine :)} 26. Bd2 {I went back and forth between Bd2 and Bb2.  I was concerned about Bb2 because it seemed like my B was just hanging out there.  As soon as I moved Bd2, freddy said I should have gone Bb2 and then he showed me why.} Nxd2 27. Qxd2 Qxa4 {Bye-bye pawn. :(   But I'm still up a material point :)} 28. Qb2 Bxe5 29. dxe5 Rc2 30. Qb6 Rd2 {My Q, sensing danger, immediately returns to assist.} 31. Qe3 Qc2 32. Nc5 {32...Nc5?  Sadly, my Knight had no idea about the danger and had decided to go visit freddy's King.  I continue to work on my tactics and I see improvement, but I'm still prone to errors.} Rd1 33. Nd7 {33...Nd7??  I think I had a dream wherein I went Nf6+ and then working my Q down to Black's King.  I sometimes wonder how I maintain the ranking I have.} d4 34. Nf6+ Kh8 {It's really all over now.} 35. Ng4 dxe3 36. Nxe3 Rxe1+ 37. Nf1 Rxf1+ 38. Kxf1 Qd1# {In discussing "hopeless" games, freddy wrote to me:  "You learn most from a hopeless game when you keep playing and try to figure out the  best moves, checkmates, positional moves and more. Then your insight grows and your skill grows. And at some point you will notice that your former hopeless games are far from lost when you look at them again. In the end, the difference will be that you do not have to think about the solutions you will just know the solutions. So giving up such a game is a waste because it is the best learning experience. Ten hours of hopeless game time is worth 1000 hours of winning game time."  He wanted to impress upon me the importance of fighting on and learning, even when the game is hopeless.  As always, my thanks to freddy for taking the time.}
