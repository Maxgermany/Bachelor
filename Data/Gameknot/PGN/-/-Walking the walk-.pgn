1. g3 {I really don't like this move to open. It seems like a very weak first move. I wish I had opened Nf3 instead, seems to give me the same options.} c5 2. Nc3 d5 3. e3 {Really not liking the way my pawns look.} Nc6 4. Bb5 d4 5. Bxc6+ {Not sure about my decision to capture. Since my pawns were all jagged I figured a knight might be more valuable to him. In addition, he would double a pawn and that might be an advantage.} bxc6 {Doubled pawn} 6. Ne4 {So I threaten the unprotected (hindsight: with an unprotected)} f5 7. Nxc5 Qd5 {Now, I think I should have spent more time on my minor pieces. I have since been working the tactical exercises, but I didn't see the fork.} 8. Qf3 {Lesser of two evils, I give up on the knight and offer a trade, doubtful black will accept.} Qxc5 {He doesn't} 9. c3 {Trying to get my bishop out of there.} dxc3 10. bxc3 Nf6 11. d4 {Didn't see the fork at c3.} Qxc3+ 12. Kd1 {Didn't want to lose both} Ne4 13. Ne2 Qxa1 14. Ke1 e5 {Some thought I could castle by hand, but I really was just fleeing.} 15. Kf1 Nd2+ 16. Kg2 {And in my haste, didn't see the queen being threatened. Game is pretty much over, but I keep playing.} Nxf3 17. Kxf3 Qxa2 18. h3 Qd5+ 19. e4 Qxe4# {Thanks Dave for the game!}
