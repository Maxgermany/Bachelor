1. e4 {If you want to see the computer analysis with the game: go to this link http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14258262&fb=1&rnd=0.36723336512684035} c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ {Only justification for the Queen sacrifice} Kd7 8. Be6+ Ke8 {Buying time.} 9. Bf7+ Kd7 10. Be6+ Kc7 {?! I actually think 10...Ke8 is more safer than the move played. The best move in the last two projects 10...Kc6 is not playable due to the pawn,A reason why White has betterr counterplay for the sacrifice} 11. Bxg4 Qe8 {Another alternative is 11...Kb6. Both prevent the royal fork on e6 by the knight} 12. Ne6+ {White moves there anyway forcing...} Kb6 {the king to b6. The king is now trapped on the queenside. Both sides must be very careful in this position.} 13. d3 {opening the g1-a7 diagonal to the White DSB. } c5 {Black covers the check and opens room for the king} 14. b4 Na6 {!? Computer recommends taking the pawn on b4 but I do not think it is safe. The diagonal is opened again as well as the b-file.   The computer line goes 14...cxb4 15.Be3+ Kc6 16. Nd2 Nd7  an alternative to 16. Nd2 would be 16.a3!? I think this movee keeps in spirit of the opening. if 16...bxa3 17. Nxa3 followed by 18. Rb1 would be very uncomfortable for the Black player} 15. bxc5+ Nxc5 {?! but surely 15...Kc6 is better. The pawn would then restrict some of the open lines to the King and the King arrives on c6 as stated was better earlier} 16. Be3 Rc8 17. Na3 Qg6 {? This move turned out well, but with good play for White it is a disadvantage for Black.} 18. Rb1+ {? A mistake in reply, 18. Nc4+! gives White the advantage. 18...Ka6 19. Ne5! forces Black to give up the Queen with 19...Qxe6 20. Bxe6 Nxe6. Material is even but White has an development advantage and Black has an exposed king} Ka6 19. Nxc5+ Rxc5 20. Be2 Rxc2 {?! a very speculative sacrifice. again it worked in the game but White could've done better.  } 21. dxe4+ {? This is the reason the sac works.  but better is 21. Nxc2 exd3 (for some reason the comp does not want to take the pawn even though I think it is best.) 22.Bf1 b6 23. Nb4+ Kb7 24.Nxd3 is a pawn up for White.  but all hope is not lost for Black. His king is safe and White's pieces are all of the sudden all behind the 4th rank.  24...e6 is the best way to stay in. Now Black has possible threats like ...Qe4 and Bb4+ In a way the roles are reversed.} Rxe2+ {pretty simple really just get rid of the attacker} 22. Kxe2 Qxg2+ 23. Kd3 e6 24. Rhc1 {blunders the knight for nothing,Black should win this game} Bxa3 25. Rc4 b5 {attacking the rook and creating more space for the King by closing the b-file} 26. Rc7 {I really expected 26.Rc6+} Ra8 27. Rg1 {?? Mate in 6} Qxa2 {? But wait! Black doesn't see it! 27...Rd8+! finishes him off 28. Rd7 Rxd7+ 29. Bd4 Qf3+ 30. Kc2 Qxe4+ 31.Kb3 Qxd4 32.Kxa3 Qc3#} 28. Rgxg7 {alas,the fight continures} Qb3+ 29. Ke2 Ka5 {understanding the pawn is a goner and avoiding 30.Rxa7+ Rxa7 31.Rxa7#} 30. Rg5 a6 {the pawn is now safe} 31. Rc6 Rd8 {? unthinkable! Black gives the rook back. My play was not very convincing in this game. At this point I thought I lost the win} 32. Bb6+ Ka4 33. Bxd8 Qb2+ 34. Kf3 a5 35. Rb6 Qc3+ {? little did I think that I could win the Bishop! 35...Qb3+! If 36. Kg4 Qd1+ and if King moves to second rank. 36. K?2 36...Qc2+ 37. King moves to the third rank Qd3+} 36. Kg4 Qd4 {alas,I thought this forked but White has} 37. Bc7 Qg1+ {Giving checks White's King is on the run now.  Now we have another situation. Two rooks for a queen and a pawn. Black has two passers on the Queen side but White can create a passer in the center. So now it comes down to who can mate first or who can get their pawn to the Queening square. Most likely the latter.} 38. Kf3 Qf1+ 39. Kg4 {It is better to move 39.Ke3 Now the King will be stuck on the g and h files} Qg2+ 40. Kh4 {40. Kh5?? Qh3#} Qxh2+ 41. Kg4 Qg2+ 42. Kh4 Be7 {Now the rook is pinned and Black regains the advantage due to the mistake on move 39. But can he keep it?} 43. Rxe6 {? Another mistake although I thought he was just trying to gain material} Bxg5+ {?! Black can seal the deal by 43...h5! using the same motive on move 40. 44.Kxh5 Qh3+ 45. Kg6 Qxe6+ 46.Kh5 Bxg5 wins handily for Black} 44. fxg5 Kb4 45. Bg3 a4 {make way for the a-pawn!} 46. e5 Qe4+ 47. Kh5 a3 {the pawn continues its march} 48. Rf6 a2 49. Rf4 {doesn't matter anymore} Qxf4 50. Bxf4 a1=Q {Black wins,the rest is without annotation} 51. Kg4 Qb1 52. Kg3 Qf5 53. Kf3 Kc4 54. g6 hxg6 55. e6 Qxe6 56. Kg2 b4 57. Bg3 b3 58. Bf2 b2 59. Bg3 b1=Q 60. Bf2 Qg4+ 61. Bg3 Qb2+ 62. Kh1 Qh3+ 63. Kg1 Qbg2# {so it goes to show you Black can defend. While my play wasn't very convincing,White can't make a mistake while attack. Comments are welcome along with pointing out mistakes in my analysis}
