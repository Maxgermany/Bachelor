1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. e3 d5 5. c4 e6 6. c5 {Just to play differently.} Nbd7 7. Qc2 {Looking for c6.} c6 {Ok, but now black is a little cramped. I didn't have time to take accurate advantage of it. } 8. Bd3 {Just in case of any attempt of e5 in the future. Maybe Be2 is more accurate. } a5 {I thought about Qa5+, instead. } 9. a4 b6 {Of course, trying to free himself. Now I have to react.} 10. Ng5 {Putting a question on e6.} Nxc5 {?! It improves black's position, but Nb8, even if it looks terrible, was better. Na3-b4 was a good  plan for black. I don't have anyting in the inmediate future. } 11. dxc5 Bxc5 12. O-O {If I castle, it means I am planless. } O-O 13. Nf3 {Better was to develop Nd2, for instance. I was looking for the black squares. } h6 14. h4 {This was a mistake. If g4, Be5 was ok. } Ne4 15. Be5 {With some perspective of exchange the knight and align my queen on the black diagonal. In a few moves.} g5 {Of course!} 16. Nd4 {Crazy and bad, but with no time, you attack. } g4 {Not good, since taking h4 provides an useful open column to black. } 17. Nxc6 {g3 was natural. As always, I go wild and crazy. You don't want to exchange your beloved black bishop for my knight? Ok, you'll regret it. } Qxh4 {Wonderful, I was soooo clever! Now I am really near to mate. } 18. Bxe4 {I can't allow this knight to be there. } fxe4 {f2 is protected, for now. } 19. g3 {I calculated quickly that a queen on h3 is better than his pawn... but it was not necessary, since I have my bishop guarding g3, too. } Qh5 20. Bf4 {Or Qc3, probably better. Anyway, the mating squence Bh8 - Qg7# was easily stopped, so why to go for it? Better to have room for my knight. Ne5, Qe2, and I threated g5, releasing the pressure. } Bb7 21. Ne5 Rf5 {With a wicked plan I didn't see at once: Qh3, Rh5, and mate. } 22. Nd7 {Very stupidly. But I had to defend the knight, my only active piece!} Qh3 {Here he goes.} 23. Qe2 {Planning to go back to e5 and threat g4. } Rh5 {Looking for his mate plan, overlooking the simple...} 24. Nf6+ {If i had taken the bishop the move before, I would have been dead. } Kf7 25. Nxh5 d4 {Trying to complicate things. } 26. Qd2 {If dxe, Qd7+, forking the bishop. } Qxh5 27. exd4 {A horrible blunder.} Bb4 {Fortunately, he didn't see e3!, winning at once. } 28. Qe3 {Just the only one!} Rc8 29. Be5 {Nc3 was playable, since BxN, bxN, Rxc3 is impossible due to QxRc3, and if e3, Qc7+ winning the bishop! But I didn't see it, and went for this one, looking for Qf4+, looking for the opportunity to create some trouble. } Rf8 {Rc2 was better. Of course I cannot check, now, since I just help him opening the column to his rook. } 30. Nc3 {Developing the knight in move 30. A record!} Ke7 31. Nb5 {Going wild again. Not Nxe4, with a pinned knight. And overlooking...} Rf3 {Frightening, isn't it?} 32. Qc1 {Still, black doesn't have a clear mating combination. } e3 {Interesting, but...} 33. Qc7+ Kf8 {Just to take the bishop is not enough, because of e2. So I tried to take it with check. Of course, Bd6 was possible, but too defensive (the bishop exchange just takes away an active piece of mine. } 34. Qb8+ {And here black lost by timeout. If Qe8, the simple QxQ is followed by fxe3. But if the king moves, I take the bishop with another check and tempo. Anyway, I can free myself with f2xe3, winning. } Qe8 35. Bg7+ Kf7 36. Qxb7+ Qe7 37. Qxe7+ Kxe7 38. fxe3 Rxe3 {}
