1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Qd3 {e3 or Qc2 are much more common. On this square, the queen is subject to more attacks. } c5 5. d5 {This is looking Benoni-esque.} O-O 6. Bd2 {A passive move. Nf3 or e4 would have been improvements. } exd5 7. cxd5 d6 8. f3 {I understand that white wants to build a strong center, but this allows a dark-square weakness that can easily be exploited. } Nbd7 9. e4 Ne5 {Making a show of the bad placement of the queen and looking to make threats to the king. } 10. Qc2 Re8 {Setting my sights on the king early. White's development is poor and want to show its weaknesses. } 11. a3 Bxc3 12. Bxc3 a6 {I want to open the a7-g1 diagonal by pushing to c4, but I need the help of b5 first. } 13. Bxe5 Rxe5 14. Bc4 {A disastrous move. Ne2 followed by g3, Bg2 and f4 might have been the best course for white. } b5 15. Bb3 c4 {Opening the diagonal and blocking the bishop of the protection from the d5 square where I will make a tactical maneuver. } 16. Ba2 Nxd5 {White's poor development caused this to happen. White concentrated too much on gaining space with pawns that he forgot to foster the activity of his other pieces. } 17. Kf2 Qb6+ {Now the diagonal is used with strong effect. } 18. Ke2 Nf4+ 19. Kf1 Bb7 {Developing and trying to break open the center so my rooks can dominate. } 20. Ne2 Nd3 {Threatening mate and putting my knight in a very effective position. } 21. Nc1 d5 {The knight can be taken, but a strong attack follows. } 22. b3 {There is not much white can do. } dxe4 {White resigned. Black's rooks will soon blast into the king's sanctuary with the aid of the knight and queen. }
