[Opening "QGD Slav (D11), 3.Nf3"]

1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Standard queens gambit.} c6 {The Slav. I love playing both sides of this opening.} 3. Nf3 h6 {!? Not a good move, not a bad move. Personally, I like to develop my bishop to g5 on occasion and pin the f-knight, but this doesn't look to be the time to accomplish that.} 4. Bf4 {Developing piece number 2.} Bf5 {!? Again, not bad, but I was expecting the f-knight to pke it's head out by now.} 5. Nc3 {Piece number 3 activated.} dxc4 6. e4 {Dual threat. Not sure if this is the best way to recover the pawn, but it does force my oppenent to lose a tempo to deal with the bishop.} Bg4 {? A meaningless pin. The first truly poor move of my opponent. Better in my opinion is Be6, securing the pawn for at least another move. Still only one piece developed...} 7. Bxc4 {Recapturing and developing piece #4.} Nf6 {Finally pulling the knight out. And I spy with my little 1320 rated eye...} 8. Ne5 {Ne5!, winning the bishop at a minimum with 8...e6 9.Ng4. Having to eye the Queen with the deepest lust and not being able to take the Queen is a terrible endeavor indeed.} Bxd1 {?? What. Did my oppenent miss it completely?} 9. Bxf7# {# Pay attention, especially if you are underdeveloped and your opponent has massed minor forces in the center}
