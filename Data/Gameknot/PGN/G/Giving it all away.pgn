1. d4 {Interesting game against my online buddy, Tiddles. White loses this game in an orgy of sacrifices, when steady play was needed.} g6 2. e4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 Nf6 5. f3 O-O 6. Qd2 c6 7. O-O-O b5 8. Bh6 Be6 9. Kb1 a5 10. h4 b4 11. Na4 Nbd7 12. g4 Nb6 13. Nxb6 Qxb6 {So far fairly routine.} 14. h5 Rfb8 15. e5 {This move,15  e5!, ensures White's attack arrives first. } dxe5 16. dxe5 Rbd8 {Nice in between move.} 17. Bd3 Nxg4 {Black wants to do something to break up the attack} 18. Bxg7 {BxB?! is an attempt to complicate the attack when none is needed. Simply PxN, BxP is fine for White.} Nf2 {Why not?} 19. Rh2 Nxd1 20. hxg6 {Sacrificing the N} Qxg1 21. gxh7+ Kxg7 22. Rg2+ {Unfortunately, White has little else. } Qxg2 23. Qxg2+ Kh8 24. Qd2 c5 {Now if the N is taken the bishop is pinned. White resigns }
