1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 {Queen's Gambit Declined Exchange Variation.} 5. Bg5 Be7 6. e3 h6 {Deviating from the main line. Black typically plays 6.... 0-0 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. Nge2 Re8 9. 0-0 c6 10. Qc2 Nf8 11. f3. However, this usually favors White because he has two possible pawn breaks: A minority attack on c6 and a break on e4. While Black has much trouble with a c5 break.} 7. Bh4 O-O 8. Bd3 c6 9. Nge2 g5 10. Bg3 Bd6 {Forcing the trade of White's powerful darksquared Bishop which was important in his fight for the center.} 11. O-O {White plans on answering Bxg3 with Nxg3. This puts his pieces in the optimum postion for an e4 break.} Bg4 {?White gains a tempo by attacking the Bishop and preparing for an e4 break.} 12. f3 Bh5 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 {Trading Bishops. } 14. Ng3 Bg6 15. Bxg6 fxg6 {Doubling Black's pawns and trading off a key part of black's central control. White's Bishop had a nice post but wasn't doing much. He also has a lead in development so opening the center is to his advantage.} 16. e4 dxe4 17. fxe4 Qd7 {Preventing the fork.} 18. e5 Nd5 19. Rxf8+ Kxf8 20. Nge4 {Taking the Knight would have been bad as it would allow the black knight to be developed to a nice square and to allow him to take control of e4.} Qf5 21. Qf3 Qxf3 22. gxf3 {Trading Queens. Not great for white because it closes his open file and allows the black knight to develop to f4.} Nf4 23. Nf6 {Bringing the Knight to a nice square while stopping the development of black's knight.} Nh5 24. Nxh5 {Better is Nce4. Centralizing the Knight.} gxh5 25. e6 {? Premature. It does take away the d7 square from the knight. but white should have attained better control of e6 and e7 before moving his pawn there.} Ke7 26. Re1 Na6 27. h4 {White should play d5 and try to hold onto his e pawn. However, getting a passed kingside pawn is a good idea just not right now.} Nc7 28. d5 cxd5 29. hxg5 {White's only option.} hxg5 30. Re5 Rg8 31. Nxd5+ Nxd5 32. Rxd5 Kxe6 {White is a pawn down, however it is a rook endgame so he has drawing chances.} 33. Rb5 b6 {Attacking Black's queenside pawns.} 34. Rb4 Kd5 35. a4 {Taking the b5 square. a4 doesn't work as well because the rook is put in an awkward spot.} Rg7 36. Rb5+ Kc6 37. Kg2 {Protecting the f pawn.} a6 {Forcing the rook to move and to give up the b5 square.} 38. Rb4 Kc5 39. Re4 {Getting the rook to safety.} Kd5 40. Rb4 {White should tie all of black's pieces down to the defense of his pawns.} Rg6 {Defending the b pawn.} 41. b3 Re6 {Preparing to infiltrate white's position.} 42. Kg3 {Kf2 may have been better but this doesn't appear to hurt white badly.} Kc5 43. Rc4+ Kd5 44. Rb4 Rc6 45. Re4 {One of White's only moves.} Rc3 46. Rb4 Kc5 47. Re4 g4 48. Re5+ {Winning the h pawn.} Kd6 49. Rxh5 gxf3 {Better was. Rxb3 when black can get a queenside majority and win.} 50. b4 {! Creating perpetual check saving the game!} Rb3 51. Rh6+ Kc7 52. Rh7+ Kc6 53. Rh6+ Kc7 54. Rh7+ Kc6 55. Rh6+ Kc7 {Draw by three-fold repetition.}
