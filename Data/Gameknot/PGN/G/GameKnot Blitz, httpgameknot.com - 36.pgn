[Opening "Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 {Against this I'm at a total loss, so I improvise. Sometimes I try to fianchetto the lsb in b7, but it is not really a confortable game. So I tried something different. } e6 3. g3 c6 {Call me coward, but against a fianchetto, it is always profilactic to have a pawn chain. Specially against a higher rated player. } 4. Bg2 d5 {This seems to be just too much. I know I'll have problems to develop my queenside, but it's ok, provided white's game cannot break in. } 5. c4 {Now, if I allow c5, my game gets really cramped, so I have to get my dsb out quickly. } Qa5+ 6. Bd2 Bb4 {This assures me to exchange bishops, and not fear white's dsb to threat my knight on f6. This makes me able to prepare calmly the e5 break (or the f5 one).} 7. cxd5 {Uff, so it seems that cxd will help me to develop. But I wanted to play solid, and the semi open c column can become a kind of problem for me. Nxd4 allows inmediately e4, so...} exd5 {...and now my lsb is free. } 8. O-O Ne4 {I didn't want to lose a tempo, but I still wanted to force the dsb's exchange. } 9. Bxb4 Qxb4 {Threatening b2 (a weak threat, but it's ok as long as I don't move the lsb. } 10. Qc2 Bf5 {Ok, now I can move it, since no Qxb2 is in sight. And this threatens Nxg3 at once. } 11. Qb3 {Ah, this is the interesting part. Now, I cannot retreat the queen but in e2, and this will be annoying, so...} a5 12. Qxb4 {A mistake, as the rest of the game will show. } axb4 13. Nbd2 {Blocking b3, of course. Good: as black, and attacking!} Nd7 {Tempo to develop.} 14. Nxe4 {Well, Bxe4, and when the knight moves, BxB, was safe, but... boring!} dxe4 15. Nd2 {If Nh4, g6, and after the exchange, play for defending the 2 pawn's chain. Affordable, but this is better for me.} Nf6 {If f3, e3, Nd4, defending the advanced pawn. I'll probably lose it, since I have not castled yet, but...} 16. Nc4 {White opts for threatening an annoying knight penetration in d3. So, I "bravely"...} Ke7 {Interesting, isn't it? White cannot attack inmediately e4, so I felt this was safe. } 17. Rfd1 {Wise would have been Rh-d8. } Ra6 {...but I wanted to take advantage of my own free semicolumn. And if d5, after cxd my rook can get into the game again. } 18. Ne3 {Logic, but...} Be6 {This makes my threat on white's queenside really strong. } 19. b3 Rha8 {Renewing the threat. Now white has to lose a pawn. } 20. Nc2 {No use. Of course I cannot go Bxb3 at once. } Ra6xa2 {But this is enough to have a solid advantage. In a quiet position like this one, a pawn is all one needs. } 21. Rxa2 Rxa2 22. Nxb4 Rxe2 {THIS is the pawn I win, in the long term. True is that white has Ra1, but white cannot play d5 since I can take at ease, my e pawn is defended by the rook. Probably white could have tried something, but I cannot see the danger. Ra1, Kd7 and my king comes on time to defend b7. Not Rb2: if Ra1, Rb2, Ra7, Bc8, Nxc6 (b7 would be pinned). } 23. Bf1 Rb2 {Another pawn will fall. White is resourceless. }
