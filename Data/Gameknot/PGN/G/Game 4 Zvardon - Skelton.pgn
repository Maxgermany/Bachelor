[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Morphy defence, Duras variation"]

1. e4 {This game begins on the well-trodden path of the Ruy Lopez. But delving into a lesser known variation, White makes a risky move that triggers a violent attack against his own king. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. c4 {White's set-up has been played before and aims to clamp down on any future Black hopes of the freeing advance of his d-pawn to d5.} g6 7. Nc3 Bg7 8. O-O O-O 9. h3 {So what is there for Black to do? His opponent has an excellent grip on the light squares and has left Black very little room to manoeuvre. There will be a bit more space if a piece is traded. After that; Black has a set-up which indicates that he should aim to play f7-f5.} Nd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Ne2 Nh5 {There is no way to be sure that this is correct. Nevertheless, it looks a bit more active than other knight moves - and it is also a little provocative.} 12. g4 {[?!] White is a strong player and experience would have told him that this sort of pawn advance in front of a king can be risky. On the other hand; there appears no particular danger at this point and - when the knight retreats - he will have  made Black's idea of f7-f5 even more problematic.} Qh4 {[!] But now there is a problem: Black relies on the weakened king's position and is determined to create counter-play - even at the cost of a piece. I felt that, at worst, I could probably escape with a perpetual check if things did not 'work out'.} 13. gxh5 f5 {The obvious move was to play 13...Bxh3. But there is really no rush and the top priority is to open the f-file and add the rook to the attack.} 14. h6 fxe4 {[!] Taking my life in my hands here to some extent - but in fact this is stronger than moving the bishop. Anything else will allow White to play either f2-f4 or f2-f3 and organize a defence involving moves such as Rf2 and Qf1 for example.} 15. dxe4 {The best move: If White takes the bishop then he has to reckon on ...Rf3 which blocks his f-pawn. After that, Black now has three attackers [counting his c8 bishop], the white h-pawn is still en prise and there are  potential mating threats against both g2 and h1.} Bxh3 {I couldn't think of anything better than to start the threats.} 16. hxg7 Rf3 {I am not completely sure that this position is lost for White - but despite being two pieces up; it is obviously going to be difficult to defend.} 17. Qe1 {I think it was essential to return some material here and play either Nf4 or Bf4 and hope for the best.} Kxg7 {The pawn is captured so as to add Black's last piece to the attack.} 18. Qd2 {With the idea of exchanging queens - even with Qh6. } Qg4+ {side-stepping White's plans to simplify.} 19. Ng3 Raf8 {Note that now Black is threatening Rxg3 followed by Rxf1. So White moves the rook away.} 20. Rd1 Rxg3+ 21. fxg3 Qxg3+ 22. Kh1 Rf4 {[!!] This is the end: White has a few checks true: But my opponent knows that all they achieve is to remove his queen from the defence of g2. If White plays Rg1 here then the response is the final sacrifice ...Bg2+!! with a quick mate after either capture.}
