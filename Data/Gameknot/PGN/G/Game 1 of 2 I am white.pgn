1. d4 g6 2. e3 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. c4 Bd7 5. Nc3 {Nd2?} Bg4 6. Be2 Nf6 7. O-O O-O 8. Qd3 b6 9. d5 c6 {? i guess....} 10. Bd2 {I'm stalling , waiting for cxd5. always take last for a trade series} cxd5 {bingo.} 11. cxd5 Nbd7 {he locked his knights (that knight becomes annoying later on)} 12. Ng5 Nc5 13. Qc4 Bxe2 14. Qxe2 Bh6 15. e4 {I felt uneasy about this move. someting didn't look right about it. sure the pawn is heavily guarded, but I don't know...} Bg7 {I love forced retreats} 16. Rae1 {if i lose one guard, I lose control of the center of the board. } e5 {enpassent gambit? } 17. Qf3 {declined} Qd7 {I hate that queen. I also hate that knight: watch as I kill two birds with one pawn shaped stone} 18. b4 Na4 19. Nxa4 Qxa4 20. Qh3 Nh5 21. g4 {if I made one mistake. it was this and the next few moves. I obliterated my shielding pawn 'structure'} Nf6 22. f4 {ok. this was more of a mistake than the other one. but that knight has to go. I see (almost) no alternative. bc3 does not work because of d6. } Qxa2 {his turn to screw up. } 23. Re2 {I didn't want to take e5, it wouldn't work: so I stall for time with a counter to Qxa2, eventually i just say to heck with whatever black does and go for it. } Qc4 24. fxe5 {I forgot that this wouldn't work. Ironically, it does.} dxe5 {this is EXACTLY what I didn't want to happen.} 25. Rxf6 {like I said: the knight HAS to DIE. even sacrificing a rook at this point is good ftw. } Bh6 {and this was the game ending mistake.} 26. Qxh6 Qd4+ 27. Be3 Qd1+ 28. Rf1 {thank goodness for that rook. I was dead without it. } Qxe2 29. Qxh7# {all he had to do was Rfe8 to stay alive for one turn, but then 29... Kf8 Qxf7#. what did you think of game 1?}
