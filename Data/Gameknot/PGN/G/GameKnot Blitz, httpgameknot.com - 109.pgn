1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5 4. Nc3 Nf6 {First time as black using the slav exchange variation. Although it is less played against 1. d4 I more familiar with the different positions ensuing.} 5. Bg5 e6 {5. Bg5 is out of my book. I decide to preserve my pawn structure with e6 although Toga proposes Nc6. I like Bg5 as it gives the possibility to exchange a bad bishop for an active knight and mess with the black pawn structure.} 6. e3 Be7 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Be2 Nc6 9. O-O Qc7 10. Nb5 Qb6 11. a4 a6 12. Nc3 Qxb2 13. Qc1 Qxc1 14. Rfxc1 Bb4 15. Bxf6 gxf6 16. Na2 {Until here both side have an equal position (Toga gives -0.55 for black)} b5 {This move kills black advantage. Ba3 was prefered.} 17. Nxb4 Nxb4 18. axb5 Bd7 19. b6 Rab8 20. Rcb1 Rxb6 21. Bxa6 Ra8 {I managed to get out of a bad position with a chance to get even better but this move leaves both side equal. Rxa6 would have given black a good large advantage.} 22. Be2 Rxa1 23. Rxa1 Kf8 24. h3 Bb5 25. Bxb5 Rxb5 26. Rb1 Ke7 27. Nd2 e5 28. f4 exd4 29. exd4 Kd6 30. Kh2 Kc6 31. Kg3 Nd3 32. Rxb5 Kxb5 33. Kf3 Kb4 34. Ke3 Nb2 35. g4 Nc4+ 36. Kd3 Nxd2 37. Kxd2 Kc4 38. Ke3 Kc3 39. h4 Kc4 40. h5 Kb5 41. g5 {I only started to study the endgame. Toga gives this position -6.24 in favor of black. Sadly i missed the opportunity to keep the advantage. My idea was to keep my king in action trying to send him to the queenside to help the pawns when I should have followed the principle: Do not hurry and let white's king move out of the way or destroy his queenside. Preferred move f5!} fxg5 42. fxg5 Kc6 {This is the losing move. Kc4 would have killed white.} 43. Kf4 Kd6 44. Kf5 Ke7 45. Ke5 f6+ 46. gxf6+ Kf7 47. Kxd5 Kxf6 {Passed pawn with white king in front. Game over.} 48. Kc5 Ke6 49. d5+ Kd7 50. d6 h6 51. Kd5 Kd8 52. Ke6 Kc8 {Looking at this a month later, I realize how horrible this move was! Though I wouldn't have avoid the h pawn from queening...} 53. Ke7 Kb7 54. d7 Kb6 55. d8=Q+ Kc5 56. Kf7 Kc4 57. Kg7 Kc5 58. Kxh6 {}
