1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d6 3. h3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Nbd2 c6 6. e4 O-O 7. Bd3 Nbd7 8. c3 b5 9. a3 a5 10. e5 {I lost some edge in the opening, and I have to react someway. } dxe5 11. dxe5 Nd5 {Good move, but I needed to open the game a little. } 12. Bh2 Nd7b6 13. Qe2 {After much time thinking. I have to free my knight f3 from the duty of guarding e5.} Na4 14. Ne4 Nxb2 {Plain blunder.} 15. Qxb2 Nb6 16. Rd1 {Here, the situation becomes interesting. } Na4 17. Qb3 Be6 18. c4 {! bxc, Bxc, Bxc, QxB, the knight is en prise... not bad. } Qc7 19. Nfg5 {Blunder. It was better the other knight. I'm threatening NxB, c5xb6, and e6 is weak. } Bf5 20. cxb5 Bxe4 {Surprise! It was easy Bxe4, but then h6 would have kicked me. } 21. Qxa4 {I thought about b6, but Rb8 and that's was all. } Bxg2 {Ok, but now I can...} 22. e6 {The rook can't save itself because QxB, but the queen has to move, freeing my rook, and... let's see what happens in f7, please...} Bc3+ {Surprise! } 23. Ke2 {Rd2, BxR, KxB was not that bad, since white rides away of the black diagonal's guardian. } cxb5 {Surprise! Hehe, my opponent is defending as a lion! :-)} 24. exf7+ {Let's see what's happening up there. } Rxf7 25. Qb3 {Threatening mate. } e5 {Blocking my bishop and defending f7. This was a nice moment. I conceded my opponent (only -1 now) a post - maelstorm exchange as the dust sets down. } 26. Nxf7 Qxf7 27. Qxf7+ Kxf7 28. Rhg1 Bxh3 29. Bxb5 Kf6 {---but I cannot forgive this blunder.} 30. Rg3 Bf5 31. Rxc3 {The game is out of interest now, but I managed to get myself in some trouble anyway. } Bg4+ 32. f3 Bh5 33. Rd6+ {The wrong rook. } Ke7 34. Rd7+ Kf6 35. Rc6+ Kg5 36. Bxe5 Re8 {f4 is not possible... } 37. Rc5 Kf5 38. Rdd5 {A problem-like position... but no mate. } Ke6 {Last & definitive blunder. A game interesting for the strange midgame. } 39. Bxe8 {}
