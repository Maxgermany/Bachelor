1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 Bg4 4. Nbd2 e6 {Very normal London setting so far, with the Nc6 by black being a slight positional mistake. } 5. h3 Bh5 6. g4 Bg6 7. h4 Bb4 {A waste of time.} 8. c3 Ba5 9. h5 Be4 10. Nxe4 dxe4 11. Ng5 Nh6 {The best aswer being f5, trying to defend the central pawn. If I play the logical f3, exf3, exf3 is ok too, but I went for a more risky game. } 12. Nxe4 Nxg4 13. f3 Nf6 14. Qc2 {If he exchanges, centralizes my queen or I can build an impressive center. Bg5 was another good option, probably better. } h6 {which he correctly stops.} 15. O-O-O {I just adore castling when it is an attacking move. } Qd5 {Good. Now I go for one of my "crazy" moves...} 16. c4 Qf5 17. e3 {Now, Bh3 and the black queen is released to the sad h7.} Nxh5 {but I didn't see this one. Too bad. } 18. Bh3 Qg6 {Rg1 comes inmediately to mind, but... which one? I wasn't sure. I wanted to keep an eye on the knight, so I didn't want to go there with Rh. However, I must have assumed he will exchange it with my bishop. } 19. d5 exd5 20. Rxd5 {Played without thinking, because if cxd, the knight must fly, and Qa4+ makes me win a piece. } Nxf4 21. exf4 {It opens another nice column for my attack. Now he should have castled, no doubt. I have Bf5 in mind, however. } Rd8 22. Re1 {This cannot be bad. } Rxd5 23. cxd5 Nb4 {I can win a piece, but I have to mind Nd3+ forking my rook. And then, Qg1 provides him with countergame. } 24. Qa4+ c6 25. Nc5+ {Proud of this move, better than the double check, I think. } Kd8 {Kf8, Nd7+ and Re8 was not mate. Kh7 saves him.} 26. Nxb7+ {but this is mortal. Better than QxB, b6, Nb7+, Kc7 and holds. } Kc7 {Re7+ Kb6, and nothing is definitive. d6+ KxN d7 doesn't work. I have to check.} 27. Qxa5+ Kxb7 {Re7+ now was the good one. } 28. Qxb4+ Kc7 29. Re7+ Kd8 30. Rd7+ Kc8 {Ke8, Qb8#} 31. Qb7# {}
