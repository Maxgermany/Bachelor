1. d4 e6 2. Bf4 d6 {Very passive, but solid. } 3. Nf3 Nd7 {Black challenges me to take advantage of his passiveness. } 4. g4 {Accepted. } h6 5. h4 b6 {Good, this diagonal is always hard to control. } 6. e4 Bb7 7. Nbd2 Ne7 {Black should have taken its chance to go e5. } 8. Bg3 a6 {Another passive move. It's up to me. } 9. Bd3 {Nothing drastic, but g6 is a target. } g6 10. h5 {I know this will block the wing, but I had faith in a slower undermine of black's kingside. } Bg7 {Fortunately, my opponent didnt take the chance, and played this sensible move. } 11. g5 {My thoughts were: "anything in order to allow my queen to come out on the kingside."} hxg5 12. Nxg5 {Now, the black shield is strangely weak. But I made a sac here...} Bxd4 {It's ok, I have to tempt him wiht something in order to allow me build the attack. } 13. Qf3 {Here, my opponent panicked. } f5 {? Nf8 would have been enough, or Rf8. White has already the edge, but this is awful. } 14. Nxe6 Qc8 {I could win the bishop, but I wanted to go on with the attack instead... and I almost lost!} 15. O-O-O Ne5 16. Bxe5 Bxe5 {He has saved his bishop, and material is even. Now I have to show that I did it wisely. } 17. hxg6 {Losing a piece, but with a stunning attack. } Rxh1 18. Rxh1 Qxe6 19. Rh6 {Rh8 is impossible, but this is not bad, too...} Qxa2 {This can hardly be a problem, but I handled it too optimistically. } 20. Qh5 Qxb2+ 21. Kd1 {Black can go on with another check, then... nothing. } Kd7 22. exf5 {The two joined pawns are a powerful force, but it is hard to see how to exploit it. } Bg7 23. Rh7 {Black is tiying himself. } Re8 {Wiser than it seems at first sight. } 24. Ne4 {? Qg4 posed a hard to meet treat. The knight ought himself to the king's guard. } d5 25. Ng5 {I realized Qg4, but it was too late now. } Qb1+ 26. Kd2 Bc3+ {Black hopes to deflect my king to avoid more threats on the kingside. } 27. Kxc3 d4+ {Nothing to do. I won't bite it, and give you some chances. } 28. Kd2 Qb4+ 29. Kd1 {I realized black had perpetual check, unless I dare to move my king into a dangerous journey on the kingside... with blakc's lsb looking freely at it...} Kc8 {Unpinning the knight, black threats mate. The last chance...} 30. Rh8 {The more powerful and unexpected way to cope with the thread. } Ng8 {A very smart move, trheatening mate...} 31. Ne6 {And the activation of the knight as "umbrella". Black can try the perpetual once more. } Bc6 {Black activates the bishop, covers the Re8, and tries to add power and coordination to his pieces. Here, Qh7 was decisive... unless black's perspectives of perpetual check. } 32. Bxa6+ {This seems to be very clever. it isn't. } Kb8 33. Qh7 {At last, but better was one move before. } Bf3+ {This is another "coup of scene" I should have foreseen. Am I busted?} 34. Kc1 Qa3+ 35. Kd2 Qc3+ 36. Kc1 Be4 {I have to pay for my overconfidence. With a piece. } 37. Qxc7+ Qxc7 38. Nxc7 Kxc7 {Now, I should save my pawns, with Bd3, but it will be a lost fight. } 39. Bc4 {If I recover the piece... a drawn is still possible. } Nf6 40. g7 {The pawn is now on the seventh rank. Look what interesting tactic comes here...} Bxf5 41. Rxe8 {Black' can't take the rook, or my pawn queens. The game is technically won. }
