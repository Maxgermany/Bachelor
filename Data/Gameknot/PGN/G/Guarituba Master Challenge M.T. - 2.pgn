1. c4 {Write comments or rate the game if you want...} e5 {i played e5 to have more opportunities later...i don't think c4 help white at all.} 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. g3 d6 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. e3 Nc6 {i'm trying to be typical with no mistakes in the opening. } 6. Nge2 Nb4 7. d4 {d4 did not help white at all.} exd4 8. exd4 Bb6 9. O-O O-O {After 9 moves the game is still equal. Maybe he slightly has the upper hand. } 10. a3 Nc6 11. d5 {Bad move for me. he did not win anything and my horse's mobility rises.} Ne5 {With Ne5 my horse is becoming more energetic.} 12. b3 c5 {i wanted to have space in the centre.} 13. Bg5 h6 14. Bf4 Re8 15. Qc2 Neg4 16. h3 Ne5 17. g4 {g4 again is a bad move. a move with no reason.} g5 18. Bg3 Ng6 {now i wanted to sacrifise my horsie.} 19. Rad1 {The castle is moving with no reason again.} Nh4 {That is what i wanted to do.} 20. Bxh4 gxh4 {and now the h4 pawn is really strong.} 21. Nf4 Ba5 {i wanted to eat horsie } 22. Rfe1 Bxc3 23. Qxc3 a6 24. b4 b6 25. Re2 Bd7 26. Rde1 {worthless effort with the castles.} Ba4 27. Nh5 Nxh5 28. gxh5 Bd7 29. bxc5 bxc5 30. Bf3 {REally bad move. Now i'm starting my attack.} Qg5+ 31. Bg4 {bad defence. it would be better for him to move the king.} f5 {for me f5 is one of most important moves in the game. also white's queen is just looking and she's not participating at all.} 32. f3 fxg4 33. hxg4 Ref8 {THe castle is moving for support.} 34. Re2e7 {Bad move with no reason. instead he'd have protected his king better.} Rf7 {Typical reply.} 35. Rxf7 Kxf7 36. Qd3 {i really don't know what he's thinking.} Rg8 {i move the castle there for my king's protection.} 37. Qc3 {Definately worthless move again.} Qf4 {with that move i'm going for checkmate. Still his queen is sleeping.} 38. Re4 {No reason to do that as i'm going for check anyway.} Qg3+ {check and checkmate is so close.} 39. Kf1 h3 {this pawn made the difference remember?} 40. Re2 {Bad reply again. and also he's blocking his king.} h2 {i wanted another queen. } 41. Qe3 {now is too late.} h1=Q+ {and another queen and the game is over. ckeckmate with just a queen and a pawn. and then he resigned.}
