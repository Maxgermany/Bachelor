1. d4 {I start with my normal.} d5 {He replies conventionally.} 2. c4 {I opt for the Queen's Gambit.} Nf6 {This is inferior, as his knight gets kicked around. Better is e6 or c6.} 3. cxd5 {So I take.} Nxd5 {He takes back.} 4. e4 {I attack the knight, and seize the centre.} Nb6 {f6 was a better square, where he attacks the e pawn. } 5. Nc3 {I develop.} e6 {So does he.} 6. Be3 {Developing the bishop, and also discouraging c7-c5 which attacks my centre.} Nc6 {He attacks d4 again.} 7. Bd3 {If he takes on d4 now, I take back, and if he recaptures with the queen he loses it to Bb5 check.} Bb4 {Another inaccuracy as an exchange on c3 simply strengthens my centre.} 8. f4 {I prevent the other pawn break by him - e7-e5.} Ne7 {Not sure why he played this?} 9. Nf3 {I develop my last minor piece.} h6 {Again I think this is rather a waste of a move.} 10. O-O {I castle, bringing my king to safety and my Rh1 into play.} a6 {I mirror of h6 perhaps, but again, not helping his development.} 11. a3 {Now he is forced to take as Ba5 loses the bishop to b2-b4 and Bd6 to e4-e5} Bxc3 {So he takes.} 12. bxc3 {I take back.} Bd7 {and he finally develops his bishop.} 13. a4 {I want to drive back his Nb6. Maybe I can have pressure on the b file by moves like Ra1-b1 attacking b7, after his knight goes.} Bc6 {He puts the bishop on a more active square.} 14. c4 {With thoughts of d4-d5.} Qd7 {Attacking a4, but taking away a square from his bishop.} 15. a5 {I hit his knight.} Nbc8 {Which runs away.} 16. d5 {And now his bishop, which is running out of squares.} exd5 {So he takes.} 17. exd5 {Normally people are advised to take towards the centre, but it would be a massive mistake to take with the c pawn here, as it would give him b5 for his bishop.} Bxd5 {As he is losing it, he may as well get 2 pawns for it.} 18. cxd5 {So I take.} Nxd5 {he takes back, attacking Be3.} 19. Bc5 {I decide to sacrifice a pawn to prevent him castling.} Nxf4 {He takes it.} 20. Re1+ {I throw in a check.} Ne6 {His knight retreats.} 21. Nd4 {I put more pressure on his knight.} Kd8 {I find this a strange move.} 22. Nxe6+ {So I take.} fxe6 {He takes back.} 23. Rxe6 {I was really pleased to find this! Now if he takes, Bf5 discovers check from my Qd1 and hence wins his queen.} Nd6 {So he blocks the d file.} 24. Rxd6 {I decide to sacrifice the exchange for a mating attack.} cxd6 {He takes the rook.} 25. Bb6+ {I throw in a check.} Kc8 {The king runs. I have to find a good move, otherwise he may grovel out with Kb8 and Rc8.} 26. Bf5 {I sacrifice again, although after the game, checking the ending on Fritz, I found out that Rc1 also wins.} Qxf5 {He is almost forced to take.} 27. Qxd6 {Threatening mate on c7.} Qd7 {Qc2 is a tougher defence, but still loses to Rd1 check, threatening the queen sacrifice Qd8+, mating.} 28. Rc1+ {It is over now.} Qc6 {Forced.} 29. Rxc6+ {So I take.} bxc6 {He takes back.} 30. Qc7# {Only to be mated.  Many thanks for reading. Please rate this on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing.}
