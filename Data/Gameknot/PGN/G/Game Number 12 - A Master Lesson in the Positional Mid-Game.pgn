1. Nc3 {I'm unsure how often this is played, but where I play I haven't seen it before.  It seems a fairly logical move, developing a piece early on and pressuring the centre light squares.} c5 {So I played what felt natural to me.  c5 allows me to attempt to control the dark squares whilst ceding the light ones to White.  I figured that White would be forced to play either e4 or f4 to attempt to keep things even.} 2. f4 {As expected, White plays f4.} d5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. e3 e6 {Development moves.  Felt I was already beginning to gain a small advantage.} 5. Bb5+ {White makes his first attack, I think mainly to test the resolve of his unknown opponent.  I think I preferred d3, which although slightly passive would allow White to continue developing instead of wasting a tempo.} Bd7 {Better than Nfd7 or Nbd7 due to the direct challenge of the Bishop.} 6. Bxd7+ Qxd7 {White decides to exchange Bishops, which I think benefits Black more than it does White.} 7. O-O Nc6 8. d3 Be7 9. Qe1 O-O {Black still holds a slight advantage after both sides have castled.} 10. Qg3 Rac8 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. a4 c4 13. dxc4 dxc4 14. Kh1 Rfd8 15. e4 Bb4 16. Rac1 {Waiting move played by White.} Qb6 17. Rca1 Ba5 {Attacks White's vulnerable b2 Pawn and blocks the progress of the a4 Pawn.} 18. Rab1 Nb4 {Attacks White's Pawn at c2} 19. e5 Nfd5 {With careful play, I think Nfd5 could've worked, but the fact is this is the turning point of the game for me.  From here on, easy19 manages to get back into the match.  Perhaps Ne8 was safer?} 20. f5 exf5 {Isolates White's e5 Pawn.} 21. Nh4 {Double attack on Black's f5 Pawn.} f4 {Suddenly the game is slipping away from me.} 22. Bxf4 Qe6 23. Bg5 Bc7 24. Nxd5 Rxd5 25. Bf6 {White threatens checkmate, forcing Black to make another defensive move.} g6 26. Nf5 {Partial pin on White's Pawn at g6.} Nc6 27. Nh6+ {Check on Black's King.  Most of Black's pieces are incapable of defending, still positioned for the attack that was occurring on the Queen-Side, meaning White has complete control.} Kf8 28. Rbe1 c3 29. bxc3 Rc5 30. Nxf7 {White creates a passed Pawn on e5 with a Knight sacrifice.  A nice piece of play, which shocked me at the time thinking it was a mistake.  I think I'd have played Qf2 first, before playing Nxf7, but the shock effect of Nxf7 took a hold so was probably the better move.} Kxf7 31. Qf2 {As expected, White attacks Black's Rook on c5 and creates the possibility for a powerful discovered check.} b6 32. Bd8+ {Expected discovered check.} Qf5 {Forks White's Bishop and Queen.  It's worth noting that Kg7 and Kg8 led to mate in the next move (Qf8#), Qf6 led to mate in 3 (33.Qxf6+ Ke8 34.Qf8+ Kd7 35.e6#) and Ke8 was so ruinous as to be unplayable (33.Qf8+ Kd7 34.Rf7+ Ne7 35.Rxe7+ Kc6 36.Rxe6+ Kb7).} 33. Qh4 Bxd8 {Was this the correct decision?  In hindsight I'm no longer certain.  I was aiming at threatening the White Queen, basically following a simple rule I learnt early on when I started playing chess - "If you can take a piece, always take with the least valuable one".  However, I wonder if here things could've turned out differently if I'd simply seized the open-file with Rxd8?  I realise I'd be sacrificing my Queen either way, but I wonder.} 34. Qxh7+ {Isolates my Pawn at g6.  I had expected Rxf5+ first, with Qxh7 afterwards, but I guess the order isn't overly important.} Ke6 35. Rxf5 {Threatens mate again (Qf7#)} gxf5 36. g4 fxg4 {Isolates White's Pawn at h2.  Material is technically even, but White has a huge lead.} 37. Qg6+ Kd7 38. Qd6+ Ke8 {White manoeuvres the Black King into a favourable position.} 39. e6 {Advances the passed Pawn.} Ne5 40. Rxe5 Rc8c7 41. Rxc5 {Funny for me to say this, but I actually think Rxc5 was a slight error.  Not overly important, still a winning move, but I think Re1 was better.} bxc5 42. Qf4 Rg7 43. Qe5 Rh7 44. Qf5 Rg7 45. Qh5+ Ke7 46. Qh6 Kf8 47. Qh8+ Rg8 48. Qh5 Rg7 49. Qxc5+ Re7 50. Qd4 {Lovely set of moves, homing in on Black's Bishop.} Rxe6 {Better players will have already spotted why I had to abandon the Bishop here, for those that haven't seen it - 50...Ke8 51.Qh8# or 50...Bc7/Bb6/Ba5 51.Qh8#  The only feasible move I could see was to get rid of that dangerous e6 Pawn.} 51. Qxd8+ Kf7 52. Qd7+ Re7 53. Qxg4 Kf6 54. h4 {White has been busy creating space for the final offensive before pushing his passed h Pawn.} Rg7 {In hindsight, I wonder about this.  I realise by this point the game is lost, but I was looking to hold out as long as possible against a player that others have nicknamed "The Master Mater", so I wonder whether or not Re1+ might have allowed me to stretch it out a few more moves.} 55. Qd4+ Kg6 56. c4 Re7 57. c5 Kf5 58. c6 Ke6 59. Qd8 Kf7 60. c7 Re1+ 61. Kg2 Re2+ 62. Kf3 Rxc2 63. Qd5+ Kf6 64. Qg5+ Ke6 65. Qg6+ Ke7 66. Qxc2 {Mate in 3 - 66...Kf6 67.c8=Q Ke7 68.Q2f5 Kd6 69.Qcd7#} Kf6 67. Qc6+ {Unsure why this pleased me so much, but White missed it allowing me to last 1 extra move.  :o) 67...Kg7 68.c8=Q a5 69.Q8d7+ Kh8 70.Qa8#} Kg7 68. c8=R {Rubbing salt into my wounds, since he doesn't need the Queen he doesn't bother to get one.} a5 69. Rc7+ Kf8 70. Qa8# {And it's over.  A lovely game in which I hope I've learnt a few lessons on positioning my attacks.  Sorry that I couldn't do justice to Freddy's moves in this match, the fact is that even after the game with all the time I needed to analyse each position I still couldn't grasp the tactical decisions made.}
