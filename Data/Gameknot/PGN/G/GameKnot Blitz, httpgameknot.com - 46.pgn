1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Phillidor's defense.} exd4 4. Nxd4 h6 {?! I think this is unnecessary.  Neither Bishop nor knight is going to g5 anytime soon.} 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bd3 b6 {!? Weakens a6, c6, d5, especially since black never plays Bb7.} 8. O-O c5 {? This has to be a strategical error.  It leaves a backward pawn on d6 and weakens the light squares more. } 9. Bb5+ {Forcing the exchange of bishops, and his was the only defender of the light squares.  I also wanted to clear out the knight and bishop between my queen and his d-pawn.} Bd7 10. Nf5 {Adding a second attacker onto d6.} O-O 11. Nxe7+ {I played this because I thought that it would make the attack on d6 easier, and that I wanted to have a bishop over knight advantage, but in retrospect, this seemed like trading an active knight for a bad bishop.} Qxe7 12. Bxd7 {?} Nbxd7 {I overlooked this recapture.} 13. Re1 {Now if 13...Nxe4 14.Nxe4 Qxe4 Qxd6 and white looks good.} Rfe8 14. Bf4 Ne5 15. Nd5 Nxd5 16. Qxd5 {I captured with the queen to create more complications, which are favorable for me because I have more space.} Rad8 17. Rad1 Qf6 18. Bg3 Re6 {? Not only does this drop a pawn, but it also just plainly loses time.  I think something like 18...Ng4 is better.} 19. f4 {! Thanks to Black's last move, this is quite strong.  The knight can't retreat to g6 because of the fork.} Nd7 20. f5 {Attacking the misplaced rook while opening a line for the bishop.} Re7 {? Much better was Re8, getting the rook off of the dark square.} 21. Qxd6 Qxd6 {? Black was lost anyway, but this just drops the exchange.  After 21...Re8 22. Qxf6 gxf6 23. Bh4, black's losing another pawn.} 22. Bxd6 Ree8 {Forced because black lacks space.} 23. Bc7 {! Attacking the rook that defends the knight.  Black loses the exchange and rightfully resigned here.  I hope you enjoyed this game.  BTW, as this is my second annotation and I'm not quite clear on some gameknot terms, how do I use/where do I find the star rating system?}
