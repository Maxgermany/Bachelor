1. e4 {so Game 1 starts! } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 {The Giuoco Pianissimo, a very positional opening compared to the aggresive 4.c3!? 4.0-0 is also an option} d6 5. h3 {To prevent his Bg4-Nd4 ideas} h6 {He mimics} 6. O-O Qf6 {He goes out of book with this move.} 7. Be3 {Offering a bishop trade after which there will be discoveries on the f-file.} Bb6 {!? He wants me to open the a-file} 8. c3 {Of course I decline and i prepare the thematic d3-d4 break} Qg6 {threat: Bxh3} 9. Nh4 Qf6 10. Nf3 {I was 1200 at the tome so he didn't want a draw and he played...} Be6 {I decide to trade because d4 will be available after the trade plus he has no rook on the f-file} 11. Bxe6 Qxe6 12. d4 {Thematic in this type of positions.} exd4 13. Bxd4 {Attacking g7} f6 14. Qd3 Nxd4 15. Nxd4 Bxd4 16. cxd4 O-O-O 17. Nc3 {I have 2 centre pawns and better development so +=} c6 18.

Qc3 {this foces the exchange of Qs (otherwise Qc7+ Ka8 Qc8+ RxQ RxR#)} Qxc3 26. Rxc3 fxe4 27. Re3 exf3 {not a good move as i now trade and have a clear position with no Black counterplay} 28. Rxe8+ Nxe8 29. gxf3 Nf6 30. Re1 Kc8 31. Re7 {Attacking g7 and forcing...} Nh5 32. Kf2 a6 33. Ke3 a5 34. Ke4 Nf6+ 35. Kf5 {Black resigned because my king gets to g6,g7 and h6.
