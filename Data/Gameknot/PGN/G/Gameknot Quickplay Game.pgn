[Opening "Sicilian (B40), Pin, Jaffe variation"]

1. e4 {Again, this is a bit of a one-sided game against a weaker opponent, but I think it is quite a nice attack!} c5 {He plays the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence} 2. Nf3 {I head for the open variation. } e6 {This can lead to the Taimanov, Kan (Paulsen), Four Knights or Pin Variation.} 3. d4 {I go for the Open Variation.} cxd4 {He takes.} 4. Nxd4 {I take back.} Nf6 {He attacks the pawn on e4.} 5. Nc3 {I protect the pawn.} Bb4 {He goes for the Pin Variation.} 6. Bd3 {6. e5! is better.} Qc7 {The black queen often comes to this square in the Open Sicilian, but here it is suspect as the queen can be put with tempo.} 7. Ndb5 {Which I do.} Qc6 {This move takes away the best square for the Nb8 to go to.} 8. a3 {I attack his bishop.} Bc5 {I think it would have been better for him to take on c3, rather than lose another tempo.} 9. e5 {I attack his knight.} Nd5 {His knight comes to the centre.} 10. Nxd5 {I take - he can't take back with his queen as after 10...Qxd5 11. Nc7+} exd5 {So he takes with the pawn.} 11. Bf4 {Developing and supporting the pawn.} a6 {Another mistake, he should have castled while he had the chance.} 12. Nd6+ {I check.} Bxd6 {He takes back.} 13. exd6 {I take. I am now threatening to mate him, starting with 14. Qe2+ } O-O {So he castles.} 14. Qh5 {I threaten mate. Fritz prefers simply 14. 0-0} Re8+ {He throws in a check.} 15. Kd2 {I find an unusual way to connect my rooks, I may need both of them!} g6 {He defends against the mate.} 16. Qh6 {With threats.} Qa4 {Fritz prefers Qb6, but the position is getting very hard for black} 17. Rae1 {I may need my rook on h1, as I may attack with h2-h4-h5} Qa5+ {He throws in a check.} 18. b4 {I block} Qd8 {And his queen comes running home.} 19. Be5 {Fritz prefers 19. Bg5} Rxe5 {This exchange is forced.} 20. Rxe5 {I take back.} Nc6 {Black should have defended with 20....Qf8 and although black is losing he can play on. } 21. Rh5 {Now he gets swept away. Of course, if gxh5 22.	Bxh7+	Kh8 23.	Bg6+	Kg8 24.	Qh7+	Kf8 25.	Qxf7#	} f5 {21......Qf6 puts up better resistance, but black is getting mated in 6 moves in that line.} 22. Qxh7+ {I check.} Kf8 {Forced!} 23. Qxg6 {Now it is hopeless.} Ne7 {Delays mate by one move.} 24. Rh8+ {I check.} Ng8 {He blocks.} 25. Rxg8# {And I mate. At this point, unable to stop 30. Rb1-b3# black resigns. Many thanks for reading this annotation. Please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system, to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!}
