1. e4 e5 2. d4 {He always starts with this, and I think that unless you plan to play some gambit it's not very good.} exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {Nothing new yet.} 4. Qd1 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bb4 {Pinning his knight so I can play d5.} 6. Bb5 d5 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 {His pawn structure is smashed, with his entire queen pawn structure isolated and part of it doubled.} Be6 9. Bg5 {At this stage I believe black has the edge. White's pawn structure is awful, black's is good. Black has a lead in development and central control.} O-O 10. exd5 Bxd5 {Now black's bishop is extremely powerful, surveying territory in all directions. } 11. Nf3 h6 {Chasing his bishop} 12. Bd2 Bxf3 {? Not sure why I did this, but it's not good.} 13. Qxf3 Qd6 14. O-O Rab8 15. Bf4 {Black's edge has shrunk but I still this is has a slight advantage due to white's pawn structure.} Qd7 16. a4 {?! Doesn't really accomplish anything.} Nd5 17. Rfd1 {I would have moved the other rook because that rook should be on the e file.} Qe6 {Unpin} 18. Rde1 Qf6 19. Bxc7 {?? I suppose he didn't notice my knight.} Qxf3 {First I trade and smash his kingside pawn structure too.} 20. gxf3 {Look at his pawns: Even if I wasn't about to take his bishop, he'd be in BIG trouble, he has FOUR different pawn islands, they're all isolated and some of them are doubled.} Nxc7 {Black has a practically won game now.} 21. Bd3 Nd5 22. Ra3 Rbe8 {Trying to trade} 23. Be4 {?? Loses the bishop} f6 {?? Misses it, I should have moved one step farther.} 24. Rd1 {Steps out of the pin} Nf4 25. Re1 {?? Falls back into it.} Rf7 {?? Misses it again} 26. Kh1 {??} Rfe7 {??} 27. a5 {??} f5 {FINALLY!} 28. Ra4 g6 {No need to take hit yet. Bd5+ falls to Nxd5} 29. Rd1 Kg7 {If he moves his bishop then Re1+ Rxe1 Rxe1#} 30. h3 Ne5 {?? This is awfully stupid, it allows him to get out of it.} 31. c4 {?? And he misses it.} fxe4 {Finally} 32. fxe4 Nxh3 33. Kg2 Ng5 34. Kg3 Nxe4+ {I take his pawn with check. My knights are working very well together.} 35. Kg2 Rf8 {Threatens Rxf2+} 36. Rf1 Ref7 {Renews the threat, there's no way to avoid it.} 37. c5 Rf7xf2+ 38. Rxf2 Rxf2+ 39. Kg1 {?? Now it's mate in two.} Nf3+ 40. Kh1 Ng3# {Please comment and rate.}
