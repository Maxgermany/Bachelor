[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 {So this was another in my series of matches with the lovely penelope80} c5 {I wheel out my trusted Sicilian - very appropriate while playing an Italian beauty!} 2. Nf3 {For the time being she follows the main line.} Nc6 {As do I.} 3. Bb5 {Played before, but less common than 3. d4.} e6 {I prepare to support my knight with Ng-e7.} 4. O-O {She continues to develop.} Nge7 {I continue with my plan.} 5. Re1 {Another logical development move.} a6 {I hit the bishop.} 6. Bf1 {She retreats it to f1, all part of her plan.} g6 {As the f8-a3 diagonal is blocked, it seems to make sense to develop my bishop to g7.} 7. c3 {She plans d2-d4 with a big centre. } d5 {I decide to try to interrupt her plan.} 8. exd5 {She takes.} Nxd5 {I take back.} 9. d4 {She grabs the centre.} cxd4 {I take, before she can burst through the centre with c3-c4 followed by d4-d5.} 10. Nxd4 {She takes back.} Bd7 {I stop her from weakening my pawns with Nd4xNc6. We are following Lehner, Oliver (2420) vs. Teske, Henrik (2475).} 11. c4 {She gains space in the centre.} Nde7 {So I return to e7} 12. Nc3 {A normal developing move.} Bg7 {And the same from me.} 13. Be3 {Bishop comes out with a plan.} O-O {I finally castle.} 14. Nb3 {She is trying to make something of my slightly weak dark squares in the queen-side.} Nf5 {Hitting the bishop.} 15. Bc5 {Counter-attacking my rook. I break from Lehner, Oliver (2420) vs. Teske, Henrik (2475) where Bxc3 was played. I thought it seemed a bad idea to give up the wonderful bishop on g7.} Re8 {The only square for it.} 16. Qc2 {Preparing to develop her Ra1.} b6 {Attacking the Bc5, and trying to cover up some of those horrible dark-squared holes on the queen side.} 17. Rad1 {Played after a long think. Of course she saw the attack on her bishop, but she worngly thought that she had enough compensation. } bxc5 {So I just take.} 18. Nxc5 {She takes back, threatening my bishop on d7. I could just protect with Ra2 and white has very little in return for being a piece down, but I saw something even better.} Nfd4 {This move just blocks any threats on the d file.} 19. Qe4 {This doesn't achieve much as Nd4 is twice protected.} e5 {4 times protected now!} 20. Nd5 {But she takes advantage of a slight weakness on d5.} Bf5 {Her queen is attacked and very short of squares. e3 seems to be the only safe square, and then I win the exchange with Nc7. She avoids this, but only by losing a whole knight for nothing!} 21. Nf6+ {Like this.} Qxf6 {So I just take, and step out of any nonsense on the d file.} 22. Qd5 {Her queen comes in.} Rad8 {But now where is her queen to go?} 23. Ne4 {She counter-attacks my queen.} Qh4 {Played so that if her queen moves I can take on e4.} 24. Nd6 {This is her only move to avoid more material lose.} Be6 {and now Qc5 is met with Bf8. Again she find the only move to avoid losing more material.} 25. Qe4 {Which is this. However I can now exchange into an easily won position.} Qxe4 {Simply by taking queens.} 26. Nxe4 {She has to take back this way to avoid losing her knight.} Nc2 {With yet another threat.} 27. Rxd8 {So she has to take the rooks off.} Rxd8 {I take back.} 28. Rc1 {She hits my knight.} Nc6d4 {Knight comes in to support it.} 29. Bd3 {She attacks it again.} Nb4 {Attacking bishop and pawn. She can't save both with Bb1 as then I have Ne2+ winning her rook.} 30. Nc3 {I gross blunder in a lost position.} Nxd3 {White resigns.  Many thanks for reading my annotation.
