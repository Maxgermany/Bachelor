1. e4 {This was played at a time control of 5 minutes and a 10 second increment. I thought this was a good example of a superior minor piece, particularly in the end. } c5 2. f4 d5 {Counterattacking in the center. Because of this move 2. Nc3 is more common. } 3. e5 {Gaining space. } Bf5 {Moving the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e6. } 4. d3 {Trying to blunt the bishop's diagonal. I think d4 is better because only one of white's bishops is bad while now both bishop's diagonals are blocked. } e6 {Preparing to develop the queen bishop. } 5. Nf3 Nc6 {Natural development. } 6. c3 Qb6 {Increasing pressure on d4 and making it harder for white to develop his queenside bishop. Maybe d4 was better making it difficult for white to develop his pieces. } 7. Be2 Be7 8. Nbd2 O-O-O {Maybe 0-0 later would have been safer but white can't really get anything going on the queenside. } 9. Qb3 Qxb3 10. Nxb3 h5 {Creating an outpost on f5. } 11. Be3 b6 {Supporting the pawn. } 12. a4 Nh6 {Eyeing g4 and f5. } 13. a5 Kb7 14. axb6 axb6 {White has opened up the a-file, however he has no penetration points. } 15. h3 {Preventing Ng4 and perhaps preparing for a future g4. } h4 {Although this creates an outpost on g3 after Bf2 I would have to retreat my knight to a pathetic square. I think Bg6 and then h4 would be better. } 16. d4 {Failing to take advantage of my weakness. } c4 17. Nbd2 Bh7 {? The idea is good but Bg6 not restricting the rook would be superior. } 18. b3 cxb3 {I didn't want the bfile to open. } 19. Nxb3 Nf5 {Supporting h4, attacking e3 and threatening to jump onto g3. } 20. Bf2 {Finally pressuring my pawn. } Rda8 {Now that I have an advantage on the kingside I try to take control of the queenside too. } 21. O-O Ba3 {Preparing for Bb2, Nxh4 Nxh4 Bxh4 doesn't win a pawn because of a discovered attack after Bc2. } 22. Rfb1 {Preventing Bb2.  } Bg6 {Guarding h4. } 23. Bd3 Nfe7 {Trading the bishops. } 24. Bxg6 Nxg6 {Pressuring f4. } 25. Be3 Be7 {I didn't like the idea of  Ng5 and this further protects the h pawn. } 26. Kf2 Rxa1 27. Rxa1 Ra8 {Contesting the a file. } 28. Rxa8 Kxa8 {After these trades the remaining pieces become very important. Because of his bad bishop I have the advantage. } 29. Nfd2 {Preparing c4. } Na5 30. Nxa5 bxa5 {Creating a passed pawn. } 31. c4 a4 32. c5 Kb7 {Coming to block his pawn. } 33. Kf3 Kc6 34. Nb1 {Preventing a3. } Bd8 {Bringing my bishop into the game by Ba5. } 35. Bd2 {Stopping my plan however increase the power of my knight. } Ne7 36. Kg4 Nf5 {Attacking d4. } 37. Bc3 f6 {I have to find a way to create another weakness. } 38. Kf3 fxe5 39. fxe5 Bg5 {Finally activating my bishop. } 40. Ke2 Bf4 {? Bc1 was much stronger. } 41. Kf3 Be3 {Winning the d4 pawn.  } 42. g3 hxg3 43. Bb2 Bxd4 {Undermining white's center. } 44. Bxd4 Nxd4+ 45. Kxg3 Kxc5 46. Kf4 Kb4 47. Ke3 Nc6 {Pressuring e5. } 48. Kf4 Kb3 {Preparing to advance my apawn. } 49. h4 Kb2 50. Na3 Kxa3 51. h5 Kb2 {The a-pawn will queen so white resigns. }
