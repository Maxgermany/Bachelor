1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. d4 Bf5 7. O-O e6 {Standard opening... for me. White didn't play the most aggressive and good moves, as always. } 8. Nh4 {Foreseen. I don't want to keep the lsb.} Bg6 9. Nxg6 hxg6 10. g3 {So I have a good column. Of course, white is better here. Bf4 is unavoidable. } Nf6 11. Bf4 Bd6 {Best for white BxB, QxB, and the game has an edge for white. I can only try to defend. But...} 12. Bg5 Nbd7 13. Bf3 O-O-O {So far it seems, Bxg3 is a target white must care.} 14. Ne2 {With the c4-c5 plan, a good one. } Rh7 15. a3 {A loss of tempo here, that proves very costly.} Rdh8 16. h4 Nh5 {Building the cannons. I know they wont' work, but... what else?} 17. c4 {Finally!} Nxg3 18. Nxg3 Bxg3 19. fxg3 Qxg3+ 20. Bg2 {White is shielded, I'm lost. But look.} f6 {Rxf2 cannot be allowed.} 21. Rf3 Qc7 22. Bf4 e5 {Not Qb6, since even if I can Qxb2, it is too risky to play it. } 23. dxe5 fxe5 24. Bg3 {Pinned pawn. A big problem. } Qb6+ 25. Bf2 Qa6 26. Qc2 g5 {Attack, always attack. hxg is playable for white, my rooks are useless with the white's lsb. } 27. hxg5 Rh7h5 {The plan is R on the g column, to pin the bishop.} 28. g6 {If Be3, Rh4, targeting c4. But white is still clearly better. } Nf6 {I may as well stop the rook and add noisie pieces into the kingside. e4 is in the air, as Ng4.} 29. b4 {Trapped queen! Oh, my, I'm going to lose this. } b6 {Horrible. Maybe b5 is better, but I'm lost. } 30. b5 Qb7 31. bxc6 Qxc6 {Rc3, or Rb3, or Rf5... they all win.} 32. c5 {This looks as aggressive, in fact. Fortunately, the pawn is pinned to the queen. and it allows...} e4 {Whew! Some breath.  } 33. Rb3 {why not Rc3?} Rg5 {I don't have time to move the king, and being passive. } 34. Rc3 {A tempo is a tempo. My chance. } Rxg2+ 35. Kxg2 e3+ 36. Kg3 {Kf1 is plyable. I cannot go for the rook an a1, since I will be mated. And I cannot recover the bishop, since my queen and king are where they are. } Nh5+ {A blunder, since Ne4+ loosens the pressure by winning the exchange. But I was looking for something even more risky. } 37. Kh2 {Kg4, Qg2+. } Nf4+ {I have to check every move, even if I get out of the pin, c5xb6 is definitive.} 38. Kg3 {I could have tried a perpetual, but I was not sure. The king can shield, and I had no time to be sure. So...} Qg2+ {Or Rh3+, with more or less the same continuation.} 39. Kxf4 Rf8+ 40. Ke5 {Again, Rxf2 was not enough.} Qg5+ 41. Kd4 Rd8+ {If i could get the king in c4, I really had some chances. } 42. Ke4 {Qxg6+ seems good, but I had to keep the pawn. } Re8+ 43. Kd4 Qf4+ {Kd5 is probably a king's walk into mate, but I'm not sure. But the alternative sure is. } 44. Kd3 Rd8+ 45. Ke2 Qxf2# {Inredible. I sac a rook and a knight and didn't recover them when I had the chance, and I won. My apologize to white, he deserved to win. }
