1. e4 {I was White in this game played at a Gambito, which is a weekly tournament at San Diego Chess Club} c5 {The Sicilian Defense is the most common response to e4, but I think Nf6 is strongest} 2. c3 {If you want to play the customary Nf3 followed by d4, then it requires loads of studying because of Black's MANY possible defenses. Playing a c3-d4 boost is a simple way to avoid studying Sicilian lines} d5 {This is the easiest line to play against c3. More complicated is Nf6.} 3. exd5 {Pretty much forced, since e5 is overextensive and leaves Black with a good pawn structure.} Qxd5 {A sharper move is Nf6, because if White wins a pawn with c4, then e6 dxe6 Bxe6 is fine for Black even though he's down a pawn, White has a major weakness on d4, a weak d-pawn, and is behind in development. This variation usually yields White a small advantage.} 4. d4 {The point of c3} Nf6 {A logical developing move.} 5. Nf3 {Another logical developing move} cxd4 {Black avoids me playing dxc5 later, but I wouldn't have since that line is so complicated.} 6. cxd4 {Nxd4 moves the same piece twice in the opening, and Qxd4 lets Black trade queens and go into a theoretically drawn endgame. Although I have an isolated pawn, it isn't weak at the moment, and controls a lot of the centre.} e6 {When your opponent has an isolated pawn, it's good to control the square in front of it, like my opponent is doing.} 7. Bd3 {This is the best place for my bishop, because it aims toward the kingside. I would only play Be2 if Black had played Bg4 earlier.} Nc6 {This DOESN'T threaten to win a pawn.} 8. O-O {My queen is really defending the pawn also, because I can reveal it with Bb5  if Black tries to win a pawn.} Be7 9. Nc3 {Tempo} Qd8 {Qd6 is a much deeper and more strategic move, while my opponent's choice was just simple.} 10. Bg5 {If Black moves his knight, I can trade my bad bishop for Black's good bishop.} O-O {This castles into my future attack} 11. Rc1 {This was sort of a weak move. I wanted to play Bb1 Qd3 to threaten mating tactics, and didn't want my rook stuck on a1, but that would've been fine since my rook isn't needed at the moment.} Qb6 {Black is starting to gain activity, and I got worried here. I thought I was totally lost, because Black was threatening b2, plus he would play Rd8 and may win my isolani. I thought for awhile here and decided my best chance was to just give up the pawn right now for some compensation.} 12. Qe2 {Enticing Black to take the pawn} Nxd4 {Black accepts the sacrifice} 13. Nxd4 Qxd4 14. Nb5 {For compensation for the pawn, I have a bigger lead in development, and a lot more control.} Qa4 {Here Black seems fine, despite being behind in development. I thought I was losing here, because I couldn't find a way to capitalize on my development lead, until I found..........} 15. Bxh7+ {It was this move that saved me. Now I have a lot of activity once Black accepts the sacrifice. If Black declines with Kh8, then I'm not down material anymore, but my lead in development is still present.} Kxh7 16. Rc4 {My queen is really defending the knight because Qxb5 Rh4  wins the queen} Qxa2 {Black greedily snatches another pawn. Perhaps Black could've had a better chance if he'd placed his queen on a5, where it can head to defense, rather than on a2 where it is isolated from Black pieces and has no threats} 17. Qd3+ {Rh4  immediately probably wouldn't have made a difference in the position, just the move order.} g6 {If Kg8 then Rh4 and Black would play g6 anyway to avoid Bxf6 removing the only defender of h7} 18. Rh4+ Kg7 {Black wants me to play Bh6  because even if I win his rook, he'll have two minor pieces plus a pawn, which is better than a rook.} 19. Qc3 {My focal point is f6. If I can remove one of Black's only developed pieces, his king's position will be much weaker} Rd8 {Black realizes the danger his king is in, so prepares to flee. If Qd5 appearing to fork my pieces, then Bh6  followed by Nc7 wins two exchanges, and once the smoke clears, I wind up with two rooks against Black's three minor pieces. Two rooks is usually a better attacking force} 20. Rf4 {f6 is dead} Kf8 {fleeing} 21. Bxf6 {Now I'm only down a pawn} Rd7 {This move looked awkward to me, but I guess it's good since it avoids tactics like Bxe7 Kxe7 Qf6  followed by Qxf7} 22. Bxe7+ {I saw that if Rxe7, Qh8 was mate} Kxe7 23. Qf6+ {I doesn't really seem like I'm down a pawn, because Black's extra pawn on the queenside is insignificant} Ke8 {If Kf8, then I can play Nd6 and f7 is history since Rxd6 Qxf7# Now I can't play Nd6, since Rxd6 doesn't get mated} 24. Rc1 {Now every single one of my pieces is active, and Black's jumbled pieces cannot defend properly. I'm still down a pawn, but not for long. Nd6 becomes a threat again, since Rxd6 Qxf7  Kd8 Qf8  Kd7 Rf7#} Qd5 {Black brings his queen back to the action to defend, but it's too late now.} 25. Nc7+ {The first move of my winning attack} Rxc7 {It appears that Black has won a piece, since 26.Rxc7?? would be a blunder due to Qd1# I'm down a piece again, so the next few moves are critical} 26. Qh8+ Ke7 {If Kd7, then Rxf7  Kd6 Rfxc7 and I'm up an exchange, plus Black's c8 bishop will fall, leaving me up a rook} 27. Rxc7+ {This way lost faster for Black, but was less obvious} Bd7 {If Kd6 then Rd4} 28. Qf6+ Ke8 {Obviously, Kf8 gets mated, and Kd6 still loses to Rd4} 29. Rd4 {Black's position is toast. There's nothing he can do now except resign or wait patiently to die} Qa5 {This was a final desperate move to try for a game steal, because if I carelessly take on d7, then Qe8# would've been embarassing} 30. Qh8+ {Fortunately I have an easy mate in 2} Ke7 31. Rcxd7# {Black's underdeveloped position and greedy queen moves didn't seem like disadvantages when I was down a piece, but now I wind up with an extra rook and Black is mated. Development and king safety are the number one factors in wide open crazy positions like this}
