1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nxd5 4. d4 Bg4 {Mistake. The bishop is better placed in f5.} 5. c4 Nf6 6. Be3 e6 7. Bd3 Bb4+ 8. Nc3 O-O 9. a3 Bxc3+ {Going back would mean it was a tempo loss...} 10. bxc3 c6 11. h3 Bh5 12. Bg5 {It starts to be a little uneasy, but everyting's in control. } Nbd7 13. g4 Bg6 14. Ne5 {White is doing well, but black has no weak points, until the opposite is proven. } Qa5 15. Qd2 h6 {A "daring" move by black, and suddenly it is full of tactics. If NxB, hxB, NxR, Ne4... and a mess. In fact, Ne4 was to be played right now. BxN, BxB, and the white rook and the black knight are hanging. But let's see...} 16. Bh4 Ne4 17. Bxe4 Bxe4 18. f3 {White thinks he is so clever, but...} Nxe5 {Threatening a fork on f3. } 19. dxe5 Bxf3 {So I win my pawn, and maybe the game with this. } 20. Rf1 Qxe5+ 21. Kf2 Qh2+ {A little of an exhibition. Now my bishop is safe because of the queen behind. } 22. Ke3 Qxh3 {I estimated this better than QxQ. Now white can avoid the bishop's exchange, but is is dangerous. } 23. Rxf3 Qxh4 24. Qg2 Rad8 25. Rh1 Qg5+ {White has no escape. } 26. Kf2 Rd2+ {}
