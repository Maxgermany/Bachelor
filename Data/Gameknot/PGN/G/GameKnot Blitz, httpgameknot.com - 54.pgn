1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Offering to go into Danish lines that would probably transpose into Goring or Scotch Gambits after 2...ed 3.Nf3 , a white move order favored by a United States Champion GM Frank Marshall.} Nc6 {Black declines to take my d pawn which could now push to d5, with the trap line of 3.d5 Nd4? 4.c3 and Black would lose that knight, even if he makes his best try now of 4...Qh4. White can defend his e pawn and pick off the N later, tho he must use some care in doing so, to not fall into any tactical error himself in the process. } 3. Nf3 d6 4. dxe5 Nxe5 5. Nxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {White has taken away Blacks Castling rights now, which is the only slight advantage he can claim. And it may come to nothing since the position is not a very volatile one and King safety is not a strong factor. Since the pawns are even where facing each others on both wings, that tends to make a drawish ending as well. } 7. Bc4 Be6 8. Bxe6 fxe6 {Now White can claim some advantage from the doubled pawns of Black. The trouble being, the doubling only hurts black from any winning chances since his pawns on the King side now have little chance of making any advantage there from creation of a passed pawn which is highly unlikely. But this does not help WT since defensively the K-side BL pawns are still functional. } 9. Be3 {To keep BL from Bc5 where it would be most active. } h6 10. O-O c6 11. Rd1+ Kc7 12. a3 a5 13. b3 Nf6 14. f3 b6 15. c4 Bc5 {WT can trade Bishops here. But then the prior remarks about the K-side pawns would not apply to those on the Q-side as well. And WT would have a pawn on b3 to defend from BL attacking it with his open file and potentially would end up having to tie his pieces to that task. Which makes no headway toward winning. But overall, this is a very drawish looking game irregardless. } 16. Kf2 Bxe3+ 17. Kxe3 {The king becomes more centralized now for the endgame. } g5 18. h3 Rad8 19. Nc3 Rxd1 20. Rxd1 Rd8 21. g3 Rxd1 22. Nxd1 {Knight endings are inherently drawish in theory, but inherently not drawn in practice, for they seem to bring out the error potential of any player who does not understand their nature fully or who tends to play a bit too quickly. Indeed it is my ending of choice to enter when possible if I am seeking to score against any fast moving players. } Nh5 23. Kf2 {A concession, WT must give up his King centralization which hinders any f4 push. But that is little lost since getting f4 pushed only continues to be a drawish position where BL would be rid of his doubled pawns. } Kd6 24. Ne3 {The WT Knight is looking to post on g4, and BL needs to move his own Knight now to avoid losing his h pawn. } Kc5 25. Ng4 {Black needs to play the logical follow-up of a4 now, having commited his King to action on the Q-side when he moved it there. In fact, BL may be considered to be winning after either response to a4 by WT, those being bxa4 or b4+. But it is a blitz game and a N ending. } Kd6 26. Nxh6 Nf6 27. Nf7+ Kc5 28. Nxg5 b5 {Again to mention that playing 28. a4 is correct, to make a passed pawn and provide King infiltration. } 29. cxb5 cxb5 30. Nxe6+ {This is the problem with BL's choice on move 28. He would have liked to be able to play a4 now, giving him infiltration, but is not given that chance.} Kd6 31. Nd8 Kc7 32. Nf7 Nd7 33. h4 {Pushing the h-pawn because besides being the most distant from the BL King, it is a point of theory in Knight endings that Rook pawns will be the hardest for a Knight to stop from advancing toward promotion. } Kc6 34. h5 Kc5 35. h6 Nf8 36. Nxe5 Kd4 37. Nc6+ Kc5 38. Nxa5 b4 39. axb4+ Kxb4 40. Nc6+ Kxb3 41. Ke3 Kc4 42. Kf4 {The N must be attacked and forced to move since it aides the e4 pawn to keep out the BL King, letting WT's King stroll on into the action now himself. } Kc5 43. Ne5 {Ne7 allowing the N a choice of posting at d5 or f5 is certainly worthy of consideration here. } Kd6 44. g4 {A mistake. Having played Ne5 WT should continue his theme of blockading BL K from the action, by playing Kf5 now. } Ke7 {Ke6 would have given WT some problems to straighten out. And he can but it takes many more moves and a repositioning of his own N. } 45. Kf5 Nh7 46. Kg6 Nf8+ 47. Kf5 Nh7 48. g5 Kf8 49. g6 Kg8 {50.Nd7 ! Nf8 51.Nxf8 Kxf8 52.Kf6 Queens the most rapidly} 50. gxh7+ Kxh7 51. Ng6 Kxh6 52. Kf6 Kh5 {Notice here the blockading action the N provides with help from his K. WT would like to be able to keep the BL monarch at bay until a Queen provides the denouement, if possible. } 53. e5 Kh6 54. e6 {}
