1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. h3 {This is unusual, but I want to bring my bishop to f4, so I have to provide a square for it to retire in case of Nh5. I am aware this is not for good players...} Nc6 4. Bf4 Bd6 {Interesting... } 5. Ne5 {My plan is the same as always. f6 is not possible right now.} Bb4+ {A waste of time, since I would moved c3 anyway. But he cannot know. The purpose of this move can be to relocate the bishop on b6, a much better square, and to push the knight while advancing the center pawn. So it is not really bad. } 6. c3 Ba5 7. Nd2 {I have to be aware of a possible Nxd4, since c3 is pinned. Just in case I want to play Qc2 sooner or later. } Nxe5 8. dxe5 {Even if the scheme is not my favorite, this move keeps the center controlled more than Bxe5 (d6, B moves, etc.)} Nd5 9. Bg3 O-O 10. e4 {A mistake. e3 was better, since it keeps open the white diagonal where I can easily attack. I though I got a great control of the center, even with the doubled pawns. } Ne7 11. Nc4 {This bishop in b6 was dangerous, so I wanted to exchange it right now. } Bb6 {c6, so he gets his queen out if I want to exchange. But then, how to open the center?} 12. Nxb6 axb6 {Ok, I know I have to play a3 sooner or later. But now, I have to make a plan. I don't see a clear plan: to attack the kingside with Qh5 didn't seem enough. } 13. Bh4 {So, why don't pin his horsie? And free my pawns for a future attack?} Qe8 {Well, nothig was really achieved, but to loosen the possibility of a central d advance by black. But now? He can move Ng6, so... what?} 14. Bb5 {Tempting him to go c6 again. Nothing really good...} Ng6 15. Bg3 {So my Bh5 plan was really not so good. My move is f4, but even I was a little scared not to secure my king. And I need the rook on f. } f6 {exf6, Rxf6, Bxc7, threatening xb6. No fear for f2, he needs some more fire to hit it. But I didn't see it. } 16. Qd4 {Trying, as always, to be original. It was a mistake. } f5 {Trying to surprise me again. If f6xe5, Bxe5, NxB, QxN, and finally black can play d6. } 17. O-O {exf5, Rxf5... I didn't want to open the column for him before castling. I expected f4, ok, so what. } f4 18. Bh2 {My bishop is not playing, for now, but this pawn won't be there forever (I thought. In fact it was :-)} Nh4 {Uh oh: A sac in g2 is coming. I have to defend very carefully, if possible. } 19. Kh1 {If black plays now f3, g3 is ok. } Qg6 {As expected.} 20. Rfg1 {While he cannot take advantage of f3, I'm ok... (?)} Ra5 {I thought all the time a4, here. But hey, it was a blitz game, and I wanted to have fun. So I saw: Bxd7, and black cannot go Rd8, since Bxe6+, winning the rook. } 21. Bxd7 Bxd7 {yes, but I didn't see very well to the simple one. } 22. Qxd7 Rxe5 {wonderful. One of my beloved is gone. And now?} 23. Qxc7 {If I ever reach the final, I'll win with my queenside pawns. } Qxe4 {wonderful. Now I think I'm going to lose, really. } 24. Qxb6 {So I can grab pawns over there, as well. Rae1 would have done it. } Nf3 {gxN, QxN+, Rg2, Qxa3 looked really dangerous, so I just defended "zenly".} 25. Rgf1 Nxh2 26. Kxh2 {Wonderful. So the bishop's problem is solved. } Rg5 27. Rfg1 {stay calm, stay calm... f2 is defended with the queen (this was the hidden plus of Qxb6. It also defends b2, by the way)} h5 {Not the right plan. I think Rf6 would have crushed me. } 28. Rae1 {Uh-oh! I lost my temper, and blundered. I was aiming to e6, of course... but I didn't see the tactic. } Rxg2+ 29. Rxg2 Qxe1 {yeah, lost a pawn. Fortunately, this has a postive side, too: the g column and g7. } 30. Qxb7 Rf7 31. Qb8+ Kh7 32. Qb6 {Defending f2, because after f3 the rook have to fly. } h4 {A blunder. But black was nervous: where is the victory, after such a wonderful position?} 33. Rg4 {All of a suddend, black sweats. Oh, I was planning Rg5 anyway, but this made it easier for me. } Kh6 {Not the right move. Better for black Rf6. But after exchanging rooks, who would have stopped MY queen pawnies?} 34. Rxh4+ Kg5 35. Rg4+ Kh6 {Kf6 is not good, but look...} 36. Qc5 {I want to provoke e5, so I have better access to the king (but not so easy)} Rf5 37. Qd4 {Always g7.} e5 {Finally. After the queen's exchange, noboy would have stopped my queen's pawns. } 38. Qb6+ Rf6 39. Qa7 {G7 again. } Rg6 {Ah... he thinks I will exchange rooks, specially because if I move my rook from the column, Qg1 is mate. } 40. Rh4+ Kg5 {But I saw the next one...} 41. Qe7+ {a little beauty. Rf6, Qxg7+.} Kf5 42. Rh5+ {Another little beauty. } Ke4 43. Rxe5+ {And the game is over. } Kf3 44. Rxe1 Rg2+ 45. Kh1 Rxf2 {what else?} 46. Qe4+ Kg3 47. Rg1+ Kxh3 48. Qh7# {I feel sorry for black, since he had such a good game, such a strong attack... and suddenly, he was the crushed one. His queen kept isolated, very near to my king... nobody would tell he'll lose. So be careful with strong attacks: they can revert against you. And I deserved to lose. }
