1. d4 {Moving my pawn out} f5 {Black moves his pawn out... } 2. Nf3 {I move out my knight} e6 {Black protects his other pawn} 3. Nfd2 {Not the best move, actually. Eventually, I ended up trading this knight for one of his. It never did much.} d5 {Black moves out the pawn} 4. e3 {Protecting my other pawn} Ne7 {Black moves the knight into play} 5. Qh5+ {Putting Black in check} g6 {Protecting the king} 6. Qe2 {Moving my queen out of danger} g5 {Not the smartest move. I don't know why Black did this.} 7. Qh5+ {Putting the king in check again} Ng6 {Protecting the king} 8. Qe2 {I don't remember why I did this.} Nh4 {Moving the knight...} 9. Qh5+ {Putting the king in check again} Ng6 {Protecting the king} 10. Bb5+ {Checking the king again} c6 {Protecting the king} 11. Bd3 {Moving my bishop out of danger} f4 {Black moves the pawn; I think he was trying to open up a path for some of his other pieces. Looking back, I should have done Bxg6+, to which Black would have responded hxg6, and then I could have done Qxh8 and gotten a huge advantage.} 12. exf4 {I didn't see the move and went after the pawn instead.} gxf4 {He captures my pawn} 13. Nf3 {Moving my knight farther out into play} b5 {Black moves out the pawn} 14. Ne5 {Wanting to take the knight} Qf6 {Protecting the knight, pawns, and rook all at the same time.} 15. Nxg6 {Taking the knight} hxg6 {Taking the knight} 16. Qg4 {Putting extra pressure on the pawn on f.} Qxd4 {I forgot to protect my pawn.} 17. Bxf4 {Taking the pawn} e5 {Threatening my bishop} 18. Bxg6+ {Taking the pawn and checking the king} Kd8 {Moving out of check} 19. Bg5+ {Putting the king in check again} Kc7 {Only move} 20. Qxd4 {Taking the queen} exd4 {Black responds} 21. Nd2 {Moving my other knight into play} Rg8 {Threatening my bishop} 22. Bf4+ {Putting the king in check} Kb6 {Moving out of check} 23. Bxb8 {Taking the knight} Rxb8 {Rook takes my bishop} 24. Bd3 {Moving the bishop out of danger. Interesting thing to note: this bishop doesn't move for a dozen turns or so after this move!} Rxg2 {Taking my unprotected pawn} 25. Nb3 {Aiming for his unprotected pawn} Bb4+ {Putting me in check} 26. c3 {Threatening the bishop} dxc3 {Taking my pawn} 27. bxc3 {I take his pawn} Bxc3+ {He takes my pawn and checks me again} 28. Ke2 {Moving out of check} Rg4 {Moving the rook into play again.} 29. h4 {Moving my pawn forward to try and promote it. (When I made this move, I remember thinking that the rightmost side of the board is the least congested and it has the rook to protect it, so this pawn might be able to make it all the way across.)} c5 {I think Black was thinking that the next move would be c4 and then he could get either my knight or my bishop.} 30. Rac1 {Threatening the bishop} Rb4 {I can't seem to figure out what the reasoning was behind this move.} 31. Rxc3 {I take the unprotected bishop} Ra4 {Threatening my pawn} 32. Ra1 {Protecting my pawn} Bg4+ {Putting me in check. Black would have been much better off doing Rxh4, because eventually, that pawn does become a queen.} 33. Kd2 {Moving out of check} Rf8 {Threatening my pawn} 34. Rxc5 {I take the pawn} Rxf2+ {Black takes my pawn} 35. Kc3 {Moving out of check} Rfxa2 {Black takes my pawn. Battle of the rooks ensues.} 36. Rxb5+ {Battle of the Rooks will be right back, after these messages! LOL. I take the pawn and check the king} Kc6 {Moving out of check} 37. Rxa2 {I take the rook} Rxa2 {Black responds} 38. Nd4+ {Checking the king } Kd7 {Moving out of check} 39. Rxd5+ {I take the pawn and check the king again} Kc8 {Moving out of check} 40. Rc5+ {Checking the king again} Kb8 {Moving out of check} 41. Nc6+ {Checking the king again and aiming for the pawn} Ka8 {Moving out of check while still protecting the pawn} 42. Bf5 {Trading bishops to open up a path for my pawn again} Bxf5 {Black takes the bishop} 43. Rxf5 {I take the bishop} a5 {Probably intending to promote the pawn} 44. Rxa5+ {I take the pawn, checking the king and deciding to trade my rook for his. Worst comes to worst, he takes my rook and I take his, and then I can concentrate on promoting that pawn.} Rxa5 {Black takes the bait.} 45. Nxa5 {Taking the rook} Kb8 {Moving the king} 46. Nc6+ {Checking the king} Kc8 {Moving out of check} 47. Ne7+ {Checking the king again} Kd7 {Moving out of check} 48.

Kd4 {Moving my king to try and prevent that.} Kf5 {Threatening my knight} 50. Ne5 {Moving my knight out of danger} Kf4 {Trying to get closer to the pawn} 51. Kd5 {I move my king to try and move it close to the pawn so that I can repel the king} Kg3 {Threatening my pawn} 52. Ng6 {Protecting my pawn} Kh3 {Moving the king} 53. h5 {Advancing the pawn} Kg4 {Threatening my pawn again} 54. h6 {Moving the pawn again} Kh5 {Threatening the pawn again} 55. h7 {Black will probably take my knight, but at least I'll be able to promote my pawn.} Kxg6 {Black takes the knight} 56. h8=Q {Promote the pawn} Kg5 {Moving the king} 57. Qg7+ {Putting the king in check} Kh4 {Moving out of check} 58. Ke5 {Bringing my king closer } Kh3 {Moving the king} 59. Kf4 {Moving the king closer} Kh2 {Moving the king} 60. Qg3+ {Putting the king in check} Kh1 {Only move} 61. Qh3+ {Putting the king in check again} Kg1 {Only move} 62. Qf3 {Trying to mate without ending in a draw} Kh2 {Only move} 63. Qg3+ {Checking the king} Kh1 {Only move} 64. Qd3 {Trying to avoid a stalemate and move my king closer} Kg1 {Moving the king} 65. Kf3 {Moving the king closer to provide support to mate.} Kh1 {Moving the king} 66. Qf1+ {Checking the king} Kh2 {Only move.} 67. Qg2# {Mate. I think if somehow I had been able to keep either my knight or my rook along with my queen, it wouldn't have taken so long, but still... If I were Black and only had the king left, I would have just resigned. I suppose Black was hoping I'd make a mistake and it would be a draw instead.}
