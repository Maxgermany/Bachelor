1. Nf3 d6 {....i tend to use this opening against all flank openings. Depending on Whites next few moves, you can set up a strong kingside attack.} 2. d3 {...normal here would be c4 or d4, maybe even g3 and transpose to an English} Bg4 {...this is an annoying move for white and he has to deal with it, otherwise black automatically takes on f3 to upset the pawns and give some early targets..} 3. Nbd2 e5 4. e4 Be7 {continuing to develop...with e4, f5 will come in and look to castle 0-0-0 after Nc6 and continue with a kingside attack} 5. g3 Nc6 6. c3 {...i think white needs to disrupt blacks activity.....maybe c4, Rb1 and then b4...? Black wants Bg2 to put the Queen on the same diagonal as Bg4 ...} Qd7 7. h3 Bh5 8. Bg2 O-O-O {...have to watch h4 and Bh3...I am prepared to sac material on the kingside here are white is not developing quick enough and the English is a solid but slow positional build....} 9. h4 Kb8 {..out of danger...} 10. Bh3 Bg4 {...want the swap but not this time...but it prepares f5 if it is not taken....} 11. Bg2 f5 12. exf5 Qxf5 {...white needs to release the pin and create grief on the queen side....i thought a4/5 and b4 followed by Qb3 creates and major headache for black owing to the very strong long white bishop....given time..} 13. O-O {....white has a static queen side and black has 5 pieces that can come quickly to the kingside quickly....decided to tak advantage of the pin next...Qxd3 is on, and overlooked it for (what i thought) was a more aggressive plot...myself and the buddy are playing these games relatively quickly so no major analysis done...} g5 {..sure why not....? I can overcome Qb3 and prevent the possibility of white winning a piece (Ne1...and black mustbe careful of Bxc6) Blacks idea is simple, crack open the k side...was prepared to sac 2 pawns here....hxg5 and then h6 looking for Rxh6, Nf6 and Rfh8...} 14. Qc2 gxh4 15. Nxh4 Bxh4 16. gxh4 Nf6 {..white king is looking a bit exposed....} 17. Ne4 Nxe4 {...maybe d5 was more solid....and blocks the bishop...} 18. Bxe4 Qe6 19. Bxc6 bxc6 20. Qb3+ {...white gets a chance to take a sting out of the attack....} Ka8 21. Qxe6 Bxe6 {...decided to open up the king more...} 22. f3 Rdf8 23. Kf2 {..an opportunity to win a pawn here....} Bg4 24. Ke2 {..pin here allows the winning of the pawn....} Rxf3 25. Rxf3 Rf8 26. Be3 Rxf3 27. Kd2 Rh3 28. Bg5 Rh2+ {....white resigns in view of either losing a rook or Ke3 and Re2#...}
