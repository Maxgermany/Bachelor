1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 {Classic opening} d6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 {Pointing at f7 pawn} d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxf7 {This will make his King move and come out to the middle of the board} Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {Checking and threatening the knight. Most possible move: King supporting the knight. But then the King will be even more out to the middle of the board} Ke6 {As I thought} 8. Nc3 {Nailing the knight} c6 9. Qe4 Be7 10. f4 {Nailing the e5-pawn} Qd6 11. O-O Nd7 {Move for supporting the e-pawn... If f4xe5 then Kd7xe5 and I would lose all the try I did to pull his King out. But...} 12. g4 Nd7b6 {Big mistake. He didnt see the checkmate, obviously.} 13. Qf5# {Checkmate! The issue was that his King should remain at the middle of the board. Great Fast Game!}
