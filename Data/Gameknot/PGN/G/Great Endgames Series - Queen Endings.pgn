1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 7. Bxc4 a6 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O c5 10. Qe2 b5 11. Bb3 Bb7 12. Rad1 Qc7 13. Bc2 Rfd8 14. Bf4 Qb6 15. Ne5 Rac8 16. Bg5 Nf8 17. Be4 Bxe4 18. Nxe4 cxd4 19. exd4 Ng6 20. Qf3 Nxe5 21. dxe5 Nxe4 22. Bxe7 Nd2 23. Qe2 Nxf1 24. Bxd8 Rxd8 25. Kxf1 h6 26. Qc2 Rxd1+ 27. Qxd1 Qc5 {Maroczy was famous as an outstanding specialist in queen endings, and here he gives a perfect demonstration of how to exploit what appears, on the face of it, to be a very small positional advantage. His only real plus here is the weakness on e5, and the greater queen mobility that results therefrom, but it proves enough to win. } 28. Qd8+ Kh7 29. Qd3+ g6 30. Qc3 Qd5 31. a3 Qd1+ 32. Qe1 Qd3+ 33. Kg1 {33. Qe2? loses a pawn at once after 33 ...Qb1+. } Qc2 {Taking up a dominant position with the queen. } 34. Qa1 {It must have been hard for White to swallow the need for such a grievously passive move. The alternative 34 b4 involves a pawn sacrifice after 34 ...Qb2, because the weakness of White's back rank prevents the defence 35. Qe3. Panchenko suggests that White should sacrifice the pawn anyway, and continue 35. h4 in an attempt to create some counterplay, by loosening up the enemy king position. However, this seems inadequate after 35 ...Qxa3 (Panchenko only analyses 35 ...h5 36. Qe3) 36. h5 Qd3! 37. hxg6+ Kxg6 (Dvoretsky), and although the black king has been exposed a little, White remains too passively placed to exploit this. } a5 {As so often in endgames, the key idea for Black is to establish a zugzwang. This will be achieved by fixing the white queenside pawns by means of ... a5-a4. } 35. g3 a4 36. f4 {Both defending the e5-pawn, and also to have the chance of a subsequent f4-f5, seeking to open up the black king for possible counterplay. } Kg8 {White is in zugzwang, as his queen cannot move without dropping the b2-pawn. } 37. h3 {37. Kh1 Qf2 sets up the threat of ... h5-h4, undermining the white kingside structure. } h5 38. h4 Kg7 {Now it is a 'real zugzwang', as White has run out of pawn moves. } 39. Kh1 {Or 39 'ii'a2 'ili'dl+ and the white queen is totally immobilized. There would be nothing to stop Black marching his king all the way into the heart of the white position, e.g. f8-e7-d7-c6-c5-d4-e3! } Qf2 {Now White must lose material. } 40. Qg1 Qxb2 41. Qc5 b4 {Such tactics occur frequently in queen endings. The black passed pawn will be decisive. } 42. f5 {A desperate attempt to create counterplay and chances of perpetual check. The other attempt to do so is 42. Qe7 when Dvoretsky's 42 ...b3! (more accurate than the analogous line 42 ...bxa3 43. Qf6+ Kg8 44. Qd8+ Kh7 45. Qe7 Qb1+ 46. Kh2 Qf5 when White can still resist after 47. Qxa3) 43. Qf6+ Kg8 44. Qd8+ Kh7 45. Qe7 Qb1+ 46. Kh2 Qf5 47. Qb7 Kg7 wins comfortably. } exf5 43. e6 bxa3 44. exf7 {44. e7 a2 and Black will promote with mate } Kxf7 45. Qc7+ Ke6 {White has managed to flush the enemy king out of his hiding place, but Black escapes the checks, he runs his king into the region of its opposite number, whereupon the threat of a cross-check eventually causes White to run out of checks. } 46. Qc6+ Ke5 47. Qxa4 {47. Qc5+ Ke4 48. Qc4+ Kf3 49. Qd3+ Kf2 also sees the checks run out. } a2 48. Qe8+ Kd5 49. Qd7+ Ke4 50. Qc6+ Ke3 51. Qc5+ Qd4 52. Qa3+ Qd3 {White loses the king and pawn ending after 53. Qxa2 Qf1+ 54. Kh2 Qf2+ 55. Qxf2+ Kxf2 56. Kh3 Kg1.}
