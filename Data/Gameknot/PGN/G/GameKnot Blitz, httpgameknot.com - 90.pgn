1. e4 {Mate showing Tactical Coordination of Pieces with Regional Material Preponderance. Fischer "Best by test" re 1.e4 ( I assume he means "...for Fischer" lol. However, as Joe Satriani says, "But I  L i i i ke  it ! ..." ) Your Comments upon my games are always welcome. Or Questions, if I can answer them. But if I can't, then that's Interesting ... & I'll probably learn something then~!   }8-) BTW 2 days after, I find there are still admissions to be made. Things I didnt see then and not decided on now. But he has some good moves. Probably I do to. I hope someone points them out quick, so i can just say ... yes I missed that one ...and that one. But its okay, I can take it. (Don't tell anyone this, but I've missed things Before! So I know I can live thru it. That is also the wonderful thing about a terrible loss. To paraphrase Neitche and add my own interpretation, "If it does not kill you it only makes you Stronger" ... if it does not also make you a bit crazy in the end, as they've said of Mr N :)) It has also been said, "Let me entertain you", Shirley Temple. } e5 2. d4 {Steinitz, Marshall, and Alekhine have all played 2.d4} exd4 3. Nf3 {Marshall likes 3.Nf3, as do I} Bc5 {Bc5 is not bad. And there are a number of good counter plans for me. Some take d4, some play c3.} 4. Bc4 Ne7 5. O-O O-O {... and some just get developed and see what transpires.} 6. a3 a6 {Initiating one plan, being to put my Bb2 and remove his from K-side defense.} 7. b4 Ba7 8. Bb2 d5 {Don't open the center when behind in development, unless you can then speedily complete it or must make such a move to live. Here ..d6 or Nbc6 are probably both preferrential. Note my center will still be mobile. } 9. exd5 Nxd5 {Another pieces leaves his K-side.} 10. Nxd4 c6 {Considered Qh5 here, but lets complete development, and see if he trades a potential defender, or prefers to lose a tempo in retreat. Neither as it turns out. } 11. Nc3 Qg5 {Threatening Bh3 to provoke g3?! But it does not do so, as I have Qf3 besides which could probably passive sac the Rf1 for his B here anyway, with my development. So I figure he is trying to bring over the one piece to defend that can get there in one move. 12.f4 is interesting here since it opens a line. But freezes my Nd4 also, Much as like in the Marhall Attack of the Lopez (a black position that is, in the ...c6 lines, if BL plays f5 instead of Rook doubling on the e-file). I don't want to create counter play at the moment. Nce2 is a consideration. But his trouble here is that the Q is not the best defender since it is also an independent target as well. } 12. Nf3 Nxc3 13. Nxg5 Nxd1 14. Raxd1 {It looks like I let him out of the bag. But WT is much better here with his strafing B-pair, imo. The K-side defenders are now down to 2, the K and R. There is the immediate threat of 14.Nxf7 or 14.Bxf7 which he cannot take either or gets backrank mated. And there is something of a bind on developing his Q-side pieces at all, I hope to bring more pieces to bear and try to infiltrate to win material. I'm not expecting Mate from here. So he pulls The Best Move out of his hat here ... } Bg4 {Bg4! Now he has a K-side defender, added with tempo, in a way. Tho it does help me double Rooks, so whether he has really gained a tempo depends largely whether my doubling gets done and is useful. If it is, then he has not really gained much. } 15. Rd2 Nd7 {This is his trouble tho, and why I did not play Rd3 since it would have allowed his Bg6 easier. Now having played Nd7 he must stay on the diagonal with his Bg4 a bit longer. I kick it so I can double now. But he surprises me .... pleasantly however. } 16. h3 Nb6 17. Bxf7+ {Now I thought he must play Rxf7. Then I totally overlooked the powerful move Nc4 becomes playable however, during the game! What a terrible thing to find post mortum! Devastating, and I may never play Chess again, Again! Ion is right (tho so graciously said, I should never have taken those Q's off! After all it was only an extra target, and bind are very fickle ... tho my game with jhfit does show a proper prosecution of a K-side bind, from this very opening) or I should at least have played Bb3 Bf5, it seems. He might try h6 even for some breathing space. Tho it adds more WT sq weakness. With the Queens on that would probably be deadly, as well as an h6 pawn target. } Kh8 18. hxg4 h6 19. Rd3 Na4 {19....hxg5 ??? } 20. Ba1 Rad8 {21.Rfd1~! is Much better now, preventing Bd4 and forcing R removal or trade with same position produced , minus my having an inactive Rook at f1. But that's blitz, I'm down to 28 seconds. Now after I err with 21.Rh3 he must play a piece to d4 and then recapture if I play Bxd4 to stave off a mate, awhile. Maybe long enough with my time situation. He's a good player, but misses he must sac to live longer!? Maybe, but I think instead he put the burdon on me to see it, or whether I just "developed" the Rook to h3 unaware of the Sac, such as to protect my Ng5 from capture. And it does not cost him a piece to find out .... The answer is expensive but quick to BL, but was a quite legitimate try imo.  } 21. Rh3 Rd2 22. Rxh6# {"And the rest is silence", Roger Zelazny }
