1. e4 e5 {Both compete for center control.} 2. Nf3 {I was torn between Nf6, Nc6, d6, and d5. d5 seemed good; I would equalize if he took either pawn. Nc6 seemed to defensive -- not my playing style, though I have played it many times. d6 is perhaps the most passive at all, and blocks my Bishop. Nf6, however, seemed like it would be fun (it was a blitz game anyway :P) and aggressive...nice!} Nf6 3. Bc4 {Targeting f7.} d5 {Offense, offense, offense!} 4. exd5 Nxd5 {At the cost of a pawn.} 5. Nxe5 Be6 {But instead of forcing his Knight away, I play Be6, because I did not like the possibility of a fork on the f7 square.} 6. O-O {I think that white should be pushing pawns.} Bd6 {Now I will force out his Knight!} 7. Nf3 {Defending h2.} Nc6 {Last minor piece.} 8. d3 {Too slow.} Qf6 9. Re1 {Pinning the Bishop.} O-O-O {Look at the development: white is castled, has a Knight out, and is up a pawn. Black has all of his minor pieces out, his King is castled, but he is down a pawn. As we all know, especially in blitz games, a superior lead in development often bests a slight material advantage. Now, white will scramble to catch up.} 10. c3 {Develop, white!} Na5 {Going for undisputed center control.} 11. Bg5 {Did not see this! Now I will lose a Rook.} Qg6 {But I pin the g2 pawn in hopes of mating eventually.} 12. Bxd8 Kxd8 13. Bxd5 {Trade when you're up.} Bxd5 14. Nh4 Qh6 {Pinning the Knight.} 15. Qg4 {This is one of the two losing moves.} Re8 {Take it, please!} 16. Rxe8+ {Yes! the final losing move.} Kxe8 17. c4 {?? I guess he didn't see the mate in two.} Qc1+ {And he resigns. Good game and thanks, deezy!}
