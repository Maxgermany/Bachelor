1. e4 d5 2. e5 Bf5 3. d4 e6 4. Bd3 Bg6 5. Bxg6 hxg6 {By accepting the exchange, white gives me a semi open king column. It can be useful. } 6. Nf3 c5 {Freely, since no lsb is in white's army. } 7. Nc3 Qb6 8. O-O Nc6 9. Be3 {Here, the normal Nh6 would have been the best, but I fall into a naive, beginner trick, and I went...} Qxb2 10. Qd2 {Very smartly, white closes my queen! I still can retreat to b6, but I wanted to demostrate it had a purpose, but I failed to it. } b6 {I think I have escape route in a3, so I just didn't worry. } 11. a3 {Wonderful. White has "lost" two tempos in preparatory moves, and I failed to see its potential, and now my queen is lost. } Na5 {Very well, let's try to get the most of the situation. } 12. Rfb1 Nc4 {Here, I lose a piece and not a queen for a rook. } 13. Qd3 {White, again smartly, is not in a hurry, and just waits. } Nxe5 {I have to fight, otherwise the game would have no meaning at all.} 14. Nxe5 c4 {The knight sac was in order to to this. } 15. Qd2 Qxb1+ {At least, I have a very solid pawn's chain very well defended, and harly touchable by white's pawns. } 16. Nxb1 {White better take with this move or Bxa3. I lost my queen in the more favourable circumstances. } Bd6 17. Nc3 {White's penetration is a technique matter, but I want him to demostrate it. } a6 18. Na4 Rb8 19. c3 {? This limits white's own movements. } Nf6 20. Qe2 Rh5 {This kind of theats BxN, followed by Rxe5, pinning the bishop... matbe not much, but I have to do something. } 21. Nc6 Rb7 {It is hard to contain those two knights, but it is also true that it is difficult to take the better advantage of them. Nevertheless, I had Bxh2+. After Jf1 (or I can stale the game unless white goes QxR), after the retreat of the dsb mate is threatened, so white must lose a tempo defending it and not attacking. Still, I considered that the check wasn't the right path. I was wrong. } 22. g3 Kd7 23. Nb4 {Ok, I lose the a pawn here, but again, I have to create countergame somehow, or the game will be meaningless. So I decided to sac material!} Rb8 24. Nxa6 Rbh8 25. h4 Ne4 {Preparing for g5. } 26. Nxb6+ Ke7 {?! ...and not Kc6... because after Rb1, white would become really dangerous.  } 27. Kg2 {Defending g3. } g5 28. Rh1 {Very smart again. } gxh4 {I have no much choice. } 29. Rxh4 Rh5xh4 30. gxh4 Rxh4 31. Kg1 {White just want to be calm. I have no resources, now. } Kf8 {Getting the king away from checks...} 32. Nd7+ Ke8 {But falling into the temptation of theat the knight with my king. } 33. Ne5 Nxc3 {Nice outpost, but two white pawns were still "hanging". } 34. Qb2 {This is very dangerous. } Bxe5 {I sensed that with the knight over there, it would have been mate in a few. } 35. dxe5 Ne4 {This does not any better. } 36. Nc7+ Kd7 37. Qb7 {I calculated that it was not so easy for white to find the mate combination (it was not for me), so I had time for a last thing. } Rg4+ 38. Kf1 Kd8 {I want to play the c pawn to promotion! But I can't allow Nxd5++. } 39. Qb8+ Kd7 40. Ne8 {Note that there is still no mate. But the bishop doesn't have to be playing. } c3 {After Bb6, Black is dead, but I have to go for... fear. } 41. Nd6 {Mate in two. NxN, exN, and mate in two again. So no use. } Nd2+ 42. Bxd2 cxd2 {Now I have mate in one. } 43. Qb7+ Kd8 44. Qc8+ Ke7 45. Qe8# {Well, just for one tempo... not that bad, being a queen under!}
