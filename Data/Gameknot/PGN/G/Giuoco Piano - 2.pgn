[Opening "Giuoco Piano (C53)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {Nc6 is the probably most played move in this position to protect the key e5 pawn.} 3. Bc4 {Many possible variations from here. I hoped for the boring Nf6 so i could use my favourite Fried Liver Attack but it turns out to be...} Bc5 {The Giuoco Piano! Also known as the Italian Game. White logically places his Bishop on an active diagonal and eyes the vulnerable pawn on f7. This opening was very popular in the 1800s but better defensive techniques, and the advent of the more subtle Ruy Lopez, took away some of its luster.} 4. c3 {4.c3 leads to the main line. White takes control of the d4 square and prepares to grab the center with a d2-d4 advance. Black has to take active measures against this; indecisive play will allow White to carry out his plan, with all spatial gains and perks that go along with a successful annexation of the center. Have you noticed the difference between me and armita's rating? it's about 600!!!} Nf6 { Best play is 4...Nf6 striking at White's e-pawn.} 5. Ng5 {But I had a different plan, turns back into the Fried Liver Attack! Ng5!} O-O {I didn't see that to be honest, Black safely castles to avoid any sort of trap.} 6. O-O {So, I castled as well, now i hope to bring my f1 rook into the game.} d5 {Black takes the initiative with an aggressive d5.} 7. exd5 {White takes d5.} Bg4 {I think this is called a zwischenzug. German for an in-between move. White gets his bishop involved with an aggressive Bg4 targeting my queen. :'(} 8. Qc2 {I moved my queen to c2 targeting the vulnerable h7.} Na5 {Black escapes the en prise by moving the Knight to a5, targeting the unprotected Bishop on c4.} 9. Bd3 {Bishop moves to d3, looking to attack h7, that pawn might not live long you know.} h6 {h6!? I thought the best move here would have been g6 avoiding the threat. hmmm....} 10. Nh7 {Targeting that rook on f8. My chess teacher told me to think that your opponent will do the best possible move, so i thought 10 Bh7+ Kh8 then nothing really happens. But 10 Bh7+ Nxh7?? 11 Qxh7#.} Nxh7 11. Bxh7+ {An exchange of Knights. To be honest, i can't believe i'm a pawn up!} Kh8 12. d3 {d3?! I lost the bishop due to the blocked queen, but this was what i wanted as...} Kxh7 13. d4+ {d4! discovered check wins bishop and as i played 12.d3 my c1 dark-squared bishop has suddenly got involved.} Kg8 14. dxc5 {Now the black queen should take on d5.} Qxd5 {and it does.} 15. b4 {Protecting c5 and making that knight on a5  en prise.} Nc4 16. Qb3 {Queen pins the black queen or would lose the c4 knight.} Qd3 17. Na3 Nxa3 18. Bxa3 {Bxa3? Now i have a bad Bishop.} Rfd8 19. h3 Be6 20. Qb2 Qg6 21. Rfd1 Bd5 {Now a checkmate threat.} 22. g3 Qe4 23. Kf1 Qh1+ {Qh1+! Now, i'm in trouble.} 24. Ke2 Bf3+ 25. Ke3 Rxd1 26. Rxd1 Bxd1 27. Qb1 Qe1+ 28. Kd3 Qe2# {The mate was coming, which i struggled to escape from. Any tips for helping me?}
