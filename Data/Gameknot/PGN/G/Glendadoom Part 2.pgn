1. e4 {Hi Everyone!  I hope you all enjoyed that Part 1 Cameo, now it is time for Part 2.  This time my opponent is currently a Class C player who also had the misfortune to get on the wrong side of Glenda.  How did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis version of this game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18378837&fb=1&rnd=0.9658788367717621} e5 2. d4 {2. d4 - this is the Centre Game.  White makes an immediate d4 thrust following e4.  Both bishop's diagonals are now clear.  I decided to capture and the Wicked Witch of the West recaptures.  This centralisation of the enemy queen is a double edged sword.  Can I give her the runaround?  We shall see.} exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 {3. .... Nc6 - try this for starters!} 4. Qd3 Bc5 5. Be3 Bxe3 6. Qxe3 {6. Qxe3 - bishop trade.} d6 7. Bb5 {7. Bb5 - pin.} Bd7 {7. .....  Bd7 - pin-breaker.} 8. Nc3 Nf6 9. h3 O-O 10. O-O-O {10. 0-0-0 - allo, allo, allo, is white planning a kingside pawn storm?  If so, I just hope Henry can survive it!} a6 11. Ba4 b5 {11. ..... b5 - this move drives back white's lsb and prepares a queenside pawn storm.} 12. Bb3 Na5 13. Nd5 Nxb3+ 14. Qxb3 {14. Qxb3 - white's lsb is traded off for my knight and I notice there is an undefended pawn on e4.  I ascertain that it is suitable equine fare and my ravenous kingside steed gobbles it up next turn.} Nxe4 15. Qf3 {15. Qf3 - nacht.} f5 {15. ..... f5 - this pawn anchors my knight onto this square and this will prove decisive in my favour.} 16. g4 {16. g4 - white tries to undermine my knight but, out comes ........} Qg5+ {16. ...... Qg5+ - ...... Cheeeeck!  Out comes Glenda!  Note, she still cannot get out of that defending groove as my knight on e4 is gonna need a little defending.} 17. Ne3 Rae8 18. h4 Qh6 19. g5 {19. g5 - uh, oh, it looks as if that pawn storm is gathering momentum.  However, Glenda finds a pretty good square to land on and she has her beady eye on a2.} Qe6 20. Nd5 c6 {20. ..... c6 - I decided to stab at the knight so that I can force Qxa2.} 21. Nb4 a5 22. Nd3 {22. Nd3 - now Qxa2, winning a second pawn and putting the WK in Old Matey's shadow is unavoidable.} Qxa2 23. c3 {23. c3 - prevents the mate but I scent blood.} Be6 {23. ..... Be6 - Fou Leblanc joins in the fun.  He is heading for b3 where he will put a nasty cramp on the WK and the other white pieces.} 24. Nh3 Bb3 {24. ..... Bb3 - here white waves the white flag.  Before he did this he told me he was thinking of resignation.  I then told him it was up to him but he would have to give up his queen for my knight to prevent immediate checkmate.  He resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material but Gameknot Analysis told me that I did in fact, have a forced mate in 9.  But again, do you think it is wise to underestimate Glenda?  Well, you may have another think coming because her next victim is currently a Class C player and formerly a Class B player with an optimum rating of 1730.  That is up next folks .......}
