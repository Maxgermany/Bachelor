[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), English defence"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening, not an area with which I am very familiar.} b6 {I was still experimenting with this response at this stage.} 2. e3 Bb7 3. f4 e6 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bd3 Be7 6. Nbd2 O-O 7. O-O d6 8. h3 Nbd7 9. g4 {Well, at least he let me set up my position and there are a few holes I might be able to do something with later.} c5 {With the idea of attacking his pawn center before it get too strong.} 10. c3 {It seems he wishes to maintain his central pawns.} a6 {A prelude to a queenside pawn advance.} 11. g5 {Answered by a Kingside pawn advance.} Nd5 12. Qe2 {I was really hoping for Qc2 here.} b5 {Continuing the Queenside advance.} 13. h4 {The action is in the wings. Problem is his pawns are advancing on my king and my pawns are just advancing (well, there is his Bishop).} c4 14. Bc2 Rc8 15. Nh2 {Hmmm, maybe to bring his Knight to g4?} f5 16. e4 Nc7 17. exf5 exf5 18. Ndf3 {Another Knight enters the Kingside arena.} g6 19. Bd2 Re8 {The only line that is open, might as well fight for it.} 20. Be3 Bf8 21. Rf2 Nd5 {To take advantage of the pin while it is still there.} 22. Ne5 {Hmmm, some hidden danger I don't see?} dxe5 {Still threatening the f4 pawn. (Never look a gift horse in the mouth.)} 23. dxe5 Nxe3 24. Qxe3 Bc5 {Finally, a break!!} 25. Qe2 Bxf2+ {The exchange is the exchange - and since he has nothing else in sight I grabbed it.} 26. Kxf2 Nc5 {That c5 square sure has been nice to me.} 27. Rd1 Qb6 28. Rd6 {Oh my!!!  I can't belive my good fortune!!  A free Rook!!} Ne4+ {And White resigned.}
