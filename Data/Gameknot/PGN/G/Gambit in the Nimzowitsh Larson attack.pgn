1. b3 {The Larson opening, not extremely common but at the same time nothing too out there. My opponent is a club mate of mine so I know his style reasonably well, and sometimes he switches to this, one of his old favourites} d5 2. Bb2 Bg4 {!? I quite like the idea behind this move, it seeks to prevent whites usual play which tends to involve e3, f4 ect and this leaves white with an interesting situation where the 'normal' sort of moves aren't going to past muster} 3. f3 {!? And in fact this is likely the best response, f3 with the idea of following up with e4, actually my opponent told me an amusing anecdote about a postal game he played where without looking at the position properly he chucked out e3?? And promptly resigned when the post returned with his opponents move} Bh5 {Bf5!? Was another option but I didn't want to have to waste a move retreating my bishop after 4.e4 dxe4 5.Qe2 c6 6.fxe4 Bb6 where I think white is slightly better} 4. e4 {Natural and obvious anything else would make f3 a meaningless move} dxe4 5. Qe2 c6 {Solid and best, Qb5+ was threatened which would have won the bishop and other replies like a6 allow white to freely capture on e4 with an extra threat on b7 } 6. Nc3 {Qxe4 is a little awkward for white since black responds with ...Bg6 and then the queen is forced to play to c4 where she is misplaced and the pawn on f3 is taking the most natural developing square away from the g1 knight. Instead the text is a developing move that threatens to win back the pawn } exf3 {6...Nf6 was also possible with a similar idea as before trying to show that the pawn on f3 and queen on c4 would be unfavourable for white but I don't think it's really that bad, especially with a pair of knights having been exchanged. So instead I decide to cash in my extra pawn, and I'm left with a caro kann like structure but white has a good lead in development. I can't remember what the name of this gambit is but it seems perfectly playable to me} 7. Nxf3 Nf6 8. O-O-O Nbd7 9. h3 {Looking to expand on the kingside which would come with a gain of time by attacking my bishop} Bxf3 {I choose to avoid losing any tempo retreating my bishop and instead exchange it for a potential attacker of whites} 10. Qxf3 e6 11. g4 Qa5 12. h4 Ba3 {I am a pawn up so exchanges are good for me, as well as that this could potentially turn into an opposite sides castling position in which case it's useful to take away one of the defenders of the white king and lastly this bishop had the potential to be a powerhouse staring directly into the black kingside} 13. g5 Nd5 14. Bh3 O-O {?! Castling right into the midst of whites attack isn't a very wise this to do, it may have been better to have to have castled queen side or maybe even held off on castling at all, which would keep white guessing } 15. Rdg1 Nxc3 {Now that white has moved the rook off of the d file I feel it's alright to initiate the exchange of knights} 16. dxc3 Ne5 17. Qe2 Bxb2+ 18. Kxb2 Qb5 {Whites attack against my king is a lot more advanced than mine is which has not even started so offering an exchange of queens makes sense } 19. c4 {White declines by by attacking my queen with a pawn however as a result there are now possibilities of checks along the now weakens dark squares } Qc5 20. h5 b5 {Finally starting a counter attack against the white king, having said that whites attack has obviously progressed a lot further than mine has, never the less I don't see any immediate danger so I think black should be alright since most endgame, should be favourable} 21. cxb5 cxb5 22. g6 {Initiating contact between the pawns however black is better in the sense that worst case scenario I can always bale out with a draw by perpetual check, and also if whites attack isn't decisive then black will be better in the endgame} Kh8 {I had considered simply drawing here but decided I would first move my king so that there are no pawn captures with check, I figured I would leave it white to show weather or not he can come up with a correct break through} 23. gxf7 {Probably one of a couple of correct moves, I had wondered at this point weather white might have tried h6 which looks dicey} Nc4+ {I had a change of heart no and decided I may as well go for the draw, after all white was the higher rated player and I've succumbed to too many successful breakthroughs before to be completely relaxed with all the fire power directed at my king. Besides this move guarntees at least a draw for black whereas white must find the correct moves that don't lose} 24. bxc4 {Allowing the knight to a3 would have been deadly this is correct} Qb4+ 25. Kc1 {Ka1 looses to ...Qc3+Kb1 bxd } Qa3+ {And now I expected Kb1 where I was simply going to give perpetual check and declare a draw by 3 fold repetition, instead I was surprised by white running his king out into the open} 26. Kd1 {?? In chat I asked what he was thinking that made him play this and he said that Kb1 would lose to 26...bxc however I pointed out that white has a very effective defence in the form of Qe5!! Which admittedly isn't an easy move to find since it involves a backward diagonal defence which is something that is among the hardest to see in chess. For example 26Kb1 bxc?? 27.Qe5!! Rab8+?? (Rxf7 is better but it is already dead lost and that just admits it) 28.Ka1 and black has no mates and must now give up a further rook to avoid being mated himself, after the text black has an easy win as opposed to a draw by perpetual check. In fact I think it is now something mate in 7-8} Rad8+ 27. Ke1 Rxf7 28. Qd3 Rxd3 29. cxd3 Qc3+ 30. Kd1 Rf2 {}
