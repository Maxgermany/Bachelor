1. c4 {This is an interesting game involving a queen trap early in the game. } d5 2. cxd5 Qxd5 {Queen comes out.} 3. Nc3 Qe6 {? This is not a good place for the queen.} 4. d4 c6 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. e3 a5 7. Ne5 {!? This starts the attack. The f7 is a very weak square since the black queen is blocking the e pawn from advancing. } Nbd7 {? Not seeing the danger. The Queen needs to move and get out of the way.} 8. Bc4 Qd6 9. Nxf7 Qb4 {? This move looks strong but the queen is at the wrong place.} 10. Be6 Nb6 {Discover attack on the white bishop. This move also looks strong but is a very bad move.} 11. a3 {! Queen won!} Qxc3+ 12. bxc3 Bxe6 13. Nxh8 {As the dust settles, white is up about a queen. However, white needs to not get too lazy and throw the game away. } Ne4 14. Bb2 Nc4 15. Qe2 Nxb2 {I do not think this is good since black is down.} 16. Qxb2 b5 17. O-O a4 18. Rfd1 Bc4 19. d5 {!? This move is what breaks black's position down.} cxd5 20. Rxd5 {White is quite strong now.} Bxd5 {Very bad. Black quickly loses. He was already lost but sometimes you can stall the game and hope for a mistake from an opponent susceptible to overconfidence. } 21. Qxb5+ Kd8 22. Qxd5+ Nd6 23. Qxa8+ {The end! Hope you liked it. I think I'm going to start putting games up that I get slaughtered in.}
