1. e4 c5 {No french this time I look to win and try and make this my 4th straight win in the series} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf. Last time this was played I won the game as white (See game 1)} 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 {Still OTB} 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 {The pawn storms have started} 11. Bxf6 gxf6 {Not Nxf6 because white gets a better position and Bxf6 falls to Bxb5 axb5 Ndxb5 followed by Nxd6+ and e5 looks good for white} 12. f5 Ne5 13. Qh3 O-O 14. Rg1 Kh8 15. g5 Rg8 {I saw a chance of an exchange sac here I don't know if my opponent did. 16. gxf6 Rxg1 17. fxe7 Qxe718. Nce2 Rg8 19. fxe6 fxe6 20. Nf4Bb7 21. Ndxe6 Bxe4 its not very good but it was an idea} 16. g6 fxg6 17. fxg6 Rg7 {Stops mate on h2. I could have played Nxg6 or Rxg6 Rxg6 Nxg6 but I wanted my knight centralized} 18. Nxe6 Bxe6 19. Qxe6 Rxg6 20. Rxg6 hxg6 21. Qh3+ Kg7 {Interesting position where black is better developed but white's king is more protected} 22. Nd5 Qd7 23. Nxe7 Qxe7 {I believe that he thought his Bishop is better than my knight} 24. b4 a5 25. a3 axb4 26. axb4 Ra1+ 27. Kd2 Rxd1+ 28. Kxd1 {Black simplifies the game} d5 29. exd5 Qxb4 {Still even on material} 30. Qg3 Kf8 {Wasting time} 31. Bg2 Qg4+ 32. Qxg4 Nxg4 33. d6 Kf7 {!? I don't know why I didn't play Ke8} 34. Bc6 Nxh2 35. d7 Ke7 36. Kd2 f5 37. Kd3 f4 38. c4 bxc4+ 39. Kxc4 g5 40. Kd3 g4 41. Ke2 f3+ 42. Kf2 g3+ {black realizes its going to be a draw} 43. Kxg3 Ng4 44. Kxf3 {Capturing the knight allows the pawn to queen} Ne5+ 45. Ke4 Nxd7 {Its a draw. Even though its possible to checkmate it will be a draw unless something stupid happens. Nxc6 also ends in a draw.  This was interesting because it showed how a pawn majority doesn't always mean a victory}
