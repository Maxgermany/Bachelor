1. c4 {I read a little from a book called Devious Chess last night, and its claims that the less trodden paths are more fun tempted me.  This game is at times very unsound, but it was interesting.} e5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 {All standard fare.} Qe7 4. Nc3 Ng4 5. d3 Qc5 6. Be3 {My first misstep.} Qb4 {His greed would be better served by 6...Nxe3 7.fxe3 Qxe3.  White is uncomfortable but OK.} 7. Bd2 Qc5 8. e3 {It is black's moves which prove less trodden over-all, but he seems better served by standard fares.  Black rarely can attack without consideration of material and position unless white commits some misstep, but he continues to press, prod, and poke sniffing at white's defenses.} d6 9. Nge2 Nxf2 10. Kxf2 Bg4 11. Bxb7 {The crucial capture.  White gives up some control along the diagonal, but his white squares are strong.} e4 {interesting.  12.Bxe4 difuses much of Black's attack, but it does so at the expense of the rook capture.} 12. Nxe4 Qf5+ 13. Nf4 {13...g5 is easily countered, but 13...h6 and 14...g5 probably not so much.} Bxd1 {I wish I could claim that this whole process was well thought out, but the game had rather quick time controls.  As it is, it works out.} 14. Raxd1 {And white holds a slender but real advantage.} c6 {Understandable.  Black would like the trade to be (-2)+5+1-3=+1 and nearly a subsequent theoretical equality.  The only problem is white has considerable freedom on when and if to capture the c6 pawn.  Additionally should black survive to material equality, he will have fewer strong attacking pieces.  Black must survive and prove his equality in the endgame.  White also eyes the d6 square and would love the f8 bishop to simply vanish.} 15. Bxa8 d5 16. Nc3 {White cannot mobilize with enough speed to prevent a pawn on d5.  The square is not the best move for the knight; it is the only move.} dxc4 {Best is 16...g5 which keeps the pressure on white.  The play is interesting, but black is beginning to feel rather underdeveloped.  There are several interesting lines for rapid play.  Perhaps 16.Ncxd5 cxd5 17.Bxd5?} 17. dxc4 {The rook is now given more scope.} Bd6 {I still think that g5 is called for.  The pin cannot last.} 18. e4 {The white knight is gone should black desire, which apparently he does not, so white offers harrassment of the black queen.  Black has fewer pieces in play and white likes the situation.} Qc5+ {Stronger, but prone to more immediate harrassment is Qf6 maintaining the pin.} 19. Be3 {The pawn is poison.  It's capture looses a bishop and allows white to centralize rooks.} Qxc4 20. Rxd6 O-O 21. Rhd1 {Black is losing though not lost.  Black has few quality moves to choose from.  His poor knight cannot move because he has committed it to preventing the bishop's escape.  This may seem like White is effectively down 3 more points because the Bishop lacks scope, but Black is down the knight as long as he traps the piece.} Qb4 22. Bxc6 {Pawn for pawn.} Qxb2+ 23. Bd2 Qb6+ {Honestly I expected 23...Nxc6 when 24.Rxc6 Rd8 solves black's mobilization problems if not his equality problems.} 24. Be3 Qc7 25. Ba4 {Loses the piece, but was Nb5 viable?} Qxc3 26. Bb3 {Few moves for black again.} Qb2+ 27. Rd1d2 {Once again discouraging black development.} Qc1 28. Bxa7 Qh1 {29.Ke3 loses the bishop and makes whites fight difficult but not impossible as black must avoid missteps as much as white must.  And the black knight hangs owing to the back rank mate threat.} 29. Bxb8 Qxh2+ 30. Kf3 {That black queen sure has been active.} Qh1+ 31. Ng2 {Deprived of the perpetual check draw.} Rxb8 {And the hook has been swallowed.  White would probably win without it, but it would be a batte.} 32. Rd6d8+ {black resigns.}
