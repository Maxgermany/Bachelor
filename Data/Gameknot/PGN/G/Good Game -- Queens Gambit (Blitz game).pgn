1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. e3 {Mind White's next several moves, as he was deliberately being coy about the eventual post for his d-pawn, to keep Black off-balance about the best placement for his pieces. I've noticed in tournament games (back in the days I was still going to every tournament I could) the stronger players like Experts and lower-rated Masters frequently resorted to this kind of calculated slipperiness, to lure lower-rated sorts into misplaying the opening, thus setting themselves up for a quick knockout or at least a long-term positional disadvantage with a nearly guaranteed victory for the higher-rated player. ...Never happened to me, of course.  ;-)} Nf6 4. Nc3 g6 5. Be2 Bg7 6. O-O O-O 7. h3 {This should signal White's intent to play his pawn to d4, but it's still not obvious since the advance of the King's Rook pawn is a common prophylactic move. In this case the move takes g4 away from Black's Knight.} e6 8. d4 cxd4 9. exd4 d5 {Black thinks to saddle White with a d-file isolani; but White's continuation will give Black an isolated pawn of his own to worry about, if only for a moment.} 10. Ne5 dxc4 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bxc4 Nd5 13. Nxd5 {White improves Black's pawn structure for the benefit of closing off the d-file, making Black's KB a spectator for a while. White's own pieces, meanwhile, are free to seek happy squares.} exd5 14. Be2 Qh4 15. Be3 a5 16. Rc1 Bd7 17. Re1 Rfb8 18. b3 Rbc8 19. Bf1 {Covering the Kingside bases and also preparing to boot Black's Queen back behind her own lines where she belongs.} Bf5 20. g3 Qe4 {-- ? -- A mistake. Black helps White redevelop his KB to its best square and secure an open file for a Rook, all free of charge.} 21. Bg2 Qe6 {Pretty much a "box" move. (That's "Chess Informant-speak" for ÔÅ§ - the symbol used to mean "only move.") 21. ...Qd3 22. Qd3 Bd3 ends up losing one of Black's Q-side pawns by force, depending on the variation. The problem with the text is that even though it saves material, it also cedes a positional advantage to White.} 22. Bh6 Qd7 23. Bxg7 Kxg7 24. g4 Be6 25. Rc5 {Black is in a minor bind.} f5 26. g5 Rce8 27. Qd2 {Feinting at the a-pawn ...} Ref8 {...which Black rightly ignores. Still ...} 28. Qf4 a4 29. h4 axb3 30. axb3 Ra3 31. Re3 Rb8 {Black hasn't quite glimmered on to the fact that White doesn't care about the b-pawn because he's after Black's King.} 32. h5 Rbxb3 33. hxg6 hxg6 34. Rxb3 {Surprisingly better than 34. Qe5+: White will still be able to call check on the diagonal, and now he gets a file to work with too.} Rxb3 35. Qe5+ Kh7 36. Ra5 {-- ! -- White threatens the very scary Ra8-Qh8 mate.} Rb1+ 37. Kh2 Qc8 38. Ra3 {-- !! -- Renewing the threat, this time on the h-file.} Kg8 39. Rh3 Kf8 40. Qf6+ {And Black resigns. White wins the Queen.}
