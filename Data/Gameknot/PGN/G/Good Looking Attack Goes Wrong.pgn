[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 {54th GK Tournament, I play white.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez.} d6 4. d4 {The Steinitz Defense and white's main line reply.} exd4 5. Qxd4 {Black's 4th move 4. ... exd4 is not in my Ruy Lopez book - heck, the Steinitz Defense only gets about 1 page out of the whole book.} Bd7 6. Bxc6 {Seems almost forced.} Bxc6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 {Developing. All seems good so far.} Be7 9. O-O-O {I liked queenside because it puts my rook directly on d1 and the half-open file, and I'm expecting black to go kingside which leaves open the possibility of pawn advances against his castled position.} h6 10. Bf4 Nh5 11. Bd2 {Poor bishop is feeling no love.} Qd7 12. h3 Bf6 13. Qd3 {Now the queen feels no love.} a5 14. g4 Bxc3 15. Qxc3 {If 15. Bxc3, black can find a nice little hole in my position with 15. ... Nf4.} Nf6 16. e5 {16. ... dxe5 seems to open up a whole bunch of trouble for black. White can recapture with check, or with the knight to put pressure on c6 and f7 while attacking black's queen. Also, the possibility of Bxh6 while discovering the rook attack on black's queen is dangerous for black, too. Meanwhile, black's knight and pawn are both under attack.} Ne4 17. Qe3 {To defend the f2 pawn against black's knight, preventing the fork.} O-O 18. exd6 {Black diffused the pressure in the center by castling, but now I get to wreck his pawn structure a little.} cxd6 19. Rhe1 {Black recaptured at d6 with his pawn, which seemed needlessly destructive of his pawn structure when 18. ... Nxd6 would have been cleaner. I guess he likes that advanced knight where it is.} Nxd2 20. Rxd2 {Now the weak pawn on d6 looks ripe for an attack.} Rfe8 21. Qf4 {Continuing the attack. As it turns out, this was premature and it cost me. A good looking attack goes wrong.} Rxe1+ 22. Nxe1 Qe6 23. Nf3 {Black threatened my unprotected knight on e1. It had to be saved.} Qxa2 24. Rxd6 {So much for winning a pawn at d6. This was just an exchange, and now black's weakness has evaporated and I've gained no material for it. If I had played a little more conservatively, shored up my pawns (or maybe just got Kb1 in there early enough), then went after d6, I might have eventually won the d6 pawn.} Qa1+ 25. Kd2 Qxb2 26. Ne5 {And now I'm down by a pawn with nothing to show for it.} Be8 27. g5 {Here's a blunder. Looks like a pawn exchange to open up black's castle. But it's just a pawn commiting pointless suicide.} hxg5 28. Qd4 {I could not recapture the pawn on g5. If 28. Qxg5, black will play 28. ... Qb4  forking my king and rook. As it is, my queen is attacked by the pawn she cannot capture so she must move. Most of her options allow black to fork the rook, so I see no alternative but to trade queens - deadly when I'm down by two pawns.} Qxd4+ 29. Rxd4 a4 30. Kc3 {Black's pawn is racing for promotion and must be stopped. Seems like my king and rook can team up on him if he advances too far.} a3 31. Rd1 Ba4 32. Ra1 {Nothing much for it. Black's next moves are obvious, but the a-pawn must be stopped.} Rc8+ 33. Kb4 Bxc2 34. Rxa3 {I have prevented the promotion, but I'm still down by two pawns. Black has his passed pawn on b7 that I must prevent from promoting, and he has a 3 to 2 pawn advantage on the kingside. Worse, my kingside pawns are isolated and cannot support each other. There is only one way this game can end, so rather than drag it out, I choose to resign.} Be4 {}
