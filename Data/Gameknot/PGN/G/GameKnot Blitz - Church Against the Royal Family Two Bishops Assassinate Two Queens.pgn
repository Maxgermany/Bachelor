Be2 {First prepare my king to castle so I can move the rook into position.} Bb7 10. O-O Nd7 11. Bb5 {I offer my bishop as bait. If a6xB, then R-e1, QxR, QxQ+!

Ke2 {It's either move out from the deadly dance or let black declare draw after three repeated positions.} Bf3+ 32. Kd3 Bf4+ {Drat! Now Black's bishop can get my queen!} 33. Kc3 Bxc1 34.
