1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {This move attempts to exploit the vulnerability at f7.} Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 {Probably too easily dealt with, but if not dealt with well, white will end up with a strong position.} O-O 7. Nc3 h6 8. Bh4 {?} Be6 9. Nd5 Bxd5 10. exd5 Nd4 11. Nxd4 Bxd4 12. c3 Bb6 13. Kh1 Qe7 14. f4 {? Sinply loses the pawn as 14...exf4 15.Rxf4 g5 loses a bishop, and it may take black a few moves, but once the counter-attack gets rolling, it will provide black compesation for the exposed King.} c6 {??  White gets to sidestep the blunder.} 15. fxe5 dxe5 16. dxc6 {White preserves the bishop.} bxc6 17. Qd2 {!  Moves like these are difficult to react to in quick time when the player misses the idea behind it.} Bc7 {?} 18. Rxf6 {Black saw no need to sidestep the pin by playing Qd6, but now he has to surrender the queen.} gxf6 19. Qxh6 {And the point is delivered home.} Bd8 {Good, but insufficient.  Too little, and too late.} 20. Rf1 Qd6 21. Rxf6 {Black now must surrender the queen or face mate.  After 21.Bxf6 Bxf6 22.Qxf6 Qxf6, white is sitting pretty with a plus 6 material advantage using the common scoring system.} Qc5 22. Qg5+ {And I missed an even prettier mate: 22.Rg6# which makes the formerly appealing mate with the Queen in hazard look ugly.} Kh8 23. Rh6# {#}
