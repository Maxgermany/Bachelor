1. e4 {Gollumed Again.  This opponent has a nasty habit of being able to force the draw. Still at one point I'd have happily taken the draw!} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Bc4 {Seen this sequence from me before? Of course.....} Bc5 4. Nc3 c6 5. d3 h6 {Two significant pawn moves blocking my development. Perhaps slightly negative from black, but thats debatable.} 6. Na4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bd6 8. b3 {Bad move. And dumb of me.} b5 9. Bxb5 {I really should know better.} cxb5 10. Nc3 Bb4 11. Nd5 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 Qd6 13. c4 bxc4 14. dxc4 Na6 15. O-O Ne7 16. Rfd1 Nxd5 17. Qxd5 {Optimism says he sees the queen attack and dodges and doesn't look at the rook.} Qxd5 {Realism says nice try but no cigar.} 18. exd5 f6 19. Nh4 O-O 20. Ng6 Kf7 21. Nh4 {And yet another horrendous move. Instead of capitalising on his mistake I saw the knight under attack and retreated. Obviously KxR gives me material equality.} d6 22. h3 {Another poor move, couldn't think of what to do so did that.} g5 23. Nf3 g4 {That is what happens when you push pawns for the sake of not having to think.} 24. Nd2 gxh3 {Now if I take it I see the bishop and rook combo breathing down my neck.} 25. g3 f5 26. Kh2 Rg8 27. a3 {But I still don't learn. And at this point I'm desperately hoping I can hold on for a draw.} Nc5 28. b4 Nd3 29. Rdf1 h5 30. Nb3 e4 31. Nd4 Ne5 32. Rac1 Nf3+ {Thats a mistake I think. Swapping material fine, but my opponent loses a well placed central pawn and accepts the double. Which probably turns the game.} 33. Nxf3 exf3 34. Rc3 Rg4 35. Rfc1 {Protecting c4 as he still can't defend f3 so the c3 rook is wandering over there.} Bb7 36. Rxf3 Kf6 37. Kxh3 {Just clearing up to make sure there aren't any nasty surprises.} Rc8 {For some reason this move didn't register on me.} 38. Re3 {Looking at R-e6} Rgxc4 39. Rxc4 Rxc4 40. Re6+ Kf7 41. Rxd6 {Really hoping to get the chance to play R-d7....} Bc8 42. Rh6 f4+ 43. Kg2 fxg3 44. Rxh5 {Can't rem why I grabbed that one, I should have snaffled the g3.} gxf2 45. Kxf2 Rc2+ 46. Ke1 Kg6 47. Rh8 Kf6 48. Kd1 Rc4 49. Kd2 Ke5 50. Rd8 Bf5 51. d6 Ke6 52. Ra8 Rd4+ 53. Kc3 Rxd6 54. Rxa7 Rc6+ 55. Kb3 Rd6 56. Rc7 Bg4 57. b5 Bd1+ 58. Kb4 Be2 59. a4 Rd4+ {Nearly went to a5, but B-d1 response would be a problem.} 60. Kb3 {So I do that instead. Genius huh.} Bd1+ 61. Kc3 Rxa4 62. b6 Ra8 63. Kb4 Rb8 64. Kc5 Bf3 65. Kb5 Kd6 66. Ka6 Be2+ 67. Ka7 Rd8 68. Rc2 {Attacking the bishop, but thats just a feint. The real purpose is to try and force the rook exchange by an exposed.} Bf3 69. b7 Rd7 70. Rd2+ {Got him. He can't move a piece in the way, that rook is mine.} Bd5 {Dammit. I forgot that bishop. That wasn't supposed to happen.} 71. Rxd5+ {So I got ambitious.} Kxd5 72. Ka8 Rxb7 {And rather than take a chance on me weaselling out my opponents kills it.} 73. Kxb7 {}
