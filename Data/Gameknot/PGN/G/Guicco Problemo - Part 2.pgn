1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 Nxe4 8. O-O Bxc3 9. d5 {9. d5- this is called the Moller Attack - a variation on the Guicco Piano.  The first six moves were as per the Guicco Problemo Part 1 Game.  The deviation here was that white interposed the knight instead of the bishop.} Bf6 10. dxc6 O-O 11. Re1 Nd6 12. cxb7 {12. cxb7 - the standard Moller Attack - I am just thanking the Lord here that I did not get the Herzog.  This is an extremely sharp variation which involves a kingside mating attack on Henry which he may or may not survive.} Bxb7 13. Bd5 Bxd5 14. Qxd5 Re8 15. Rxe8+ Qxe8 16. Bf4 {16. Bf4 - there has been a plethora of exchanges here.  The Wicked Witch of the West is nicely entrenched on d5 creating a bind on my position.  It looks as though I may run out of moves.} Rb8 17. Re1 {17. Re1 - my dsb and my rook were piling up on the b pawn which was pinned to the white rook.  White moves out of the pin by attacking Glenda who must step aside.  She chooses f8 next to her other half Henry, aaah!  This gives white time to save his b pawn with 18. b3.} Qf8 18. b3 h6 {18. ........ h6 - this is the only move here I can think of which does not have an adverse effect on my position.  I am a pawn up but white has a really super position - loads more control.  I really do not know where to go from here.  Luckily my opponent helps me out!} 19. Ne5 Bxe5 20. Bxe5 Re8 21. Bc3 Rxe1+ 22. Bxe1 {22. Bxe1 - over the last few moves another plethora of exchanges has helped relieve my position a little, but the Wicked Witch of the West is still keeping me in thrall.} Qe8 {22. .......... Qe8 - well, what do you know?  Glenda threatens QxB#!} 23. Kf1 Qb8 {23. ............ Qb8 - after white prevented the mate with 23. Kf1 I decided to play Glenda here to prevent the Wicked Witch of the West from plonking herself on b7 causing havoc among my pawns.  Glenda is also threatening to sacrifice her life for that of the Wicked Witch if white doesn't do something.} 24. g3 {24. g3?! - he doesn't so now I exchange queens, ridding myself of a mega, mega bind.} Qb5+ 25. Qxb5 Nxb5 26. a4 Nd4 27. b4 c6 {27. ........... c6! Necessary, very necessary to prevent white from playing b5 and forcing through a passer on the queenside as my king is too far away and my knight is a slow piece.} 28. a5 a6 {28. .......... a6!  The white a pawn must be blockaded.} 29. Bc3 Ne6 30. Ke2 h5 {30. ........ h5 - to prevent g4.} 31. f4 f5 {31. ......... f5 - fixing the white pawns.} 32. Kf3 g6 33. Ke3 d6 {33. ......... d6 - here comes the Joblock!  Very effective tool until Henry can join the fray, which he does over the next few moves.} 34. Kd3 Kf7 35. Ke3 Ke7 36. h4 Nc7 {36. ...... Nc7 - supporting a possible pawn push to d5.} 37. Kd3 Nd5 38. Kd4 Nxc3 39. Kxc3 {39. Kxc3 - I was not expecting white to meekly exchange the minor pieces.  Please note.  If you are down a pawn in a K& P ending, unless your opponent's pawns are compromised (e.g. doubletons and isolanis) you lose, you lose, you lose!  Here is how.........} d5 40. Kd4 {40. Kd4? Playing into the following Zuggie!} Kd6 41. Kc3 c5 {41. ........... c5!! - I think this is the winning move.  If 42. b5??  then I will play axb5 and Henry will be able to catch up with the a pawn in time.  My opponent will be faced with a wall of black passers and I will be spoilt for choice as to which one will have a sex change back into Glenda!} 42. bxc5+ Kxc5 43. Kd3 d4 44. Kc2 Kc4 45. Kd2 d3 {45. .......... d3 - over the last few moves white has had to go back, back back.  Now white makes a mistake and plays 46. Kc1.  Kd1 would have prolonged the game but I would have manoeuvered Henry over to f3 and I would be able to clean up a couple of kingside pawns and crown the h pawn about 3 moves before white could crown his a pawn.  However ......} 46. Kc1 Kc3 47. Kd1 d2 {47. ......... d2 - this brings about a white flag from my opponent as he is now deep in Zuggieland!  He has only 2 legal moves left, g4 which is scuicide as either f or h pawn can simply take it and waltz through to queen, or Ke2 allowing Kc2 and on the next turn, kaboom, Glenda reappears!  I am so relieved at the outcome of this game as I thought I was in a lot of trouble in the middlegame with a cramped position.  I still have a tendency to play passively which I am trying to correct but all the same, my rating is now 1698 which is now the highest it has ever been on gameknot and I only need one more win or high draw to push me over the 1700 frontier!}
