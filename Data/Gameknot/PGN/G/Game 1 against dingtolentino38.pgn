[Opening "KGA (C34), Fischer defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 {King's Gambit, my new favorite. An aggressive opening...It keeps the board open, which is my preference. } exf4 {Accepted.} 3. Nf3 d6 4. Be2 h6 5. d4 a6 {Up until now, it has been book Fischer defense. I don't prefer the Fischer as White, because it stops an eventual Nxf7. It doesn't, however, prevent Bxf7+!} 6. Bxf4 {Scoring back material. Book Fischer doesn't allow this, because of 5. ...g5.} Nf6 7. Nc3 Nc6 {All four Knights come in.} 8. Qd2 {Now I can castle to either side.} Be7 9. O-O-O {I chose Queenside because I thought he would castle Kingside. } d5 10. exd5 {Ripping open the middle.} Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 12. Kb1 {Protecting the a-pawn.} Be6 {Double trouble on the a2-g8 diagonal.} 13. b3 O-O-O 14. Bc4 Qe4 15. Rhe1 {Blunder. This allows Bb4!} Qf5 16. Bxe6+ fxe6 17. g3 Bb4 {As foretold.} 18. Qd3 Qa5 {? Perhaps he wanted to keep the BSB for mating purposes.} 19. Rxe6 {Evacuating the area.} Bc3 20. Bc1 {Stopping mate threat cold in its tracks.} Bb4 21. g4 {Qf5.} Ba3 22. Qf5 Qb4 23. d5 {Getting that pesky Knight out of the way.} Ne7 {Free food? I'm there!} 24. Rxe7+ Kb8 25. Qe5 Qa5 26. Bxa3 Qxa3 {Worst move. Perhaps Rc8 or Qd6.} 27. Qxc7+ {Here Black resigned. Mate is unavoidable. I hope you enjoyed this game! Please R&C and tune in for game two!}
