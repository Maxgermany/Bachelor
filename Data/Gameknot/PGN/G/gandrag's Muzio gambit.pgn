1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O gxf3 6. Qxf3 {Difficult opening, hard to play for white} Bc5+ 7. Kh1 Qf6 8. c3 Nc6 9. d4 Nxd4 {I am not sure about giving back the knight. It seems to me that white has to large an advantage in development.  For me personally, I like games where I have a lead in development.} 10. cxd4 Bxd4 11. Nc3 {Blocking he diagonal to b2, and threateing Nd5 in the process. Maybe black should just exchange some pieces here with Bxc3, to reduce white's development advantage.} c6 {This seems to slow.} 12. Bxf4 h5 {Preventing the threatening Qh5, but black falls even further behind in development.} 13. e5 {This one cannot be taken, black cannot afford to open the e1-e8 line.} Qf5 14. Ne4 {Punishment for not trading the Bisshop for the Knight. Of course Nd6 is threatening.} Qg4 {I exepcted 14...,Bxe5; 15.Nd6+ !, Bxd6; 16.Bxd6, Qxf3, Rxf3;  Blacks King is then caught in a net, even with no Queens on the board. In fact if wite plays correctly, the checkmate is forced.  Instead of 15.ND6+, the more simple Ra1-e1 is also good, but not as strong.} 15. Bg5 {Still attemting to trap blacks King. This was probably black last chance to play d5 and escape the net.} Qxf3 16. Nd6+ {Ha!  Blacks bisshop and rook are trapped beind the wall of his own pawns. White has to act with a little haste, but in a sense he has a rook and a bisshop extra on the board. Blacks King remains in the net, even without the Queens.} Kf8 17. Rxf3 {Preparing an attack over the f-file, by doubling the rooks. } f6 {Probably the only way out.} 18. Re1 {Not bad, but exf6 would have been stronger, blocking e7 for black King.  } b5 19. exf6 {There is no time now for moving the bisshop. After Bb3, Ba6, black get another piece into play.  Now white as the immeadiate threat Re8#;} Ba6 20. f7 {Once again white has to play aggressively.  The only way to prevent White promoting a Queen is Nh6 or Nf6. Both moves lose a lot of material however.  Finally Black realized there is no more escape, and he resigned. }
