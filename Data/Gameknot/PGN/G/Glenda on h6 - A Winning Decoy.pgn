1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is the Kings Indian Defense - 4 pawns attack mini-tournament and the third game in my Glenda on h6 theme and this is the happiest outcome of the lot!  Although I do not get to deliver mate, a trade off between Glenda and the Wicked Witch of the West results in a decisive gain of material in my favour.  Wanna see how, well read on .....} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 {6. Nf3 - again my favoured response after the forced moves.  It adds support to the 4 pawns and develops a piece.} c5 {6. ..... c5 - this pawn move tries to undermine the formidable line up of the 4 white pawns on the fourth rank.  To avoid a serious breach in the wall I play d5.} 7. d5 e6 8. dxe6 Bxe6 {8. ....... Bxe6 - the wall has at last been breached by a pawn trade on e6.  Now I need to develop my back row and I start with Fou Leblanc who moves to d3 to clear the way for kingside castling.} 9. Bd3 Nc6 10. f5 {10. f5 - but first I plan to create a breach in my opponent's castled position and this is the start of it.} Bd7 11. O-O {11. 0-0 - although I do create a balance of king safety and attack on enemy king.} Rb8 12. Bf4 {12. Bf4 - Fou Lenoir develops and suddenly threatens Bxd6 winning the exchange + pawn as the d6 pawn is hanging.  Fatcat2 parries the threat with Ne8 - it does make the knight passive though but can I exploit this.  Hmm, read on......} Ne8 13. Rc1 Ne5 14. Nxe5 Bxe5 15. Bxe5 dxe5 {15. ...... dxe5 - over the last few moves there has been a plethora of exchanges - now black's dark squared bishop is absent, Glenda has a sudden deep desire to leap on her broomstick and get there asap.} 16. Nd5 {16. Nd5 - first though I decided to create an outpost on d5 and threaten to play a move such as f6.  Once Glenda gets onto h6 it could be curtains for the BK if I can only prize that knight out of e8!} Nc7 {16. ...... Nc7 - my opponent kindly offers me a trade off of that defending knight!  I decided to let my opponent trade first because Glenda sneaks onto d2 ready for destination h6.  Notice that after the trade I will take the opportunity to rid myself of my backward pawn on e4 which will open up a line for Fou Leblanc through to h7 to give me more attacking options.} 17. Qd2 Nxd5 18. exd5 Re8 {18. ...... Re8 - as you can see, that rook is gonna make way for the Wicked Witch to land on f8.  Now Glenda lands on her desired square, h6.} 19. Qh6 {19. ...... Qh6 - I did wonder about f6 but then black could play h6 followed by Kh7 and scupper Glenda's plans to land on h6.  So Glenda to h6 it was!} Qe7 20. Rce1 {20. Rce1! - I give this move an exclamation mark because I was feeling sooo frustrated at another mating attempt being foiled.  However, I suddenly analysed that I could win at least a pawn by a decoy by Qxf8+.  Now, take a look at the position after 21. Qxf8+ .....} Qf8 21. Qxf8+ {21. Qxf8+ - Now if Rxf8 you will see that the pawn on e5 is hanging.  Black thinks he can save this pawn however by playing Kxf8, but a trade of pawns on g6 is gonna unsave it!} Kxf8 22. fxg6 hxg6 23. Bxg6 {23. Bxg6 - you wouldn't have thought this move possible a couple of moves before would you?  Look though.  The pawn on f7 is pinned to the BK by my rook on f1.  Therefore Fou Leblanc steals a pawn in broad daylight.  This is the sort of thing that my two buddies, Coach Ion and Untateve (Steve) have been inflicting on me.  Well, it seems that I may have learned something out of those games because it is my opponent and not me on the receiving end this time!} Re7 {23. ..... Re7 - defends the f7 pawn but there is a little pawn stab still to come.....} 24. d6 {24. d6!  - another decoy, this time to lure the black rook away from the defense of the f7 pawn.  If 25. ..... Re6 then 26. Bxf7, attacking the e6 rook and threatening a very nasty discovery on the f column.  If black responds with Rxd6 then 27. Bd5+ any then 28 Rxe5 sees me two clear pawns ahead.  Black did not fancy this and waved the white flag!  I wish I could do this more often!}
