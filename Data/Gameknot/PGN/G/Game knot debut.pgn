1. e4 {According to my database this is one of the first ever games that I played on gameknot. Back then I was revealling in the strength and security of the berlin defence. It is a solid defence and is aptly names the berlin wall for a reason. The Berlin endgames are quiet and boring } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {...deferring a6 since that is exactly that white would appreciate the fact that black has over extended himself on the queenside only assist white in moving his bishop to a square that he was intended to land on anyway! So ... Nf6 is defiant refusal follow white's lead. } 4. O-O Nxe4 {The beginning of the Berlin wall defence black gives up a temporary lapse in development to remove the central pawns. In exchange black gets a nicely placed knight and no pawn weakness. } 5. Re1 Nd6 {...Nd6 invites the complete destruction of the centre but again black gives nothing for white attack!} 6. Nxe5 {I never liked that pawn anyway} Nxe5 7. Rxe5+ Be7 {Ok it is time to hit the pause button here because we have arrived at a critical juncture in the game. That superbly illustrates our goal of learning how to "find the right plan."  Q: Who is better here?  A: To answer this question we need to know what the indicators are of an advantage. There are 5 indicators and they are as follows: 1. advantage in development and control of the centre 2. Possession of supporting points and open lines 3. material superiority 4. advantageous pawn structure  5. presence of weaknesses in the enemy position.   Based upon the above indicators we can use the follow model to make a solid evaluation what white should play next.   1. Material relationship - The material relationship between forces is equal, no advantage to either side. 2. Presence of direct threats - white has no direct threat, while black has the threat of securing the plus of a bishop pair with ...Nxb5. the advantage is to black. Black also has the strategically better ...c6 to harass the bishop which increases control of D5.  3. King position and their safety - white has castled to safety while the black king is still in the centre, advantage white 4. Possession of support squares and open lines - white current controls sole possession of the e-file while black has nothing, advantage to white 5. Pawn structure, weak and strong squares. - both pawn structures are identical, there are no immediate weaknesses, and no strong squares have emerged, no advantage to either side 6. The centre and space - white currently enjoys more space and mobility based on the fact that he has great control and influence in the centre, Black has yet to make a difference in the centre, advantage white. 7. Development and position of pieces.  -White has a slight lead in development because his king is castled. This however has not had a significant impact on the game, White pieces are temporally more active but blacks piece are more harmoniously placed. neither side has an advantage  Conclusion:  Whites plan must include: - must deal with the immediate threat of the bishop capture - consolidate control in centre - complete development  Black's plan must include: - challenge for control in the centre - fight for the e-file -castle king to safety - complete development  Final evaluation: White has a slight advantage.   so as black I was expecting 8. Be2 f6 to fight for control of the e-file and challenge for space in the centre. } 8. Qe1 {?? It was better to move the bishop. Although it looks like e7 is shaky it is not because black has a wonderful resource that allows him to beat up on the white rook. } Nxb5 {! Black exchanges a piece which is preferable in cramped positions. Plus Black deflects White's rook off of the e-file. this results in white losing control of the centre. } 9. Rxb5 c6 {...c6 white begin to think of ways to neutrize the increasing strength of black's queen pawns. } 10. Re5 d6 11. Re2 {Black has achieved most of his planned objectives while white has taken several steps back. Black is clearly better but how should he proceed? Based upon the prior evaluation we know that black has to work on two other negatives.   1. complete development 2. king safety 3. fight for the e-file  *completely development would increase black'  current advantage in centre and space *the king safety is not currently an issue so black can forgo castling in order to take advantage of tempo *black currently does not have the resources to fight for the e-file.   So I played ...Be6 it accomplishes two out of the 3 objectives} Be6 {now it is white who is suffering from congestion and a slight disadvantage in the position. Black has a strong control of the centre, two beautifully placed bishops and a nice pawn structure, White has a poorly placed rook and is behind in development. } 12. d4 {Naturally white has to now fight for some space in the centre or black will gain a winning advantage} O-O {Having completed all of his objectives black is now ready to take energetic action. } 13. Nd2 {?? white is seriously behind in development and to compound the issue he has hindered the development of his DSB. This makes d4 a sitting duck. My plan is to attack d4 but right now I can not because I have to reorganize my pieces to target d4. However, white can at the moment defend against an immedaite ...Bf6 with Nf3 so I forgo the immedaite ...Bf6 for something more subtle and compounding. } Re8 {this has the threat of 1. ...Bf6 2. Nf3...Rxe2 3. Qe8 3. Qxe8 Rxe8 winning the e-file and retaining the attack in d4.} 14. c4 {?? a gift from white with his DSB still at home and with no real way to get out immedaitely the d4  pawn becomes the focus of attention. White is playing with no clue of the underlining threats on the e-file and ...bf6. But thanks to the fact that I had evaluated the position 10 move back my moves up until now have been no brains.  What white should have done was appreciate the pressure that black was putting on D4 by playing Nf3} Bf6 {attacking the weak d pawn and threatening to take it. White must now defend it } 15. Re4 {?? not sure what this move was about but not a great way to defend d4. Best was the calm Nf3.} d5 16. cxd5 {?! 16. Re2 keeps the black bishops under control for the moment. } Bxd5 {Black wins the exchange gets two beautiful bishops, greater control of the e-file, complete domination of the centre and up coming material superiotity. All of this means is that black now has enough for a win. The plan is to simplify with piece exchanges} 17. Rxe8+ {I was expecting Re2 but white can not stop the reduction in pieces as 17. Re2 Rxe2 18. Qxe2 Qe8 is worse for white.  } Qxe8 18. Qe3 {a good move if black plays the expected 18. ...Qxe3 which will help support d4 and 18. Qxe8 just loses the e-file } Qd7 {x-raying d4 and threatens to play ...re8 winnng the e-file. } 19. Nf3 {White finally sees the need to defend d4 but it is too late. } Bxf3 {removing a defender of d4 in order to avoid the loss of another pawn white is forced play gxf3} 20. Qxf3 {white wisely lets go of the pawn as 20. gxf3 Bxd4! wins the pawn anyway. } Qxd4 {white resigns as it is an easy win from here. White is soundly defeated because black found the right plan. Plus this was an easy win for black because I took the time to evaluate the position at move 8 after that I hardly had to think during the game. In total I maybe thought for 10 minutes. }
