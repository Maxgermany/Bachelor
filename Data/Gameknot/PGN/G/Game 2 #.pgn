[Opening "Reti (A09), advance variation"]

1. Nf3 {commetry by, Crazyeye180 (Black) and Davidtornheim (White)  the second in a series of (so far) two very very close games: the first was a queens gambit 1-0 (crazyeye180 white), and the third is currently in progress - a sicillian, Davidtornheim with the white pieces.} d5 {Black :this has always been my response to Nf3, it seems to be solid and catches people who expect knight moves unaware. It also allows black to steer white away from e4 opening traps – which I hate. It also fits in fairly well with my queens pawn opening play as white as some of the ideas seem to be the same.  White: I agree and play the same.  When Reti first played 1.Nf3, his master opponents played either d5 or Nf6, still the most common replies today and approved by Rybka and Fritz.  I too play d5 when black, as 2. c4 d4 followed by 3. ... c5 quickly establishes a troublesome cramping outpost in the midst of White's undeveloped space, which will only get worse if ignored.} 2. c4 {White:  Reti.  If I wanted a Queen's Gambit, I would have played 1. d4.} d4 {White:  Yes, better than the other common moves dxc4, c6 and e6  I think.  Rybka and Fritz also prefers it.} 3. e3 {White:   Reti's reply.  Rybka and Fritz agree this is best.} Nc6 {White:   Either this or c5 are both strong.} 4. exd4 {White:	   Reti's choice.} Nxd4 5. Nxd4 Qxd4 6. Nc3 e5 {Black:   6. …   Nf6 is apparently better, as played by Junge – Alekhine 1942 (0 – 1) – I think the plan is for black to challenge for the centre with this knight aiding the e pawn  etc. in an opposite vien 6. … c6?! (Fridman – Short 1999 (1/2 -1/2)) aims to give white’s centre mobility problems and take some of the sting of white’s white bishop.  White:	Rybka agrees, but most people play e5.} 7. d3 Bc5 8. Be3 {White:  Time to start chasing the Queen around, while developing my pieces.} Qd6 9. Ne4 {Black: perhaps 9. Nb5 would be stronger? – it still hassles the queen and assuming black plays Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Qe7 the knight is now in a more useful position, and protects d4 for the pawn advance.  White:  Rybka agrees that Nb5 is better by 0.3 of a pawn.} Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Qe7 {Black: using the won tempo to cover the weak black squares on the kingside – I almost expected something like Qg5 to come next here however that wouldn’t be much of a game. I think this position is even.  White:  Rybka agrees it's about even with 0.16 advantage to white, although thought 11. Qd4 was a slightly better move for black.} 12. Be2 {Black: 12.  0-0-0 perhaps is stronger? Making the most of white’s developed pieces – giving his centre a bit of a boost? Black hasn’t got a black bishop any more so there’s no threat of the pin on the queen, and white has time before black can activate his other pieces, and due to the black queen’s position …f5? To challenge the knight isn’t strong as it practically damns the knight and limits black’s castleing options. Though this line is interesting and might be worth looking into.  White: Rybka gives:  Be2 (0.10), Rd1 (0.03), O-O-O (0.02).} Nf6 13. Nxf6+ { Black:  I don’t understand this. White’s knight is in a much better position than black’s and it’s moved more – therefore it’s worth more. Whilst this move does kind of force white to win another tempo on the queen white kills his own attack. Perhaps castling would be better. – let black deal with it and keep the initiative.  White: White and Rybka disagree with the above,and find castling on either side slightly inferior.  Rybka rates Nxf6+ at 0.13-0.18 and castling at 0.08 and O-O-O at -0.10 , a slight but significant difference.   White expected (and Rybka strongly advises)  13. … Nxe4 14. dxe4, because black would not tolerate the presence of this centralized knight.  Regardless of how that knight got to such a strong presence, white assumes his opponent will make the strongest move and it will be gone in one move.  Given its doom, white must decide:   is it better to be taken or to do the taking?  If white waits to be taken by black, he is left with two unprotected pawns and the Queen  wide open for attack by a rook on the d-file, that rook protected by the Queen safely at e7.    On the other hand, if white takes black’s knight first, black does not gain any tempo, because his Queen will have to expend a move recapturing.  This recapture move by black does not improve the his Queen’s position.   In fact, with O-O, the black Queen is in danger of the castled rook, which White hoped would be unveiled unexpectedly at a time inconvenient for black.  f4 nicely accomplishes this on the next move, a move that an overconfident White unfortunately overlooked.   So black’s Queen was safer at e7, and the recapture move was of no benefit and if anything lost time.   So, white chose to do the taking to prevent the undesired scattering of his pawns by the recapture preferring black’s recapture putting his queen in a possible line of fire at f6.   White did not seriously consider O-O-O because the King is a bit too vulnerable with the stray c-pawn, which can be easily attacked by Be6, a move Rybka recommends.   However, White concedes that O-O-O does appear to have a strong attack up the center, but with the Queen in the lead, and black’s queen side rook about to come out, it looks more like the attacking Queen would get ambushed rather than the reverse.  Black: Ok, perhaps this is a matter of taste. personally i would rather have the pawns on e and c unprotected and the fully open file with my rook and queen down the centre.} Qxf6 14. O-O O-O 15. b4 {As discussed above White's best move was f4.  White admits to being asleep at the wheel with b4.  Rybka ranked it as the 20th best move.  Given that programmers estimate roughly 20 possible moves for a typical middle game position, this is not a very high ranking.  With 75% of the minor pieces off the board and White's King was safely defended and could start looking towards the end game.  White's plan was to win with better pawn positions by quicker movement on the queen-side:  The idea was to move his a and b pawns two squares forward depriving his opponent the same move and slowing him down. White could also increase the length of the pawn chain.     The drawback was that with the rapid advance of the b-pawn, it could not longer defend the c-pawn, which was later captured undefended.  White failed to take into account the activity soon to come from the undeveloped rooks.     Before this move, Rybka rated white at a 0.10 advantage.  After at -0.23.} Bf5 {As discussed above White's best move was f4.  White admits to being asleep at the wheel with b5.  Rybka ranked it as the 20th best move.

Rad1 {White:  Now that black has attacked the base pawn to his chain, his kneejerk reaction is to add a defender.  He notes that black can pile on more attackers as is carefully analyzing the danger.  White has two goals for this pawn:  either keep it as the base of the pawn chain or advance it to the other side of the board, defended by multiple heavy pieces.  In past games using Reti, White has won games with center pawns making it to the other side aided by rooks, so why not plan ahead?} Rad8 {White:  Black indeed throws another attacker at the base pawn.} 17. Qe3 {A little furniture rearrangement so as to continue to have 3 defenders on the base pawn.  With the old arrangement, the Queen was the second defender, but we want our smaller defenders first.  With the new arrangement, the rook can take second and the queen third.  This also will make room for double rooks in a couple of more turns.  Maybe black won't notice his a pawn is under attack.     White was particularly concerned with a possible e4 pawn advance, adding a 3rd attacker, and then Qg6, a forth attacker.  However, Rybka doesn't see an issue with e4 advance,  as d4 advance works just fine, even with the Queen where it is, but it approves of the Qe3 move, nonetheless.} b6 {White:   Black protects the a-pawn.  Rybka prefers Rd4 at this point; however, Black eventually discovers and plays it at move 20.} 18. Bf3 {White:  With Black's advance, white takes pleasure at long range diagonal shots fired at the queen side.  The bishop makes a tidy move rearrangement similar to that of the queen, capturing the beautiful long diagonal parallel to that of the Queen creating a swath of squares his opponent can't use.  White's main reason originally for considering the move was to support a b5 pawn advance on the next move} c6 {White:  prevents b5 and clips 4-squares off of white's long diagonal, but only if it remains defended by the Queen, or perhaps later the center rook.} 19. Rd2 {White:  Rybka prefers Rfe1 or pawn moves.} Rfe8 {Black: close to even here I think with the main difference that black has command of the half open d file – I thought as this was my main advantage it was to be defended at all costs: hence move 20...  White:   Rybka agrees, rating it at -0.21.} 20. Rfd1 {White:  Rybka still prefers Re1 even now or the pawn moves a3 or h3.   White is about to find out what!} Rd4 {Black: ! my favourite move for black of this game, though I feel I didn’t make the most of it.   White:  Ouch!  White was completely blindsided by this, even joked with black to please move the Rook back!  This outstanding move could have been made back as far as move 17.     White’s pawn advance has been blocked, which makes the two connected rooks useless.    What’s worse, the centralized rook cannot be evicted by any pawn or minor piece, and trading it with another rook would take far too many moves.  The only way to get it to move is to tempt with some morsel, (like say, a stray pawn, or require its use in a recapture, or find a way to get the e-pawn on the d-file by a capture.  (White eventually put its beautifully developed bishop on the chopping block as the bait.)  Rybka scores the position at -0.43.} 21. h3 {White:  After many days mediation, this move appears the best way to deal with the unfortunate turn of events.  Rybka agrees this is best.  Before making this move, I spent most of my time worrying about vulnerability of pawns on the queen side and the danger of e4 attacking my beautiful bishop and threatening an attack on my Queen.  Then I notice the rook could move to the king side and support a large attack there.     With h3, the plan is subtle but effective for three reasons:  (1) It eliminate one square (g4) from black’s already cramped bishop [and eliminates this useful square for black’s queen and rook as well].   (2)  White prefers to keep all his big pieces where they are, but doing nothing is not usually a winning strategy in chess.  This does something:  it advances a pawn.  If Black does nothing monumental next move, g4 chases off the bishop furthering the pawn advance.  (3) It gives the King a crucial escape square which is fully utilized later in the game.  White normally resists moving the three pawns in front of the king, but in this case, black has no dark-square bishop, and no easy way for black to exploit the hole created, and the advantages all outweigh the costs.  It also has the advantage of possibly lulling in the opponent to thinking white is being careless.} Qg6 {Black: ? I was blinded by the promise of converting my little advantage into a free pawn and missed the much better Qd6! Threatening the b pawn, further securing the central file and mounting more pressure on that e pawn. After 22. a3 Rd8 and white cannot protect that backwards e pawn without trapping his own white bishop on d2, allowing either black to use the extra tempo to protect the king with something like h6 or something more aggressive like e4! Winning the centre.  White: Rybka ranks them in this order: -0.40 Red8; -0.40 Qg6; -0.39 Qd6  White sees the advantage of Red8 as it centralizes power on the middle file contesting the other side from white and helps to address the back rank problem that becomes an issue later for Black (and thought black should have done this instead of Rfe8 before). White was anticipating these moves, none of which Rybka finds as favorable: attacks/advances: Rh4(0.21), Qh4(0.95), e4(1.53); defense of back rank: g6 (escape square)(0.16), Kf8 (defends rook in event of attack and centralizes king for end game)(-0.18)} 22. Be4 {White was pleased with this response: cuts off Rook from the attack, entices rook off of central square, and for White's d-pawn to capture move of the d-file and enable mobilization of doubled rooks to attack the back rank. Black can't ignore the aggressive bishop, another piece again threatening the Queen. Ryka also finds this the optimum move.} Bxe4 { Rybka agrees this is the best move. Still at -0.40} 23. dxe4 {White: The moment White was looking for. The pawn has moved on and the doubled rooks are mobilized for action rather than stuck at a road block.   } Rxc4 {Black: c5 might have been stronger.  White: Rybka agrees that c5 is much stronger (-0.49) vs. Rxc4 (0.13). Rybka's other choices: Qxe4 (-0.04) and Rxe4 (0.04). c5 would have solidified the lockhold the rook has on the center and avoid the temptation to leave to take a “free” pawn.  Black: funilly enough enough i considered Qxe4 for a while, but worried about an invasion onto my back rankwith my queen stuck infront of my e pawn.} 24. Rd2d8 {White is more than happy to lose a pawn to have the troublesome rook out of the way and to gain access to the bank rank and pin the rook against the King. Rybka gives White back a half pawn of advantage here. White wonders if black is aware the back Rook is pinned (and fears saying anything that might reveal this and have black correct the problem by creating an escape square for King or protecting the Rook).} Qe6 {White: Black has unpinned the Rook, but White was still uncertain if this is part of some other plan and by coincidence. White expected f6, f5, h6, h5 or Kf8. Rybka finds f6 best at (0.12), then Kf8 (0.36) and Qe6 at (0.37).    If black had tried the best move f6, white would have responded with Qb3 (pinning the other rook too!) or Qd3 (tripling the heavy pieces on the d-file).  Although all very exciting and the appearance of a strong attack, Rybka finds these responses to f6 basically a tie. However, with the actual move Qe6, Rybka says white has nearly half a pawn edge. } 25. Rd1d6 {White: The Queen that unpins the Rook must go somewhere else!  (However, Rybka prefers 25. Qb3 (0.36) b5 26. R1d6 vs. 25. R1d6, perhaps because b5 weakens the pawn queen-side pawn structure. )} Qe7 {White: Rybka agrees this this the ONLY move.   Black: my only option really, my main worry now becomes the g5 square. a queen secured on that could cause some major hassle for me. i played this line in the ( foolish) hope that white might be tempted to give me a position where i could swap the two rooks for the queen (for example, any move here that doesn't put the queen on the d file or move the d8 rook. my insurance policy of Rd4 is about to pay dividends i think!} 26. Rd8d7 {Black: Qg5 is interesting! After  26… f6 27. Rxe8+ Qxe8 28. Rxf6  black seems to have an advantage though the kingside threat is impressive  White:  Although White considered the moves that Rybka prefers here, notabley Qd2, Qd3 or Rxe8+, the exchange doesn’t seem to leave White with any real advantage.   However, Rybka thinks these lines are still better than the above, e.g.     1. = (0.25): 26.Qd2 Rd4 27.Rxd4 exd4 28.Rxd4  4. = (0.08): 26.Rxe8+ Qxe8 27.Qd3 Rd4 28.Rxd4 exd4 29.Qxd4        compared with:   5. = (-0.02): 26.R8d7 Qh4   White thought having the pieces out gave them more power to threaten Black with possible mate.                   Note:  This move is a trap:  26. R6d7 Qxd8 27. Rxd8 Rxd8, costing white the two connected rooks in exchange for a Queen, leaving blacks’ Rooks ready to pounce on the back rank.  Black and White had longs discussions over whether this was playable for White, and eventually agreed it was not.  Rybka rates it at   -1.53.} Qh4 {White:  Qh4 is best move.  Everything else leads to trouble.  That’s why White liked the last move.  A less astute Black would have probably lost the game here.      Rybka also advocated one more move we probably would never have considered:  Qf8!  But it rates it slightly less at 0.13 compared to almost exactly even for Qh4.} 27. g3 {White:  Rybka prefers these moves:  Qf3 (0.04), Rxa7(-0.13), a3(-0.14), f3(-0.20), Qd2(-0.29),b5(-0.35).  g3 it rates as -0.50.  White doesn’t discover the back door attack on the a-file until next move.   White had considered Rxa7 but only to get a pawn which seemed insufficient.  White wanted something grander.     The idea was to chase the Queen from protecting against Rd8.  If 27. … Qxh3 28. Rd8, and black was going to lose the Rook at e8.  However, Rybka says that Rf8 addresses the problem., but after a difficult fight for survival:  29. Rxf8+ Kxf8 30. Kxd8 Qg8+ 31. Qg5+ f6 32. Qxg7 Kxd8 33. Qg8+ Ke7  34. Qxc4.  White’s being down a pawn puts White behind at -0.44.} Qh5 {Black:Qh5?? What was black thinking! Qxh3 is much stronger  White:  Rybka advocated  Qxh3, the move White expected.  } 28. Rxa7 {White: White is now probably at the peak of this game.   Rybka ranks the position at 0.84.  Unfortunately, finding the best move is no easy task!   White considered many moves and lines:  28. Qf3 Qxf3 29. Rd8 f6 30. Rxe8+ Kf7 31. Rde6 Rc1+ 32. Kh2 Qh1#  28. Qd2 Kf8  29.  Rd8 f6 30. Rxe8+ Qxe8 31. Rd8 Rd4 32. Rxd4 exd4              33. Qxd4                              28. g4  Qh4  29.Qg3 Rc1+ 30. Rd1 Rxd1+ 31. Rxd1                28. Rd8 then Kf8, f6 or f5.                28. Rd8 f6  29. Qb3 b5                28. Re7 Kf8     In the investigation of 28. Re7 Kf8, White discovered that 29. Rxa7 did more than gain a pawn, but enables a  backdoor attack with 30. Qa3.  Why waste a move with Re7?  Why not go straight to Rxa7 or Qa3?                                 Rybka says the best move is (White is still incredulous):   Kg2 (0.84) or g4               (0.55).      White ultimately chose Rxa7 over Qa3, because he didn't want to tip his hand, and feared Qxh3 would limit queen's ability to support an attack, having to focus instead on defence.  Rybka gives Rxa7 followed by Qxh3 a score of 0.00—dead even.  Black: yeh black is in trouble here. g4 was something i considered and worried about for a fair while - where's the queen to go? perhaps h3 hoping that the rook can make it to C2 and that white will move the queen? or that white's rook will neatly remove itself from the D file so it can get out to help? but after that the move f6 is no longer as useful as it could be and white simply picks off the pawns on teh queenside and marches home - there's just not a nice answer to g4 here.} Rxb4 {Black: why do i persist in ignoring the h3 pawn? mainly because i'm too woried about a queenside pawnstorm - and also the possibility of a queen supporting the rooks after Qxb6. the main idea behind this move though was essentially agressive in nature - i want to get that rook ont eh back and seventh rank. and this way (i thought) meant that white couldn't stop a potentially tempo winning attack on the 1st rank.  White:  Rybka agrees that Qxh3 was the best choice.  White was pleased this less important pawn was captured instead.} 29. Qa3 {Black: white lets black off here a bit, g4 is much stronger.  White:  Although this is the attack White longed for, Rybka say, no, focus on pawns instead.   g4 scores  0.68.  This move rates -1.75, because of  29. ... Rb1+ 30. Kg2 31. Ra8 Qe4+!  which disables White's attack.   White had overlooked Qe4+ or Qf1+ (a less attack keeping things at even) and expected to gain the pinned rook.} Rd4 {White:  Black appears to have overlooked the prospects of the Rb1+ line as well.  Black: i considered it- in fact it was one of the main points of Rxb4 - however i hadn't noticed the way that the queen could get in to help as i had my eyes on h3 (finally) and hadn't seen that on e2 i could do just as much damage. darn.} 30. Rxd4 {White:  Once again Rybka says g4 is the move, somehow making the Ra8 attack work or force Black's queen to exchanged with White's rook.  Rybka rates the move g4 at 4.18.  Taking the Rook instead only leaves white at a slight disadvantage  (-0.41).} exd4 31. Ra8 {White over looked 31. ... Qe5 and perhaps also f5 or f6 to protect the rook.} Qe5 {White:  Rybka now rates the position at -1.05} 32. Qd6 {Black: ?? This is a blunder for white. With Rxe8 this would have been much closer.  White:   Agrees.  White flustered by the unexpected Qe5, hurriedly moves thinking queens can't be exchanged.  Thinking RxR would be mate, forgetting, Qf8 defence.  Rybka advocate Qa4.  Instead, the position is rated as -3.2.} Qxd6 {White: The rest from here is easy for black with those two passed pawns. The best white can do is force black to retreat the king and capture a kingside pawn before helping the passed pawns to the end as with a move like 40. g4 etc. though this is a temporary reprieve, as … c3 traps the white king within two squares of c1.  Black: it wasn't completely obvious that black could take the queen - it occurred to me only after i was almost resigned to loosing a rook! however i think this is the move that removes all white's chances in this game - the c, d and b pawns are just too strong against that lonely a pawn.  however a very close game - with white more often than not ahead.} 33. Rxe8+ Qf8 34. Rxf8+ Kxf8 { The rest from here is easy for black with those two passed pawns. The best white can do is force black to retreat the king and capture a kingside pawn before helping the passed pawns to the end as with a move like 40. g4 etc. though this is a temporary reprieve, as from 37 onwards … c3 traps the white king within two squares of c1.} 35.
