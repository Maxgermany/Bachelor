[Opening "Philidor (C41), exchange variation"]

1. e4 {I had white pieces and started with e4.} e5 {stegal played e5, very standard move} 2. Nf3 {Nf3 was played, attacking e5 pawn.} d6 {black played d6, indicates that he is going for Philidor's defense.  } 3. d4 {I played d4, challenging the e5 pawn immediately, also making way for the lsb.} exd4 {exd4 was played, this is known as the exchange variation of Philidor's defense.} 4. Nxd4 {Nxd4, stand move.} c5 {This move actually surprise me, black didn't play a normal looking move such as Nf6 or g6, but c5 was played, attacking the knight. } 5. Nf3 {Nf3 was played, this wasn't an accurate move, may be Bb5+ is stronger, because Nf3 allows black to play Bg4. } Bg4 {Bg4, pins the knight :(} 6. Be2 {Be2 unpin, but I really don't like the position of my lsb :(} Bxf3 {To my surprise again, Bxf3 was played! black gives up his lsb. If I were black I would keep the lsb, instead of playing bxf3 I would play g6 and prepare for Bg7, because pawns on c5 and d6 is blocking the dsb. Bg7 allows the dsb to work on a better diagonal.} 7. Bxf3 {never mind, Bxf3} Nc6 {Nc6 develops the knight.} 8. Nc3 {develop my knight} Nf6 {more developing move from black} 9. Bg5 {Bg5, develop my dsb and pin the knight.} Be7 {be7 unpins, also black is now ready to castle king side.} 10. Qd2 {Qd2, preparing queen side castle, safety first, so i can then launch the attack on black king.} O-O {O-O!} 11. O-O-O {O-O-O! :D} h6 {I almost fall off my chair after I saw this move!! "this must be a mistake!"   I said to myself} 12. Bxh6 {Bxh6 was played, sacrifice the bishop and hoping for black to open up the g file. } gxh6 {gxh6 !} 13. Qxh6 {Qxh6} Nh7 {Nh7, Bg5 is coming, forking white's queen and the king} 14. Kb1 {Kb1 problem solved } Bg5 {Bg5, attacks the queen.} 15. Qh3 {i didn't find a better move than Qh3} Ne5 {Ne5, attacks the bishop, I can't allow this exchange, because I'm already down a piece.  } 16. Bh5 {So Bh5 was played, now I'm a bit worried, because black now have the initiative, I must find a way to continue the attack.} a6 {a6 was played, I wasn't sure why black played this move, seems that black is preparing for b5, pawnstorms my queen side?} 17. Qg3 {Qg3, pins the dsb, either f4 or h4 is coming next} Kh8 {black played Kh8 unpins, I thought it is a mistake at the beginning, because f4 forks the knight and bishop. } 18. f4 {f4, but then I realized black does not need to worry at all, because he still have Bh4, attacks white queen } Bh4 {Bh4} 19. Qe3 {Qe3, this is definitely not a good move, because Nc4 can be very annoying, maybe due to the time pressure, I made this silly move} Nc4 {yep, here it comes, my queen got chased around.} 20. Qe2 {Qe2 attacks the knight, but this provoke b5} b5 {b5 } 21. Rhg1 {Rhg1, I had to carry on with my own attack, time is "pressure"!! } Qe7 {Qe7, reasonable move, connecting the rocks.} 22. g4 {g4, supports the lsb, but also going for g5, cut off the communication between the bishop and the black queen} Bf6 {Bf6, rerouting the bishop and now it is aiming at my queen side.} 23. Nd5 {Nd5 forks the queen and the bishop, the knight is also gonna join the attack.} Qd8 {Qd8, its tempting to capture the dsb, because both black knight and bishop are attacking b2 pawn, but I didn't capture the bishop, and this turned out to be the correct choice.  } 24. g5 {g5 sacrificing b2 pawn and adding more pressure to the black king side. } Bxb2 {Bxb2} 25. g6 {g6, i wanted to open up g file completely.} fxg6 {fxg6 was played} 26. Bxg6 Ra7 {Ra7 gives more protection to the knight} 27. Rg3 {Rg3, so I can bring the rook to h3 to help the attack, also my rook is now guarding the 3rd rank.} Rg7 {Rg7, Rfg8 is coming, attacking the bishop.} 28. f5 {f5, supports the bishop, also my rook is now free to move :D} Be5 {Be5 attacks the rook.} 29. Rh3 {I was going to play Rh3 anyway.} Na3+ {Na3+ } 30. Kc1 {Kc1 is the only move} Nc4 {knight back to c4, black would play Qa5 sooner or later.} 31. Rg1 {Rg1, I got no time to waste, I was quite low on time, so I must focus on the attack.} Qa5 {Qa5, and Qxa2 is coming, and that could be a disaster, to find the next move I spent about 2 minutes (I had less than 3 minutes on the clock).} 32. Qh5 {I was thinking If I could break h7, there must be something good, clock is ticking, I calculated 4 moves ahead, alright it's all or nothing! Here its goes, Qh5!} Qxa2 {Qxa2 Mate in one threat.} 33. Qxh7+ {but I got the killa move! Qxh7+} Rxh7 {Forced} 34. Rxh7+ {We can see where this is going now} Kg8 {Forced again, it's the only move!} 35. Ne7# {Now you see why I didn't take the dsb with my knight is actually the right move. Game over stegal said gg even though he lost the game, a dude with good manner.  }
