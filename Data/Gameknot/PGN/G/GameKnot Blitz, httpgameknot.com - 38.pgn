[Opening "Van't Kruijs opening (A00)"]

1. e3 d5 2. c4 Nf6 3. cxd5 Nxd5 {Moving twice the knight in the very opening... but after Qxd4, white has an easy developement kicking the queen. } 4. Bc4 Bf5 {I knew this move would have surprised my opponent...} 5. d3 {Logical, trying to develop threatening a fork, but...} Nb6 6. Bb5+ {White is about to lose the d3 pawn... and he has to struggle to save it!} c6 7. e4 {Bxe4, dxB, QxQ, KxQ, cxB would have been ok for black, I think. } cxb5 8. exf5 {But I liked to scramble white's game.} Qd5 9. Qf3 {Interesting and seldom seen.} e6 {Another "surprise" move. } 10. Nc3 {Bb4 could have been an option. } Qxf5 11. Qxb7 {Oh, yes, but...} Bc5 {Threatening a lot on f2} 12. Ne4 Bb4+ 13. Bd2 Bxd2+ 14. Kxd2 {Interesting, trying to activate the rook soon, but look at this poor isolani... and ah, yes, I have to free my queenside pieces, and take care of Nd6+, royal fork. } Qd5 15. Qxd5 Nxd5 {Now, I can confidently say that black is better. } 16. Nd6+ Ke7 17. Nxb5 {White recovers the pawn, but the isolani would be a headache for white. } a6 18. Nd4 {Nf4 threats g2, but g3 is enough to kick my knight before I can use it against d3. } Rd8 {A tempo for preparation (now I do threat Nf4, winning a pawn). } 19. Ngf3 f6 {Another preparation move. } 20. Rac1 {Better to consolidate the d pawn, with Ke2, for Rd8. Maybe. } e5 {I expected Re8 (Kf8)} 21. Nc6+ Nxc6 22. Rxc6 Nf4 23. Rc3 {g2 is taboo, of course (Rg1, then Rxg7)} Rab8 24. b3 e4 25. Nh4 {Rd1 would have been better. I would have answered Rb4, and if f3... well, a hell of a thinking :-)  } Nxd3 26. Nf5+ Kf8 27. Ke3 g6 28. Nd4 Rd6 {If Kxe4, Nxf2+, forking the rook. } 29. Kxe4 {A pity. } Nxf2+ {}
