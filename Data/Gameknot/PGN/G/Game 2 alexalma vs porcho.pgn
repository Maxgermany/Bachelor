1. d4 d5 2. c4 dxc4 {queens gambit accepted} 3. e4 {standard} e5 {interesting, i like when people play this because I like to push d4-d5, then take on c4 giving me good control over the center} 4. d5 c6 {interesting} 5. Bxc4 {this adds another defender to the pawn} Nf6 {another attacker} 6. Nc3 {another defender} Bb4 7. Bd2 {defends the pin and if he plays Bxc3 Bxc3 Nxe4 Ill play Bxe5} Bxc3 8. Bxc3 cxd5 {trading pawns but I don't think he should do it because it puts my bishop in a powerful position} 9. Bxd5 {taking back as well as defending my pawn} Qd6 {defending his pawn} 10. Nf3 {adding another attacker and he won't be able to defend the pawn} Be6 {This was his only major mistake losing him a rook} 11. Bxb7 {and now he pretty much has lost} Qxd1+ {? trading down while losing} 12. Kxd1 O-O 13. Bxa8 {taking his rook while always defending e4 I can take e5 because I have 2 attackers and he has no defenders} Rd8+ {no reason for him to check } 14. Kc2 {I felt this was the best place to move} Rc8 {pinning my bishop} 15. Nxe5 {I take his pawn and am up seven points, he probably won't come back, thanks for watching and great game by Porcho.}
