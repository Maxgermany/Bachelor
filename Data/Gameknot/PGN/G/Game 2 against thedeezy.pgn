1. e4 {I play this in hopes of King's Gambit (a personal blitz favorite).} c5 {ugh...I don't know but the first few moves...I was scared.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 {Book, until I throw him for a loop.} 4. Bc4 {Instead of retaking, I explode onto the offensive.} e5 5. Ng5 Nh6 6. Qf3 {f7 is now the object of my obsession.} f6 7. Qh5+ Ke7 {I thought he would play g6, but this suits me just fine!} 8. Nf7 Qa5+ {Didn't see this.} 9. c3 Rg8 {Okay, I'll remove the working piece!} 10. Nxh6 gxh6 11. Qf7+ Kd8 12. Qxf6+ {Equalizing.} Ne7 {Why not with the Bishop?} 13. Bxg8 dxc3 {I thought for a while upon seeing this move, before I played} 14. Qxf8+ {One escape route.} Kc7 15. Nxc3 Nc6 16.
