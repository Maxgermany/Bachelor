1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {Book.} a6 3. a3 e6 {This is author Tony Kosten's recipe for the English but as black except that black would have already played g6 and Bg7.} 4. Nf3 Nc6 {This is the problem I see with many authors stated aims of the English and Sicilian.  If the aim is the control of d4 for black or d5 as white, it seems that white already controls the d4 square.} 5. O-O g6 {This is partly an effort to control d4, but d4 is not controllable by black unless white releases it.} 6. d4 cxd4 {Center pawn for wing pawn.} 7. Nxd4 Bg7 8. Nxc6 {I suspect that c3 is better.} bxc6 9. c3 {He plays c3 anyway.} Ne7 10. Be3 d5 11. exd5 cxd5 12. Ba2 O-O 13. Bd4 {I was hoping to play Nf5 prior to his attempt here.} e5 {I might still be able to play it.} 14. Bc5 Be6 {Now there are two defenders.  He can remove one.} 15. Nd2 Re8 16. Nf3 Nf5 17. Qc2 Nh4 {I maintain a good center, but it is basically even.} 18. Nxh4 Qxh4 19. Rad1 d4 20. Bxe6 Rxe6 {Bye bye light square bishops.} 21. cxd4 exd4 22. Rd3 Rc8 {Forcing him to take with the rook or not at all.} 23. b4 a5 24. g3 Qe4 25. Rfd1 axb4 26. axb4 Qd5 {I happen think this move quite fair.} 27. Qd2 Rce8 {The d pawn is lost.  I could try to reinforce it, but the position is rather passive.  My attack could be in trouble.} 28. h4 Re6e2 {Interesting at least.  White has several tries and some should offer good play.  29.Rxd4 Bxd4 30.Qxd4 and the black queen can flee with modest compensation.  But I find 29.Qc3! interesting.} 29. Qf4 {Black has mate in 3.} Re2e1+ 30. Kh2 {Or we can shorten the path to mate.  He actually resigned after this move preceded with a gg comment.  Due to the implementation of gameknot's current live chess games, resigned mere moments before I found the reason for the gg.  My idea had been on Rh1, but Qh1 works better.  I played it, but he resigned a split second before.} Qh1# {#}
