[Opening "Queen's gambit declined (D30)"]

1. d4 {I start with my regular queen's pawn opening and hope for d7d5 so I can play the queen's gambit.} d5 {He obliges} 2. c4 e6 {Hmm, last game he accepted, this time he declined.} 3. e3 {Sometimes I play this, sometimes I play Nc3. The always both get played, but sometimes the move order is different.} Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Qb3 {When black moves his bishop to b4 to pin my knight, I often play this so that if he exchanges I don't get doubled pawns or isolated pawns. This also threatens his bishop, and supports my c pawn.} a5 6. a3 {With my queen defending my knight, I can safely chase away the bishop.} Bd6 7. Bd2 Ne4 8. Bd3 {Better would have been Nxe4 as this allows him to displace my king.} Nxd2 9. Kxd2 O-O 10. Nf3 {I complete minor piece development and have a major developmental advantage over him.} f6 11. cxd5 {I notice I have enough attackers to win a pawn here.} Re8 {He doesn't bother to recapture.} 12. Rhe1 e5 {I don't like this, It allows me to undouble my pawns.} 13. dxe5 fxe5 14. Qc2 {I threaten Bxgh7+} Nd7 {He misses it} 15. Bxh7+ Kf8 16. Qf5+ {I continue my attack} Nf6 17. Qg6 {Looking for an opening and getting out of the way of the discovered attack.} c6 18. Ng5 {I bring another attacker into play and threaten mate} Ke7 {Allows mate in one, better would have been Qd7. We are now playing a tiebreaker game that I will annotate after it's finished.} 19. Qf7# {}
