1. e4 {I was White in this game against my computer. I played a risky sacrifice because computers are known to overvalue material.} c5 {Sicilian Defense. The most common response to e4.} 2. Nf3 {Developing move.} d6 3. d4 {Opening lines for development.} cxd4 4. c3 {Instead of wasting a tempo taking the pawn, I offer the computer my pawn to for a lead in development.} Nf6 {Doesn't immediately take, but attacks my pawn.} 5. e5 {The only way to keep the initiative.} dxe5 6. Nxe5 {Black can't immediately take my pawn because of Qxd8  Kxd8 Nxf7  1-0} Qa5 {Black is attacking my knight, so...........................} 7. Bf4 {...................I develop a piece to defend it. Development is the most important part of the opening, and can often lead to pretty wins like this one.} dxc3 {Black accepts the pawn sacrifice, but is wasting moves that could've been used developing, and giving me a lot more central control and easier lines for development.} 8. Nxc3 Nc6 {Black should be developing his kingside pieces to castle there, because my strongly placed pieces will attack the uncastled king.} 9. Bb5 {I develop a kingside piece while adding pressure to Black's queenside. } Ne4 {Black shouldn't move the same piece twice in the opening, unless it will strongly place your piece. Most computers don't know that.} 10. O-O {Every single one of my moves have been strong developing moves that control everywhere, so therefore I can castle before Black. Notice how we both had pressure on the c-file knights with pins against the king? Now since I have castled first, my pressure on the c-file knight and Black's underdeveloped queenside will allow me to take advantage of Black's uncastled king. } Nxc3 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. bxc3 Qxc3 13. Rc1 {A developing move with tempo.} Qb2 {Black has wasted to many moves. Now he doesn't have time to castle.} 14. Nxc6 {Threatening Qd8.} Bb7 15. Qa4 {If Black tries to escape with f6, then Na5 is a discovered check winning a piece.} Bc8 {Notice how Black can't develop because of all my tactical threats.} 16. Ne5+ {It's over.} Qb5 {Computer has already calculated the mate, so by the way it's programmed, it will stall mate for as long as possible.} 17. Qxb5+ Kd8 18. Nxf7# {Black's king is very exposed and my developing active pieces were crushing. Black didn't have time to develop the kingside because I had so many tactical threats on the queenside. }
