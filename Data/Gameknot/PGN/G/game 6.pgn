1. e4 {i am sure on the name of this opening i bet someone will tell me it eventually but it was smooth sailing. i was goin for a king, bishops gambit my favorite set up but i was forced to do it solo.} c6 {not the answer i wanted but not a burden either} 2. f4 d5 {nothing big still i figur ill take a traditional king's gambit set up and adept it} 3. d3 Nf6 {well i know that nc3 is not a good move here so i figure more pawn moves} 4. e5 Nfd7 {well this helps now, i can catch up on developement.} 5. Be3 e6 {opening bishop lines} 6. Nf3 {just putting pieces out into the center} f6 7. Nc3 Bb4 {the obvious pin} 8. Qd2 c5 9. d4 {avoiding the fork} c4 {this hurts, now my bishops both suck.} 10. a3 {might aswell boot his bishop} Bxc3 11. Qxc3 {this helps atleast the queen can get around} a5 12. Be2 {maybe try going the other way.} O-O 13. O-O b5 {closing of the side} 14. b4 axb4 {this series of moves was all i wanted and needed now my rooks can take the express route into the game.} 15. axb4 Rxa1 16. Rxa1 Na6 {talk about road-block. :(} 17. Nh4 {making room for bishop} fxe5 18. Nf3 {or not} exf4 19. Bd2 {my pieces are getting pushed around} Nf6 20. Bxf4 {thx} Ne4 21. Qe3 Nxb4 22. Ra7 {gotta avoid the fork} Nxc2 {oh my she has  no nice squares well i got a last ditch idea here.} 23. Rxg7+ {i assumed he would take.} Kh8 24. Qc1 Nxd4 {odd still not the rook?} 25. Be5 {guard it and set up the future} Nf6 26. Qh6 {now my last ditch is becoming a future mate} Nf5 {ouch nice fork too bad you will not get it.} 27. Rxh7+ {pins the knight} Kg8 28. Qg6+ {forces the end of the game} Ng7 29. Qxg7# {i really enjoyed how my last dicth attempt became the winning move.}
