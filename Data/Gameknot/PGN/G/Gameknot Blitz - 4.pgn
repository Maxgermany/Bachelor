1. e4 d5 2. exd5 {I went with the Scandinavian defence. I did not want to move my queen in the early game and decided to attack the pawn with my knight.} Nf6 3. c4 {He protects it and opens a way for his queen to move out.} c6 {I offer my c pawn and he takes it} 4. dxc6 e5 {and my b pawn too!} 5. cxb7 Bxb7 {Even tough I am down by two pawns I got a lot of space and developed my white bishop and the king-side knight Usually I only give up my c pawn and develop my knight. I wanted to try something which is new to me so let's see what is going to happen next. } 6. Nf3 e4 7. Qe2 {I move forward aggressively} Bd6 8. Ng5 O-O 9. Nc3 Re8 {protecting that pawn, it seemed that my pawn sacrifice at the beginning did not work out as well as I hoped.  I plan is to get them away from the centre.} 10. b3 h6 11. Nh3 Qc7 12. Bb2 {white wisely develops his bishop. We each have a nice diagonal now. I hesitate and don't know what to do next. The double threat on his h2 pawn comes to mind. I am down to pawns, so why not grab it?} Bxh2 13. g3 {This looks bad at first but tuns out that he had made a mistake, trying to block my bishop on his way out.} Bxg3 14. fxg3 Qxg3+ 15. Nf2 e3 {I belive he did not want to move his king and give up the option to castle long. His knight is trapped. } 16. O-O-O exf2 17. Qxe8+ Nxe8 {Blunder by my opponent. } 18. Rh3 Qg4 19. Re3 Nf6 20. Bh3 Qh4 21. Nb5 {If I would have moved my king to f8 I would have prevented some material loss.  I just did not see it then ...} Nbd7 22. Nd6 Bc6 23. Nf5 Qg5 24. Ne7+ {Here is the fork. My bishop is lost.} Kh8 25. Nxc6 Ng4 {I am angry and ready to attack !} 26. Rg3 Ndf6 {He starts trading. I have to accept since I moved forward a little quickly.} 27. Bxf6 Qxf6 28. Rxg4 Qxc6 29. Bg2 Qc8 30. Bxa8 Qxg4 {Still leading by two points I am happy that I managed to trade equally.  I kept moving all my pawns forward and white resigns when he was loosing his rock which was blocking the f pawn. I think the start of the game is more interesting. Do you think this kind of opening would work in a regular game?? }
