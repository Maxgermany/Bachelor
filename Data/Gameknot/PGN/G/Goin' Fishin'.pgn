[Opening "Caro-Kann (B10), Hillbilly attack"]

1. e4 {My opponent opens with a standard e4 } c6 {Caro-Kann, my favorite defense. } 2. Bc4 {not my choice move but i guess there are worse moves out there. } d5 {Standard } 3. exd5 {Personally i think this variation only benefits Black. } cxd5 4. Bb5+ {enticing the further exchange of pieces... } Bd7 5. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {So now both light squared bishops are off the board. } 6. d4 Ngf6 {Standard development } 7. Nf3 e6 8. O-O Bd6 {Aiming down at the h2 square. I'm also getting ready to get my Rook over to the c file. } 9. b3 Qc7 {Piling up on the h2 square. } 10. Bb2 {The fianchetto doesn't really help white out in this situation, in my opinion. The bishop is blocked by his own pawn. } Rc8 {Now i have a couple threats at c2 and h2. } 11. Nc3 {Blocks the c2 threat and develops. } Ng4 {Further pressure is added to h2. I think my position is looking rather nice right about now. } 12. h3 {Tries to remove an attacker. } h5 {The Knight is poisoned, taking will result in a worse position for white. } 13. hxg4 {Unfortunately for him, he doesn't see the danger in taking. } hxg4 {Threatening the capture of the Knight. More importantly, it opens the h file for my Rook. White is in some serious trouble... } 14. Ne5 {An attempt to block off the diagonal; however, white's fate is sealed. } Bxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5 {White can't prevent the mate. } 16. g3 {Stalls for a turn. } Qh5 {And this fish is fried... }
