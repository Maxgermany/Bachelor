1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I was thinking about the thread in my Club about which piece you would rather have in a B v N endgame.  Many people would say the bishop!  Well, I had the bishop, my opponent had the knight (and the lower chess rating at the time the game was played!) and I lost!  Here is how it happened.  The first three moves are the French Exchange Variation so I start commentary on move 4.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. Nf3 {4. Nf3 - development.} Bd6 5. c4 c6 6. Nc3 {6. Nc3 - more development and pressure upon d5.} Ne7 7. Bd3 dxc4 8. Bxc4 {8. Bxc4 - pawn trade.} Nd7 9. O-O O-O {9. ..... 0-0 - both sides tuck their kings away on the kingside.} 10. h3 Nb6 11. Bb3 {11. Bb3 - b3 is almost a standard square for a white bishop in the Ruy Lopez opening.} Ned5 12. Re1 Bc7 13. Ne5 Be6 14. Nxd5 Bxd5 15. Bxd5 Nxd5 {15. ..... Nxd5 - there have been a plethora of exchanges and now there are two enemy cavalry standing side by side.  My knight could be driven off e5 at any time though.  Xeno's cannot and this is the start of another attack of passivitis for yours truly.} 16. Qb3 Bb6 17. Be3 Qc7 18. Nc4 {18. Nc4 - my knight moves off e5 to rid myself of that turbulent dark square prelate on b6.} Rfe8 19. Nxb6 axb6 20. a3 Qd6 21. Rad1 b5 {21. ..... b5 - preparing Nb6 which hits the squares a4 and c4 and there is nothing I can do about it.} 22. Bd2 Nb6 23. Bb4 Qd5 {23. .... Qd5 - offering a queen trade which for once I decline!} 24. Qg3 Qd7 25. Bc3 {25. Bc3 - Fou Lenoir becomes a giant pawn!} Nd5 26. Bd2 f6 27. f3 Rad8 28. Rxe8+ Rxe8 {28. ....Rxe8 - rook trade.} 29. Re1 Rxe1+ 30. Qxe1 {30. Qxe1 - after this queen trade I offer a draw which Xeno declines.  Over the next few moves he gives me the reason why he declined.} Qe7 31. Qxe7 Nxe7 32. Kf2 {32. Kf2 - I try and do the sensible thing, bring Henry out into the centre asap, but alas that not so black beauty will soon impede his path.} Nd5 33. g4 Kf7 34. f4 f5 35. Kf3 Ke6 {35. .... Ke6 - now out comes the BK and he will be more than a handful to me.} 36. g5 g6 37. Ke2 b6 38. Kd3 {38. Kd3 - not a bad square for Henry and the endgame still looks equal, but looks can deceive.} Nc7 39. b3 Kd5 40. h4 Ne6 {40. ..... Ne6 - it is that weak white isolani on d4 which will decide the game in Xeno's favour.  It is beginning to dawn on me that I will soon be in a zugzwang.  Note:  Fou Lenoir est tres Fou!  Porquoi?  Il est sur les memes carr√©s coloeurs de ses pions!  The only pawn I have not on dark squares is the one on b3.} 41. Be3 Nc7 42. Bd2 Ne8 43. Ke3 Nd6 {43. .... Nd6 - heading for e4 - ouch and double ouch!} 44. Kd3 Ne4 45. Be1 c5 {45. ..... c5!! - an excellent move.  Although I will be pleased to get rid of that isolani it will undoable black's pawns on the queenside.} 46. dxc5 Nxc5+ 47. Ke3 Nxb3 48. Bb4 Kc4 49. Bd6 {49. Bd6 - Black's pawns stay doubled but it will only be a matter of time before I lose the pawn on a3.} Na5 50. Bc7 Kc3 51. Ke2 {51. Ke2 - if BxP?? then after 51. ...... Nc5+ Fou Lenoir does not have a prayer!} Nc4 52. Bd8 Nxa3 53. Bxb6 {53. Bxb6 - the pawn on a3 goes for the pawn on b6.  Alas, there is still the black pawn on b5 and as there are still 3 black pawns left on the board I cannot sac Fou Lenoir for the pawn.  It will only delay the end, not prevent it.} Nc4 54. Bc7 b4 55. Be5+ {55. Be5+ - a last gasp trap.  If NxB, trading down to K & P ending, the b pawn will crown but my e pawn would then crown the move after and material would be equal in the Q and P ending.  It was not to be, Xeno simply moved his king and as I said in a previous note, that pawn will crown unless Fou Lenoir sacrifices himself for it, and I reiterate it would only delay the end which I did not wish to do.  It was time to give in gracefully.  Well played Xenophon!  Kind regards Joanne} Kc2 {}
