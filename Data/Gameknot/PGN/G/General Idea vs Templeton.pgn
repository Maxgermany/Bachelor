[Opening "Old Benoni defence (A43)"]

1. d4 {Another queen's pawn opening.  These are getting popular.} c5 {I like Benoni against queen's pawn for a stronger player.} 2. dxc5 {White takes the gambit.} e6 {I prepare to take the center and threaten the lead white c pawn.} 3. Nf3 {No way to protect the c pawn, so white develops.} Bxc5 {This move eliminates the c pawn and is the first step towards attacking the f2 square.} 4. e4 Nf6 {Attacking the e pawn and lining up to attack f2.} 5. Nc3 {Defending the e pawn.} Ng4 {The only reasonable response to this is Be3 which loses a pawn.} 6. Be3 Nxe3 {I chose to attack first with the knight instead of the bishop for two reasons.  First, the bishop is easier to rescue when it eventually gets overwhelmed.  Second, with white's dark bishop gone, my dark bishop becomes more valuable.} 7. fxe3 Bxe3 {The beauty of this position is that as long as I can maintain it, white can't castle.} 8. Qd3 {Attack the bishop, defend the knight.} Qb6 {Attack the b pawn, defend the bishop.  This also opens up Bf2 , robbing white of the ability to castle.} 9. g3 {Preparing the fiachetto the bishop.} d6 {At this point, I had a problem.  I had this great queen-bishop combo lined up, but with *nothing* to support it.  I had to break my other bishop free and get my knight into the game.  My goal was to get my bishop on c6 and my knight on d7.  I strongly considered d5 here, taking the material loss to gain position, but I didn't like the freedom it left the white e/d pawn.  d6 does just as much to free my pieces, and doesn't give away material or position.} 10. Qb5+ {Clearly an attempt to exchange queens.  Fine by me.} Nd7 {My first thought was Bd7, protecting the king and challenging the queen.  The problem is that if white is only looking to exchange queens (which is the only thing that makes sense), then Qxb6 begets axb6, leaving me with doubled pawns on the b rank. I next considered Qc6, which has the same effect, but leaves me with an intact pawn structure.  The problem with this move, though, is that it leaves my queen-side pawns badly underrepresented, and it doesn't do any actual development. Finally I came to Nd6, which defends my king and queen but doesn't challenge the white queen.  Now the effect of Qxb6 is Nxb6, leaving me well balanced and better developed.  As an added bonus, if white gets cold feet about the trade, I have the following possibility: 11. ... Bf2  12. Ke2 Qe3  13. Kd1 Qe1   At worst, it gives white something more to worry about.} 11. Qxb6 {As expected, white trades queens to try to get my bishop out of his hair.} Nxb6 {Because I defended with my knight instead of my light bishop, I can continue to protect my dark bishop and broaden the attack with Nc4.  His only real chance to castle is to also trade bishops with Bb5 .} 12. Rd1 {White has now forfeited his queen-side castle, which means I only have to hold my bishop to the g1-a7 diagonal.} Bc5 {This is the only sensible way to protect the pawn.  I also like it because it lines me up to pin the knight, most likely trading and doubling white's queen-side pawns.  With a one-pawn lead and much better structure, if I can push white just a little further over the edge, I expect to win in the end game.} 13. Nd2 {White blocks the knight pin.} Bd7 {Right now, I have one goal: development.  My knight and dark bishop are well positioned to stir up some trouble, but I have nothing to back them up.  I need to get the rooks into play.  That means castling and getting the white bishop off the back rank.  Since the only interesting move white had was Bc4 , I decided to start with the bishop.} 14. a3 {White prepares for b4 to try to shake my bishop loose.} Na4 {One of my biggest problems in chess has always been being impatient.  Instead of waiting until I have a clear advantage, I make speculative attacks.  This is one of those cases.  I didn't want to give white the chance to get his act together, so I attacked before I was completely ready.} 15. Nb5 {Because of my impatient move, white is given the chance to hang me on my uncastled king.  The danger here is two-fold.  First, Nc7  forks my rook.  Second, Bxb5, Bxb5  wins my knight.} O-O {The only choice I have that doesn't end up in a loss of position or material is to castle short.} 16. Nb3 {White ups the attack, but leaves his e pawn unprotected, sitting right in front of a helpless rook.} Nxb2 {Having already picked a fight, I didn't have much choice but to follow through.  At least I get to retain some control.  The only sensible move for white is Rb1, relieving the stress on my d pawn, and forcing me to retreat or protect the knight.  Rd2 looses the rook to Be3, and capturing with either knight results in a material or positional loss. Alternative: 16. Nb3 Bc6, 17. Nxd6 Rf-d8, 18. Nxc5 Nxc5, 19. Bg2, leaving white finally able to castle and in a generally stronger position.} 17. Rb1 Na4 {By retreating, I defend my dark bishop, and I prepare to further harry the rook.  At this point, I'm looking for Rd1, Bxb5, Bxb5, Nc3, forking the rook, bishop, and e pawn.} 18. Nxc5 {White trades his knight for my dark bishop, hoping finally to be able to castle.} Nxc5 {I take with the knight because I like my d pawn where it is, and because I want to pressure the white e pawn.  The natural response is Bd3, defending the pawn, and (hopefully) opening the path for a king-side castle.} 19. Nxd6 {White instead opts to try to recover the pawn.} Nxe4 {Finally, the white pawn-rook line-up pays off.  The most advantageous line for white is probably Nxb7.} 20. Nxe4 Bc6 {White has taken my knight, but now this pin will result in him losing his.  The net result is that I keep my 2-pawn lead and wipe out the white center.} 21. Bd3 {White decides to dig deeper, meaning this pin will probably trigger the last big piece exchange of the game.} f5 {To me, the most obvious response is for white to caste, surrendering the knight.} 22. Nf2 {White opts to trade his rook for my knight and bishop.  It's an interesting choice.  On the one hand, he trades an inactive rook for my very active bishop and knight.  On the other hand, white's center is gone, and he's just stranded his king in the middle of the board.  White has also recovered the point lost when I took his e pawn, but it's just a point, not a pawn.  To my way to figuring, this move was weak.} Bxh1 {When white claims my bishop, I am left defending the b pawn from the rook, and the e pawn from the bishop.} 23. Nxh1 b6 {I make my pawns self-sufficient to free my rook.} 24. Rb5 Rac8 {Putting the rook on the c file prevents the white bishop from pressuring my e pawn.} 25. Nf2 {White wisely gets his knight out of the corner.} g5 {Unfortunately, I didn't have a clear plan.  I decided to just push with my pawns and see where it got me.} 26. Nd1 {Interrupted by my f pawn, white's knight takes the back roads.} Kg7 {My king is need to support the pawns.} 27. Ne3 {White's knight is still en route, but he stops to be annoying along the way.} Kf6 {Bad move.  Kg6 would have been worlds better.  My worry with Kg6 was that it pins my f pawn to my king, which I was certain would cause problems later.  Instead, I opted to cause problems for myself immediately by blocking my rook's defense of the f pawn.} 28. a4 {White tips his hand.  He's looking to take out my a and b pawns.} Rfg8 {Another bad move.  I was trying to prepare for an assault on the knight, but it should have been obvious that the knight wasn't going to stay put.  Rf-d8 would have been much more productive.} 29. Nc4 {Now white's plan unfolds.  My a and b pawns are toast.  My hope is to recoup the loss with white's g and h pawns.} h5 {I was still grasping for a strategy.  My other alternative was Rg-d8, but seeing as I just put the rook where it was, that seemed wasteful.  It was now time to throw some resources behind what I started.  Advancing the h pawn just strengthens the upcoming pawn assault. At this point, I started doing the math.  If I can trade off enough of the remaining pawns, swap rooks, and trade my rook for the knight or bishop, I can get a draw if worse comes to worse.  My backup plan is now Rc5 to trade rooks.} 30. a5 {And the hammer finally falls.} f4 {I put my faith in the rooks and my pawn push and surrender my 1-point lead.} 31. axb6 axb6 32. gxf4 {I think white was a little worried about what I was up to.  The natural thing would have been to capture my remaining pawn.  Instead, he attacked my f pawn, which is actually what I wanted, because it opens up a file for my rook.} gxf4 33. Nxb6 Rcb8 {I wasn't paying enough attention, and lined up my rook for a king/rook fork by the knight, leaving me even more significantly behind.} 34. Nd7+ Ke7 35. Nxb8 {I don't know whether it was planning or luck, but I'm left with absolutely nowhere to move with any of my pieces.  The rest of the game before I resigned is me looking for something I can move somewhere.} Kf6 36. Nd7+ Ke7 37. Ne5 Kf6 38. Nf3 Re8 39. Rxh5 {}
