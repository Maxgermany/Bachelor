1. b3 {Hi all! This is a game from a while back (actually the sister game to my annotation called Dangerous Deviation) that I flagged for annotation because it showcases a variety of different elements, but revolves around one basic theme: planning. I hope you find it enjoyable and useful! I begin with Larsen's Opening out of a desire to play something new--so White's plan right out of the gate is to fianchetto his QB and reach across the a1-h8 diagonal into the Black kingside. } Nf6 2. Bb2 e6 3. c4 Be7 {Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point. } 4. e4 {Taking advantage of the pin on Black's Knight. White's goals for the opening are to control space (especially the center) and develop his pieces to active locations--nothing special there. } d6 5. h3 {?! This is a waiting move, with thoughts of supporting a push down the kingside eventually (remember the Bb2's purpose), but probably 5.Nf3 is better, just playing simple, clean developing moves. } O-O {Threatening ...Nxe4. } 6. Nc3 c5 {?! With his pawn still on e6 this is okay... but Black must be careful of making his d-pawn backwards and very weak. } 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. d4 {White sees the weakened d6 pawn and decides to open the d-file, anticipating potential play against d6 down the road. } cxd4 9. Nxd4 a6 {Preventing a Nb5 incursion, which would threaten d6. } 10. Nxc6 {?! This seems to bolster the Black d-pawn unnecessarily, without a lot of gain for White. 10.Be2 was probably better. } bxc6 11. Bd3 {The center will open soon as now White cannot stop ...d5, so he prevents a Queen exchange (as with his limited space a Queen trade would favor Black). White's midgame plan is now taking shape: he will place his pieces behind his pawns for an eventual assault through the center and against the BK, using his slight spacial advantage. Then, when he can, he will play e4-e5 to initiate his attack by activating many pieces at once. } e5 {? I just can't get behind this move. Black wants to let his QB out, but the White squares are pretty well locked down already; it's not going to have any prospects on e6. Better was probably 11...Qc7 in preparation for ...d5. The text makes d6 into a weakness again. } 12. O-O Be6 13. f4 {With the Black pawn on e5, White will not be able to push his own, so he removes the blockade. } exf4 14. Rxf4 Qd7 {Considering a sac on h3 to blow the WK's castle wide open. } 15. Qf3 {White develops, defends h3, and puts some indirect pressure on f7 and c6. White's plan here is still simple: if he can coax Black into playing ...c5, he'll load up on the d file and crush the d6 pawn. However, we must assume the opponent will not weaken himself for us--so we prepare for that eventual e4-e5 push to activate all the White pieces at once. } a5 {?! Black aims for some queenside counterplay in an attempt to defuse White's attack. Assuming you're being attacked but not in immediate danger, a counter in another area of the board is a good way to produce complications and ease the pressure. Of course in this case, White can pretty much ignore it as Black has nothing else he can do with that pawn right away. } 16. Re1 Rac8 17. Ne2 {This is White's weakest piece right now, so steps should be taken to better it. It's intending to arrive on f5, via either d4 or g3--and hoping that Nd4 will provoke Black to weaken his d-pawn further with ...c5 along the way. This move also lets White's powerful DSB reach across the board, to e5 and beyond. } Ne8 {A good retreat. Black lets his DSB out and gives some more support to d6, which cannot really advance for fear of e4-e5. } 18. Nd4 {? Mistimed; Black can now force the Knight off the board because the Rf4 is trapped... } Bg5 {! This is a good shot; Black doesn't fall to the temptation of ...c5, which would probably be a fatal mistake because of the backwards d-pawn on the half-open file. Instead, he forces White to trade off the Knight before it can reach f5. } 19. Nxe6 Qxe6 20. Rg4 Bh6 {?! With even material but less activity, Black should be looking to trade down to a simpler position with 20...Bf6. Leaving the White Bishops uncontested along their huge diagonals is a very dangerous proposition.  } 21. e5 {The long-awated e4-e5 push finally arrives, activating White's LSB, Queen, and Rooks. White has been building toward this push all game, and is fully prepared to play it when the opportunity arises. } d5 {Black wants to keep White's pawn on e5 to block out the Bb2, but this advance loses at least a pawn thanks to the trapped Rf8 and Qe6. Then again, I don't see many better options: certainly 21...dxe5 22.Rxe5 looks terrible for White, and leaving things where they are with a consolidating move like 21...g6 will also fail to defend against 22.Bf5! (Note that I don't choose 22.Bf5 in the text, preferring positional superiority over the material--it's not like the Rc8 is a threat).} 22. Ba3 c5 {The only way to save the Rook. } 23. cxd5 Qb6 {White's central push was well-prepared and now he has absolute control over the entire board. This is not because of any particular mistakes Black made-- White simply formed a consistent plan and executed it, resulting in an irresistible center and a vastly better position for all his pieces. } 24. Kh1 Nc7 {The only place the Knight can go, and this also frees the Rf8. However, I think a less obvious move like 24...g6 is worth a look as well here, preventing the WQ from penetrating to f5 (important, as we will see in a moment) and allowing ...Ng7 and possibly an eventual ...f5. } 25. Qf5 {Threatening immediate mate on h7 and also threatening to slide over to h5, driving the Bishop away from any defense of the King (after d5-d6 cuts off the BQ's support). Black's most natural (and best) response is suddenly not really adequate to defend against the powerful White tactical attack that is unfolding thanks to the space and activity granted by his earlier efforts. } g6 26. e6 {! White's Queen obviously cannot be taken as the pawn is pinned, and what's more, 26...fxe6 allows White to tear into the Black position with a Rook sacrifice and a series of mate threats: 26...fxe6? 27.Rxg6+! hxg6 28.Qxg6+ Bg7 29.dxe6 Nxe6 30.Bc4! and while material will remain even (briefly) after the Knight falls, White is very clearly winning. } Bg7 27. exf7+ {! The Queen remains impervious because of the check, and Black cannot take the advanced pawn: 27...Rxf7?? 28.Qxc8+. } Kh8 28. Qd7 Rcd8 29. Qe7 Nxd5 30. Bxc5 {Though Black has avoided the tactical snares, White has converted his attack into a solid two-pawn lead, and now just has to simplify to a winning endgame. This move begins the process rather nicely. In the endgame, White's strategy will be to continue to simplify while keeping pawns on both wings. No more fancy tactics are required for White: he must simply play accurately and avoid any traps that Black sets. } Nxe7 31. Bxb6 Rxd3 32. Rxe7 Rd1+ 33. Kh2 Rf1 34. Re8 {?! Not the best, but fine. There was no way to save the f-pawn, but as long as the a-pawn falls, White will be able to queen without trouble. Better was probably the immediate 34.Bxa5 R8xf7 35.Rxf7 Rxf7 with a tempo up compared to the text. } Rf1xf7 35. Rxf8+ Rxf8 36. Bxa5 Ra8 37. Rg5 Bf6 38. Rd5 {Finding a nice safe light square from which to block the BK from coming queenside. } Kg7 39. Kg3 Ra7 40. b4 Kf7 41. Kf4 Ke6 42. Ke4 h6 43. Rd3 {Preparing to get behind the b-pawn, specifically to a light square (b3) where it can also defend a pawn on a3. White's play is slow and steady and unbreakable; there is simply nothing Black can do to prevent the loss if White continues to play like this; the White pieces just have so much better prospects than the Black ones. } h5 44. Rb3 g5 45. a3 h4 46. Bb6 Ra6 47. Bd4 {Inviting trades, which Black must not take of course. This Bishop is headed for c1, from which to defend a3 and attack g5. } Be7 48. Bb2 Ra4 49. Kf3 Kf5 50. b5 Bd6 51. Bc1 Ra7 52. a4 {?! Almost certainly inaccurate, but White no longer requires perfection. He just needs his b-pawn to stop on a light square rather than a dark square (b7 instead of b6), so that the BK will be forced to abandon the kingside in order to take it. With the WK off the fourth rank, this is an entirely safe move. } Rxa4 53. b6 Ra8 54. b7 Rb8 {White has accomplished his goal: the b-pawn on b7, Black must now bring his King away from the kingside, or else White can simply play Be3-a7 and force a promotion with a winning gain of material. } 55. Rb5+ Ke6 56. Bxg5 Bg3 57. Bf4 Bxf4 {Forced. Now White's win is clear, as his King can remove the h-pawn and then march to victory (or if ...Rh8, g2-g3 wins the h-pawn for free anyway. There's no way for Black to stop both advances. } 58. Kxf4 Kd7 59. Kg4 Kc7 60. Kxh4 Rxb7 61. Rxb7+ Kxb7 62. Kg5 {1-0. The BK cannot reach the h-file in time, and Black resigns. I hope this game proved valuable to someone; I think it shows well the strength of simply outlining plans as each new stage of the game approaches, and then following through. White never did anything spectacular here, just played consistently and with clear goals. Thanks for reading! }
