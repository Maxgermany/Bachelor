1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {Grunfeld defence, exchange variation.} Bg7 7. Bc4 {Classical continuation, usually followed by 8.Ne2. Unlike 7.Nf3, it avoids unpleasant pin after 8. ... Bg4. But in the latest decades 7.Nf3 is also often played.} c5 8. Ne2 Nc6 9. Be3 O-O 10. O-O Bg4 11. f3 Na5 12. Bxf7+ {This move was introduced into Big Chess by A.Karpov in his match against Kasparov in Sevilla, 1987. White wins pawn, but let black to develop the counterplay. The advantage of this move is that it goes away from deeply investigated play after 12.Bb3 cxd4 13.cxd4 Be6, and creates position of another sort.} Rxf7 13. fxg4 Rxf1+ 14. Kxf1 cxd4 {In the match Sevilla 1987 Kasparov played here 14. ... Qd6, which is now considered as the best.} 15. cxd4 e5 16. Rc1 Qd7 17. dxe5 Qxd1+ 18. Rxd1 Nc4 19. Bf4 Nxe5 20. h3 Nc4 21. Rd7 {White retained the pawn and started improving the position. White's advantage is steadily growing.} b5 22. g3 a6 23. Kg2 b4 24. Nd4 a5 25. Ne6 Bc3 26. Ng5 h6 27. Nf7 h5 28. gxh5 gxh5 29. Rc7 Nd2 30. e5 Re8 31. g4 hxg4 32. hxg4 a4 33. g5 Re6 34. Nh6+ Kf8 35. Ng4 Ne4 {Black's position is close to critical, white is going to play 36.Nf6 with mortal threat g5-g6-g7 (36. ... Bxe5? 37. Bxe5 Rxe5 38.Nd7+). Black tries to prevent, but without success. The best move for black would be 35. ... b3 36.axb3 axb3 37.Rb7 (37.Rxc6? b2, and white has to give away  the rook for the pawn b)} 36. Kf3 Nd2+ 37. Ke2 Ne4 38. Kd3 Nxg5 {Black has to sacrifice the Knight for two pawns. Not a bad solution, because it is not easy for white to avoid the draw. If black finds a way to exchange their two pawns to one white pawn, it will be draw, because endgame rook + bishot against rook almost alwais goes to draw. If blach looses both pawns, but finds a way to exchange rooks, it also will be draw, because destination field of white pawn (a8) is of different color than the white bishop. So it will be a tricky task for white to win...} 39. Bxg5 Bxe5 40. Nxe5 Rxe5 41. Bf4 Rb5 {Excellent idea! It turns out that after 42.Kc4 black can play 42. ... b3!!, and after 43.Kxb5 b2 white, having one rook and one bishop more, can't win! 44.Rc1 bxc1Q 45.Bxc1 Kd7, and white cannot take the a4 pawn and prevent black king to get into a8. Great endgame! It looks that there is no way for white to win :-(} 42. Bd6+ Ke8 {This is a fatal mistake. Now white wins.} 43. Kc4 b3 44. Kxb5 b2 45. Re7+ {There is the point. black pawns are stopped. It is very interesting question: what would be the result, if black played 42. ... Kg8? Let's try to continue: 43.Rc8+ Kh7 (43. ... Kf7? 44.Kc4 b3 45.Kxb5 b2 45.Rf8+; 43. ... Kg7? 44.Kc4 b3 45.Kxb5 b2 46.Be5+) The black pawn b4 looks unstoppable, and white could try tosacrifice a bishop for it: 44.Bxb4 Rxb4 45.Kc3 Rh3 46.Rc4 Rxc4 47.Kxc4, in the hope that black king in h7 is to far. But analisis shows that it comes in time: 47. ... Kg7 48.Kb4 Kf7 49.Kxa4 Ke7 50.Kb5 Kd7 51.Kb6 Kc8 - a draw.}
