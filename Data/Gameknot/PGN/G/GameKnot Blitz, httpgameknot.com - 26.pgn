1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nd2 g6 4. e3 Bg7 {So far, nothing too crazy. Neither player is doing much besides developing. } 5. Bd3 {This is the first move that suggests my kingside will become under fire. I did not see it and continued with my development.} O-O 6. h4 {!? This looks pretty sound, but the important thing is that white needs to support the pawn.} c5 {I realized that white will probably try to castle queenside or keep the king in the center. With this in mind I need to open up the queenside and center.} 7. h5 Nxh5 {!? I take the bait. White should have had more pieces lined up to attack and supported the pawn.} 8. Rxh5 {? This looks scary for black but is not sound, even in blitz. The counterplay looks good, but it can be shut down. This is sac #1.} gxh5 9. Qxh5 {This looks bad for black. Try to find his best defense.} f5 {! White's attack just fizzed. Even though as black you are not really supposed to move your kingside pawns, the defense was necessary. White could have continued with g4, but that pawn may just get in the way if it captures f5.} 10. O-O-O {I know white is trying to swing his rook in, but this gives me time to consolidate and counter attack.} Qe8 {My queen is better placed on e8.} 11. Qh2 Nc6 {White was threatening to capture my knight on g8. Bd7 was also an option.} 12. Ngf3 c4 {I decide to push white's bishop back.} 13. Ng5 {Threatening Qxh7#} Qg6 {The seeming best defense. } 14. Nxc4 {? Even though black is up material, I don't think that this is best. It again looks scary but lacks some soundness. Sacrifice #2.} dxc4 15. Bxc4+ {Kh8 is bad since Bf7 threatens the queen. If Rxf7 than Nxf7 wins the exchange back since the black queen must defend h7.} e6 {My bishop is now passive and bad. However, white has almost run out of pieces to attack black with! As weird and passive as black is, white's attack is about to be curbed. } 16. Rh1 {Overpowering h7.} h6 {This is not a difficult move to spot but is very strong. With the f7 square no longer attacked, black's king can escape to the queenside if necessary since black has enough pieces to defend his king.} 17. Nxe6 {Sacrifice #3. I think this is where the position is given to black. } Bxe6 {This exchange is great for black. The white squared black bishop was not very useful. } 18. Bxe6+ Qxe6 19. Bxh6 {Sacrifice #4. It is at this point black starts to see that white's attack lacks power. Even with passive pieces, black can activate his a8 rook.} Bxh6 {Qxh6 is bad since after the queen trade white is toast.} 20. Qg3+ Kh7 {White now has no way to attack. Black can now develop as slow as he pleases and start his attack on white.} 21. Qf4 {This is more of an irritation for black rather than anything useful.} Ne7 22. Kd1 {Keep in mind that Qxa2 is a horrible mistake that leads to black's checkmate.} Nd5 {Ng6 is also a mistake.} 23. Qf3 Rac8 {f4 fails to e4} 24. c3 b5 {If black can open the position up then white will lose.} 25. a3 a5 26. Rh5 b4 27. g4 {Black cannot ignore the g pawn since g5 wins the bishop. Either way though, white will most likely lose due to material.} fxg4 28. Qxd5 {White goes for the knight. This is where the position falls apart for white.} Qxd5 29. Rxd5 Rxf2 {Crucial. } 30. axb4 axb4 31. Rd7+ Kg8 {? Kh8 is better so I can play Rg8.} 32. e4 bxc3 33. bxc3 Rxc3 {White has no way of defending Rc1#} 34. Rd8+ Kh7 35. e5 Rc1# {Good game buddy. That was exciting.}
