1. d4 d6 2. e4 {Im playing as white and i open with my Queens Pawn. He decides to open with the queens defense. As you can see by my games I am a very aggresive player even when playing the queens gambit. I am happy with where I am right now.} Nf6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3 {Were now playing a standard knights game and im just going to wait for my opponent to make a mistake. He is a good player and i never underestimate my opponents. } Bg4 5. Be3 e5 6. Bb5 {This is where I take control of the game. I know that he has his light sqaured bishop pinning down my knight and i also realize that he will want to put an extra defender on the e5 pawn, so i decide to pin his knight to his king. } Nd7 {He now decides to put more protection on his e5 pawn. } 7. dxe5 {I see that what he is up too and i decide to capture e5} Ncxe5 {This is where he blunders. I spot a checkmate oppurtunity and i exploit this weakness} 8. Nxe5 {I capture knight leaving queen open.} Bxd1 {he obviously captures thinking i blundered} 9. Bxd7+ {I then check is King. } Qxd7 {His only option is capture bishop. Had he not captured and moved king i would check with bishop to g5 the he would bring pawn to f6 and then i would be bring C line knight to d5 Check Mate!} 10. Nxd7 {But hes not an idiot and we exchange off pieces} Kxd7 11. Rxd1 Be7 12. Nd5 {I am now up a knight. I know i have the game in the bag so i grind him down} c6 {I decided to exchange pieces} 13. Nxe7 {...as you can see} Kxe7 14. O-O a6 15. Rfe1 {Im now castled my rooks are centralized so i know the game is over.} Rhd8 16. Bb6 Rde8 17. Bc7 d5 18. exd5+ Kd7 19. Rxe8 Rxe8 20. Ba5 cxd5 21. Rxd5+ Kc6 22. c4 b5 23. b3 bxc4 24. bxc4 Rb8 25. g3 Rb1+ 26. Kg2 Rc1 {15 moves later i stopped his pawn from advancing and now im basically going to try and exchange rooks for the next few moves. } 27. Rd3 Rc2 28. Bc3 g6 {Tried to take pawn on g7 } 29. a3 f5 30. Be5 Rxc4 {He finally lets me exchange} 31. Rc3 Rxc3 32. Bxc3 Kd5 33. Kf3 g5 34. h4 g4+ 35. Kf4 Kc4 36. Bb4 Kb3 37. Kxf5 a5 38. Bxa5 Kxa3 39. Kxg4 Ka4 40. f4 {I now know the game is over. Thankyou for watching i hope you enjoyed the game. The beauty of a move lies not in its appearance but in the thought behind it. - Aaron Nimzowitsch   } Kxa5 41. f5 Kb5 42. f6 {}
