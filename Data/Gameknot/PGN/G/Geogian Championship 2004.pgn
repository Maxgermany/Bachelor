1. e4 c5 {Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {Richter-Rauzer variation.} 6. f3 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3 O-O 9. Qd2 a5 10. Bb5 Be6 11. O-O-O Ne8 12. g4 Nc7 {An unlikely manoeuvre that will become clear sooner...} 13. Kb1 Qb8 {Devoted to a future attack.} 14. Bb6 {This move gives away the battle plan of White, you can see how he's desperately trying to prevent the b5-pawn advancing. If he fails, then a full scale attack storms the queenisde.} Rc8 15. Ba4 {We can see here that if the attack on the queenside is stopped, then White marches on the Black king with his pawns, and since Black's pieces are stranded on the other side, you can truly see the importance of the b7-pawn. 15...Nb4 wouldn't succeed because 16.h4 N7a6 17. a3 Nc6 18. Nd5!... with the edge going to White.} Ra6 {(!) More power on the queenside.} 16. Qf2 Na8 {(!) Against all logic, Black corners his own knight for the sake of the b7-pawn.} 17. Be3 Nc7 18. Bb6 {(!) White won't give up!} Na7 {(!) Securing support squares.} 19. Nc1 Na8 {(!)} 20. Be3 b5 {(!) Black pushes, and starts the advance. His knights may be cornered, but that's irrelevant in light of the attack.} 21. Bb3 a4 22. Bxe6 fxe6 23. Nc3e2 {White has been knocked back significantly. His attack hasn't materialised beyond 12.g4...} b4 24. f4 Nb5 {(!) Now Black mobilises strongly.} 25. fxe5 Nc3+ {(!) More problems are rising in White's disintegrating position.} 26. Nxc3 bxc3 27. b3 axb3 28. Nxb3 {A strong weakness on b2 has been made.} Qb4 {(!) Their is no defence for White to stop the Black queen from rwaching a4 or a3.} 29. Bc1 Qa4 30. a3 dxe5 31. Rhf1 {A desperate counter.} Bxa3 32. Bh6 {(?!)} Ra7 {(!) White's counter is defended.} 33. Be3 Bc5 {(!)} 34. Rd3 Qa2+ 35. Kc1 Qa1+ {White resigned, since the forced 36.Nxa1... Leads to 36...Rxa1# A beautiful attack all pinned on the advance of a single pawn!}
