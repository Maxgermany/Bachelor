1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Spanish Game} a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nc3 Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 {I capture hoping to reduce pieces and thus variables.} 7. Qxf3 Qf6 {And making room for Qf6 where an exchange automatically develops my knight.} 8. Qxf6 Nxf6 9. d3 Be7 10. O-O c5 {I push the doubled pawn in a conscious effort to make it a strength rather than a weakness.} 11. Be3 b5 12. f4 b4 13. Nd5 Nxd5 14. exd5 f6 15. fxe5 fxe5 {The isolated pawn is not ideal, although white now has a doubled pawn as well.} 16. c3 a5 17. Rae1 O-O-O 18. c4 Rhf8 19. Bd2 Bd6 20. a3 b3 {I push to block in the B pawn, but blundered away my A pawn by mistake.} 21. Bxa5 Kb7 22. Bc3 Ka6 23. Bxe5 {I overlooked the double attack on the E pawn.} Rxf1+ {Hoping to deflect the rook and win the bishop.} 24. Kxf1 {But no go.} Rf8+ 25. Kg1 Re8 {The double attack on the bishop seemed nice.} 26. Bc3 {but was easily countered.} Rxe1+ {I exchange in hopes of attacking the B pawn.} 27. Bxe1 Be5 28. Bf2 Kb6 {Careful to defend before attacking.} 29. d4 {A temporary sacrifice for the B pawn.} cxd4 30. Kf1 Kc5 31. Ke2 {The C pawn is hopeless.} Kxc4 32. g4 Kxd5 {The D pawn falls as well.} 33. Kd3 c5 34. Kd2 Ke4 {Moving my king ahead of my pawn seemed necessary to advance the pawns.} 35. Bh4 {White's bishop seems to be eyeing D8 where it would appear to have the best chance of getting into a helping position for the A pawn advance.} c4 36. a4 d3 37. a5 Bxb2 38. a6 Bd4 39. Be1 {But the bishop never takes that route.} Kd5 {With my pawns and bishop secure, I backtrack the king to eliminate the threat of the A pawn.} 40. Kc1 Kc6 41. Kb1 Kb6 42. Kc1 Kxa6 43. Kb1 Kb5 44. Kc1 Ka4 45. Kb1 Ka3 {I had 1:44 left on the clock when white ran out of time.    (This was the second blitz game we played, in which the first I embarrassingly blundered my queen away in the opening and promptly resigned. I believe this misfortune lowered White's guard going into this game. Thanks for watching my game.)}
