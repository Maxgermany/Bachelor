1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 { I was trying to figure out how to annotate a game, how to save the images, and decided to try one.  Using the keyboard arrow keys moves the pieces on the board.  Wow, just make a comment for a move, click "save, and this is all done automatically!  Photos are automatically saved for any position that you add comments for at the bottom.  This is quite a quality feature.  The annotation didn't show up for awhile, then appeared.} 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. c3 h6 7. Bc4 Nd7 8. Nf3 Nb6 9. Bb3 e6 10. Ne5 {Morphyous58 is beginning an attack already.  I considered Ne7 but didn't want to hem in my bishop.} Bh7 11. O-O Bd6 12. Qg4 Bxe5 13. dxe5 g5 {Supposedly protecting g7, and freeing my bishop.} 14. h4 {Morphyous58 keeps up his attack.  I see that taking the pawn will lose the rook, and plan to move Bg6.} gxh4 {I forgot my analysis while waiting for my turn to move, and took the pawn anyway, a major blunder that loses the game.  I am going to take more time for my moves from now on, and write the best lines where there is not a clear choice.} 15. Qg7 Kd7 {There is no good move.  I resign.}
