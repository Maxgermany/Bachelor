[Opening "Sicilian (B23), closed, Korchnoi variation"]

1. e4 {My opponent opens with what I consider to be the strongest opening move.  The King's Pawn avoids many of the slower manoeuvrings of other openings, allowing White to concentrate on fast attacking play.} c5 {I respond with the Sicilian.  It creates an unbalanced board, allowing Black to attempt to call some of the shots early on in the game.} 2. Nc3 {White preserves the option of an open or closed Sicilian.  Black must now be cautious.} e6 3. Nf3 a6 {Black is looking to counter Whiteâ€™s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5.} 4. a3 {I think 4.g3 was the better move here, not really sure what the aim of White's was.  I suspect it was a passive move, waiting to see what Black's intentions were.  But I think this move tosses away the advantage White has by virtue of the colour of his pieces.} d5 {Black responds with d5,  showing a real willingness to contest over the central squares.} 5. exd5 exd5 {Pawn exchange.  White is in danger of losing control of the match.} 6. d3 Nc6 7. h3 Nf6 8. Be2 Be7 9. O-O O-O {Both players castle.  White is slightly cramped in his positioning.} 10. d4 Ne4 {Black threatens White's Knight, beginning to take the initiative away from White and assuming control of the match.} 11. Nxe4 {White offers an exchange of Knights, which Black eagerly accepts.} dxe4 12. d5 {!!! Oh dear.  White was evidently thinking of an exchange of Knights again, but overlooked the fact that the initiative was with Black allowing for 12...exf3 13.Bxf3 Nd4 which gives Black a +2 material advantage.} exf3 13. Bxf3 Nd4 14. Be4 f5 {Black threatens White's Bishop.} 15. Bf3 f4 16. c4 Bf5 {Black wins after White's timeout.}
