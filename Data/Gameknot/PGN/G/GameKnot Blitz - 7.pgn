[White "bareq (???)"]

[Opening "Mieses opening (A00)"]

1. d3 {So, my opponent opens with d3.} e5 {My response is e5, which I often use. !Very! often :D} 2. Na3 {Bareq plays Na3, which seemed me a bit strange, because if I had taken his knight with my bishop, he would have doubled pawns on the edge of the board.} Nf6 {But I didn't take it, I played Nf6 instead. I chose this option because I don't like closed games, so bishops can be useful later.} 3. e3 {e3 followed. It didn't seem that my opponent wanted to use his bishops.} d5 {But I wanted, so I opened the way of my LSB, and also set a pawn into the centre.} 4. Nf3 {Bareq plays Nf3, atacking my e5 pawn.} Bg4 {I didn't allow to capture it, I pinned it to his  queen.} 5. h3 {But now if I don't want to lose a pawn, I have to take his knight.} Bxf3 {Ok, done.} 6. Qxf3 {My opponent plays Qxf3, taking my bishop.} c6 {Then I played c6, and my future plant was to bring my knight from b8 to d7. And look at the white piece on a3. It cannot go to the centre. I think my opponent's next move was to move it closer to the center, so} 7. c3 {he played c3 attacking d4, and also freeing some place for his knight (the c2 square) to go, and later to approach the centre.} Bd6 {A simple developing move defending my e5 pawn and preparing a short castling.} 8. Nc2 {Why does he want to take his king with his knight???:D} O-O {My king is on a safe square, and I think I am OK with developing.} 9. g4 {Hm... Seems my opponent wants to attack my kingside...} Re8 {Never mind :D} 10. g5 {Whoah! He comes closer and closer.} e4 {Again, never mind :D} 11. dxe4 {A pawn exchange. My rook and queen are on the middle files, his king is on the starting position, but with these exchanges he can be in a bad situation.} Nxe4 {And I saved my knight and also attacked White's g5 pawn with my queen and with my knight.} 12. h4 {So he protects it and continue coming to my kingside.} Nd7 {I intended playing this. I managed to play this :)} 13. Nd4 {What??? His knight is in the centre??? :D} Ne5 {Then I have 2 knights in the centre:D If added to each other, 3 knights in the centre :D And I attacked his queen! Hahaaa!:D} 14. Qh5 {He moves it out of danger, putting more pressure on my kingside.} Qa5 {But I'm brave enough to play this! I was thinking about Nxc3, then if bxc3, Qxc3+ follows forcing white king to move, or I can take his rook and after force him to move his king :D} 15. f4 {Uhhh! Those pawns don't seem to come because they are friends of mine... Especially with the queen...} Ng3 {But I had this move! It forces White to move his queen on d1 or to exchange it for a pawn, which would be strange to meet with.} 16. Qd1 {As I thought. I can take his rook, and he acn take my knight. OK, let's see.} Nxh1 {A heavy piece disappeared from h1, that could have made big problems with the queen if he hadn't had his pawn on h4.} 17. fxe5 {+2 points of advantage here :D} Bxe5 {One more point! :D} 18. b4 {I expected this move because I also saw that my queen can cause some problems there.} Qc7 {Aaand: my bishop and queen is on the same open b8-h2 diagonal, and my bishop can move to g3 easily :-)} 19. Qf3 {A small error in my plan: My knight is attacked.} Ng3 {But I notices it! And he didn't see any chances to win. He also had little time. He resigned here.
