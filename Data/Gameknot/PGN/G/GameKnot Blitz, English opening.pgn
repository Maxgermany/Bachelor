1. c4 {English opening, my current system} c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. g3 e5 5. e4 b6 6. d3 {Pretty standard, although I should have my fianchetto bishop in place sooner. I'm eyeballing that d5 square for my knight} Bb7 7. Bg5 Nf6 8. Bxf6 {Went for the trade so the knight is off the d5 square. That square is mine!} Qxf6 9. Nd5 {Got it :)} Qd8 10. Bg2 Ne7 11. O-O Nxd5 {My knight was intolerable for black, so he went for the trade. Good move.} 12. cxd5 Be7 13. Qd2 O-O 14. Ne1 {This is where my middle game went a little soft. I wanted to swing my knight to the queen side for some reason.} Qd7 15. h4 f5 16. Nc2 {Taking would be bad here. I will not mess up my pawn structure, so the pawn can push all he wants} f4 17. Na3 {Still, not gonna split my pawns} fxg3 18. fxg3 Ba6 19. Nc4 {The knight will dominate play on this side of the board for many moves. Maybe it's good I brought it over} b5 20. Na5 c4 {Thought about taking, but his white diagonal is too strong. Will let him take separate those pawns} 21. Nc6 Bd8 22. b3 Bb6+ 23. Kh2 {A little nervous here. The queen and rook could do damage on my king side} cxd3 24. Qxd3 Rac8 25. a4 {Here I'm hoping he takes with the pawn. It would reveal my queen and allow me to take his unprotected white bishop} Bd4 26. Ra2 {Staying on the a-file and looking after my bishop} Qb7 27. axb5 {I spent at least 2 minutes on this move. Figured it to work out to equal exchange at the very least. I considered pushing the pawn up as well, but I thought I might need that square as a post for the knight at some point. I'm sure with more time and calculation a better move could be made, but an even exchange seemed ok} Bxb5 28. Rxa7 Bxd3 29. Rxf8+ {Necessary to trade rooks too. Otherwise I lose the exchange} Rxf8 30. Rxb7 {And there we are, equal exchange. He definitely has positional advantage with the bishop pair breathing down my king's neck. Also, with the board opening up, bishop pairs are dominate over knights.} Rf2 {Wasn't scared of this at the time. Should have been though} 31. Rd7 Bxe4 {This is why...} 32. Rxd6 {I did not feel the need to panic though. I do not see mate for my king and the bishop is lost, accept it.} Rxg2+ 33. Kh3 Bf2 {Now this is a problem. I got checks of my own though} 34. Rd8+ Kf7 35. Nxe5+ Kf6 36. Ng4+ {Alright. I definitely want to trade cause those black pawns are key} Kg6 37. Rd6+ Kh5 38. Nxf2 Rxf2 39. b4 {Feeling good about the end game. I don't think he has mate anywhere } Bf5+ {Uhhgg, I'm in trouble} 40. g4+ Bxg4+ 41. Kg3 Rf3+ 42. Kg2 Kxh4 {So much for protecting those pawns} 43. Rc6 {Idea here is to get my pawn off the white square and moving up. } Rh3 44. d6 Bf3+ {Excellent fork. I just walked my self right into it. It's these type of mistakes that I rarely commit when playing normal time. Got to learn to keep focus under time pressure.} 45. Kf2 Bxc6 {}
