[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 {good morning (7 am when i annotated this :D). This is an irregular annotation for me as i have been playing black about 3:1 versus playing as white. i like a classic e4 opening being more a maverick player with the nimzowitcsh defense as black.} e5 {my oponent replies with e5.   this was the strongest opponent i was facing after an 8 month stop, and my rating had dropped to its floor.} 2. Bc4 {i like my tried and true opening that works well for me. i like an early exit of the white bishop and doing king side attacks. im a fan of playing f4 and doing early castles if allowed} Nf6 3. d3 {sometimes i like to play d3 here but being one of my first games back i was also rusty. i find that playing nc3 more effective when black replies with nf6 on move 2.  holding the d pawn back also if your oponent makes a mistake in his opening can allow for a d4 instead and an instant opening of the board and aggressive frontal assault} a6 {anticipated reply once i block my bishop out sometimes. i think d5 is a stronger move for black players here. hence why my d3 is a mistake and why i prefer nc3.} 4. a3 {i want to keep my white bishop on this diagonal its always nice to have it bearing down on the f pawn} Nc6 {hmm was expecting b5 here but i guess that was too plain and this was supposed to be a higher rated opponent i was facing. i guess i dont have to retreat my bishop. } 5. c3 { in hindsight i shouldve maybe played f4 here, but in the games i dont play nc3 i eventually send my knight to d2 so i thought c3 would prevent his knight from coming down and wouldnt stunt any of my long term king side attack plans} d5 {d5! the importance of nc3 show itself! i decide to swap out pawns since im planning to castle soon and have 2 lanes open} 6. exd5 Na5 {hmmmmmm unanticipated reply....  this fight has just been taken to me.  . i looked at the board i had nothing developped and my oponent was about to start coming in. hiding my bishop in a2 seemed way too passive.  he could end up with 2 knights on my queen side and my weak pawn line. or he can come out with his with LSB to attack my queen and maybe double pawn or weaken my king side pawns. he can bring out his DSB to c5 for some pressure with a fork possibility in future on f2.   my game is looking weak on move 6} 7. Qe2 {told myself ill keep the fight centered, let him capture the bishop with his knight and my d5 pawn will be covered with dxc4.  i also believe my opponent didnt anticipate this reply because he moved how i thought he would for the next 3 moves} Nxc4 8. dxc4 Bd6 9. f4 O-O 10. fxe5 Re8 11. Nf3 {i had looked about this far into the game, 5 ish moves ahead and was thinking this looked better than playing a2 on move 6.  my future plans was to  king side castle bring my DSB to f4 bring my other knight to d2 and on with the king side attack. it seems my opponent had different plans for me} Bg4 {i didnt like this move and i think i shouldnt of tried to kick the bishop here. i shouldve castled and it wouldve released tension i think.  } 12. h3 Bxe5 {hence why trying to kick the bishop wasnt good. Bf4 wouldve also probably been better to a castling. and way better than h3  this opponent was making me think here why did he leave his LSB hanging.     if i take the LSB, DSB goes bg3+ then my queen is dead.   damn almost died here.       im so used to being the aggressor as white this is uncharted territory for me playing on the defense.  and if i castle the same thing happens with Bh2+} 13. Kd1 {considering all this i decide to forgo my castlings and relieve some tension. could i have replied better?} Nxd5 {hmm knight sacrifice with a LSB hanging my opponent is coming at me hard.   this one i will take though} 14. cxd5 {undoubles my pawns i can block the immediate queen retake with my knight and reinforce my other knight im liking this road!} Qxd5+ 15. Nbd2 {done and done} Rad8 {hmmm this is looking VERY dangerous to me. i looked at  hxg4 and almost fell for it again!  just before i took his LSB i took a moment to make sure his queen couldnt do much. i was looking at   hxg4 followed by his Qxd2  replied by nxd2 and Rxd2 Qxd2  this wasnt possible so it felt safe to take his LSB.  but relooking at his queen was Very essential.    The assault wasnt coming from the front.    if i go hxg4 he replies  Qb3+ leads to  Ke1    then Bg3+ kf1 blocking in my rook. then its Rxe2   Very bad state of game  man oh man i have only 1 possible reply i think after analysing it for a while i thought this was my best move and thought it to be epic.  } 16. c4 {the essence of chess.  a single pawn moving a single square changing a BIG deal on an entire board. leaving his queen and LSB hanging.  i was proud of myself but i couldnt celebrate too soon this wasnt over.   Damn my opponents had many tricks and traps up his sleeves.  i could now see my Rook in the A file was hanging and my b Pawn because of the blind attack from the rook on my queen. and i saw 0 replies.  the thing i had in my favor was his 2 hanging pieces to maybe help me gain time.} Bxf3 {no time gain there forced to swap out.  i looked into recaputuring with my queen but but then he can take the c4 pawn with his queen and my knight would still be pinned.  if i take his queen with my pawn he takes  my queen with his LSB has a blind check with my hanging rook in the corner} 17. gxf3 Qc6 {relieves stress on his queen, i couldnt see what to play here i was pretty crunched having a pin my rooks were asleep.  oh crap his queen antics are still alive on Qa4+ ke1  Bxb2  then my queen dies to a rook.  i think only reply left} 18. a4 {was there anything better than this white players?  i attribute my entire game to 3 moves  Qe2 on 7  c4 on 16, and a4 now  and i told myself well im tired of all these pins and playing his game. hes simplified enough i feel confident in 2 rooks 1 knight 1 bishop vs his Queen and 1 rook.  when he comes in for Bxb2 hes going to be shocked!} Bxb2 {oh really you want my queen well you can have her!} 19. Qxe8+ {CHARGE@!} Rxe8 20. Bxb2 {hmmm i wonder if he thought it would simplify to this ><   was that considered a real or sham queen sacrifice?  now my goal is to connect my rooks ASAP!} Rd8 {he pins my king but that wont bother me long} 21. Kc2 {alright this wont be easy. but i didnt like queen rook alive for him ill look to simplify out his rook} Qg6+ {the dance of the end begins i like that i have 0 hanging pawns at the moment even though they are all broken off} 22. Ne4 Qg2+ 23. Kb3 Qxf3+ 24. Nc3 {alright i cornered my king lost a pawn but i feel safer to move out some pieces now} a5 25. Rad1 Rxd1 {hmm he gave me the simplification i was looking for} 26. Rxd1 h5 {i dont understand why he didnt take my h pawn he will regret it later. he turns out to be the hero!} 27. h4 {might as well gain time and unpin my knight if he wants to take that pawn, } c6 {i dont like the pressure thats coming my king is running out of move space,   i can predict his f pawn will be the one he tries to race over} 28. Ba3 {lets get this bishop into play } f5 {theres that racing pawn} 29. Rd8+ {lets get my rook behing his pawns while gaining time} Kh7 30. Rd7 {and i decide to pin his king so that g pawn cant reinforce his f Pawn and im also attacking the b7 pawn} Kg8 {hmm he decides to unpin. i guess he wants to see what im trying to do. i guess we are both sorta waiting to see what the other will do lol.  i decide to relieve stress on my king} 31. Rxb7 Qg4 32. Be7 {i wanted to protect my remaining pieces. and since his f pawn is passed i love these types of anchors for my bishops.} f4 {hmmm Crunch time. at this stage of the game it was final draw.    i took me a Long time to analyse many courses on how to get that damn pawn and i couldnt see a way without it costing me a piece for a pawn  while his queen would still be alive. i did not like that trade off.   im pretty sure he felt confident he could race it there too.  i was stuck for atleast a day then when i stopped thinking about it. it came to me. if i look back when i sacrificed my queen it was cause i felt confident i could face him 2rooks 1 knight 1 bishop vs 1 rook 1 queen.  Where had that confidence gone    look for the checkmate Trix!  and i see it! look at that nice resting spot on g5 for my knight and then Rb8# it was so simple.  will my oponent see it coming or will he keep racing his pawn down } 33. Ne4 {He also gave me a blind spot to get my knight there, i felt confident if he started to make my king dance i could still get there} Qd1+ {here comes the dancing. im pretty sure my opponent doesnt know what im going for still or he wouldnt of done the next 3 moves} 34. Kc3 Qe1+ 35. Kd4 {have to protect the knight, cant believe hes giving me the time to get my king closer to his king to help solidify a checkmate.   i think he still thivks im looking for a way to eat his pawn} Qe3+ {one more little boost in the right direction} 36. Ke5 Qe1 {he left his pawn hanging maybe the cat was out of the bag now. but i felt not taking the pawn and using it as a view blocker from his queen to be wiser} 37. Kf5 f3 {hes still racing down i guess he thought i would swap out knight for the pawn. out of my 3 pieces} 38. Ng5 {*shreaking cat noise*  "The Cat is RRRRRRRRRight out of the bag", my opponent didnt see this brazen move coming 'til almost the last second! can he do something about it.   The pressure of going after the racing pawn has shifted to preventing a Checkmate} Qg3 {hmmm blocks the immediate Rb8#   cant obviously got to rc7 either.    what about rd7 hmmm  no! Qg4+ then he lops of the rook. retreating the rook down doesnt look wise.} 39. Ra7 {boom a hanging pawn and the threat of the checkmate still alive} Qb8 40. Bc5 {now what friend! i even can take out the racing pawn now. hes going to have to find some nasty tricks} Qf8+ {hmmm un anticipated reply.   if i move king he kills my bishop. if i eat with my bishop it looks like hes going to get his queen off. but then  i look at board i dont really understand his move here or unless he feels i will blunder.  i analysed that if he takes the Bishop with his king i can prevent him from queening. and if he goes for a queen straight its back to the same state of game less a pawn for him} 41. Bxf8 f2 {and then i saw even better} 42. Rxg7+ {wow i was very proud of myself this had been one of the toughest games i had been in with a huge back and forth.      All comments appreciated.} Kxf8 43. Rf7+ {obviously either way he moves i move my king in the same direction and lop of that pawn  All comments appreciated.  my opponent resigned at this stage hope you all enjoyed the game.  this turned out to be one of my most memorable defensive games so far and i give alot of respect to my opponent in this one he had me thinking alot}
