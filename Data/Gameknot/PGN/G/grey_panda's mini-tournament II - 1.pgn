1. e4 {The Undeserved.  Not sure how I got away with this one against an opponent I struggle with.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {We'll go with my usual opening (I tried summat different in the next match and it worked. Badly.)} Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. a4 {Probably a bit weak, too nervous of this opponent.} O-O 6. b4 Be7 7. Ba3 Nxe4 8. Bd5 d6 {After cursing myself for leaving a pawn hanging I got lucky here. I couldn't see any trap so a free knight is a free knight.} 9. Bxe4 d5 10. Bc2 e4 11. Nd4 Ne5 {Neither side overly well developed. Looking at b3 for the bishop but the whole queen side rather congested.... guess which side I'm hoping to tuck the king away on.} 12. O-O {Hey I never said I could play this game.} f5 13. d3 Bg5 14. dxe4 dxe4 15. Bb3+ Kh8 16. Be6 Qd6 {I had hoped for BxB, KxB, but he isn't falling for that one.} 17. b5 {So I go for a nasty little exposed instead. Pure fortune it was there, but I've found I can set those up and pretty much leave those grenades around.} Qd8 18. Bxf8 Qxf8 19. f4 {Hoping that my opponent isn't familiar with en passant.} exf3 e.p. {Poo.} 20. Bxc8 Rxc8 21. Ne6 {Now that I thought at the time was a great move, but it gets me into trouble.} Be3+ 22. Kh1 {Forces me into a corner and then I'm getting worried about g2.} Qf6 23. Nd4 {Offering the sacrifice. Expecting R-d8.} fxg2+ {Now that opens up the King defences, but I felt it was premature., With the knight guarding f3 I felt he could have taken a tempo to move the queen into position or pin the knight to the queen with the rook.} 24. Kxg2 Qg5+ 25. Kh1 f4 26. Nf3 {Now from this point I felt for most of the rest of the match as if I was one move from disaster.} Nxf3 27. Qxf3 b6 28. Na3 Rd8 29. Rad1 Re8 30. Nc4 Qc5 31. Nxe3 fxe3 {That I hadn't thought through properly either.} 32. Rde1 h6 33. Qc6 {Willing to accept the doubled pawns to relieve the pressure.} Qe5 34. Rf7 {Yeah. Well.} e2 35. Rxc7 {Now greed overcoming my innate good sense.} Rf8 {And getting my just deserts.} 36. Rxg7 {If I'd played Q-g2 the rook would have gone anyway. And since this move prevented the immediate R-f1 (I thought) it meant I got a lowly pawn in exchange.} Rf1+ {That confused the heck out of me.} 37. Rg1 Qf4 38. Qe8+ {But seeing an opportunity I decide to avoid the whole mess.....} Kh7 39. Qg8# {And I'm sure I got called a few names for that one.}
