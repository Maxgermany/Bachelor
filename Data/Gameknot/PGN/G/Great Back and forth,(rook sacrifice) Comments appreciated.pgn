1. e4 {e4 classic!} c5 {and so the sicilian. i dont know if i followed all the proper lines to call it that but id like to know where i couldve replied better in some circumstances,} 2. Bc4 {my opponent goes with the bishops opening,} Nc6 {i decide to develop my knight over possibly playing e6 or d6 and i didnt want to invite an e5 with a move like nf6} 3. a3 {hmm passive reply? i had no intention of going nb4 anytime soon but i am planning to push queen side and i liked this move,} Nf6 {last game i played with c5 start. i did a post game analysis and it judge my mistake to be when i played g6 on move 5 or 6 to try to get a square for my DSB on g7. and so i told myself i ill avoid that situation for as long as possible and look to move my bishop out through e6 and then Be7} 4. Nc3 {more development + pressure on d5 and covering e4} a6 {and here i thought i could get a jump on my queen side pawn push as i thought he would play nf3 next and i could then kick his LSB with b5 and after his LSB move play e6, also prevented his knight or LSB from going to b5.  is e6 first preferable or is my line of thought logical?} 5. Nf3 {anticipated} b5 {kick!} 6. Ba2 {anticipated. i thought he would remain on that diagonal after having opened a3, i guess he anticpated these 2 pawn moves when he played a3 on move 3.} Bb7 {and so before playing e6 i thought i could activate my LSB. is this ok? i thought he would either castle or try some sort of attack with his knight on g5. which i would consider a loss of time, or maybe finally play d3} 7. Ng5 {he opted with the option i prefered.} e6 {and so i finally Have to play e6 now } 8. d3 {he gets in his d3 before he castles} Be7 {and my development is nearly complete all is left is to castle} 9. Nf3 {hmm retreats the knight and i dont even have to play a move like h6.} O-O {and so i castle} 10. O-O {castle reply!  the board is set, i didnt play the g6 mistake like last game. ive got some nice high pawns queen side. but im in uncharted territory and to be frank. i have 0 clue where to start my attack from here, lol.} Nd4 {mistake?  my thought is i didnt think he would trade out knights. i liked having my knight on a high outpost to start my assault.  but i think this move starts a fire that gets out of my control and costs me alot of material. and puts me in a fight where i got to climb out of a deep hole the rest of the game. but i get to put out this fire with 1 last stomp of a move in the end!} 11. Be3 {alright creates extra pressure to gain a pawn in the exchange} Qb6 {and so i thought this was a safe square for my queen behind the pawns, connecting my rooks and protecting the exchanges,} 12. Bxd4 {hmm un anticipated choice. i assumed he would prefer to keep bishop pair over his knight,} cxd4 13. Ne2 {double pressure on D pawn, this fire is starting to pick up,} b4 {and so i decide to let him be a pawn up but atleast this move prevents b4 and my DSB cannot be condemned for a long time. also creates opurtunty to start opening the A file for my A pawn, } 14. axb4 {hmm i thought he was going to open his b file over opening the A file. i really loved this capture over knight first} Qxb4 15. Bb3 {hmm opening up his rooks file. and preventing my queen from taking the b pawn. judicious choice over taking my d4 pawn immediately with one of his knights.} Bc5 {and so i try to reinforce the d pawn, i think this was a mistake completely overlooking his A rook. specially since 3 moves ago i had told myself ill accept a pawn down situation. and shouldve looked for a better avenue with that train of thought in mind.} 16. Ra4 {well its back down a pawn but now he has a dangerous rook into action} Qb6 {retreat. thought this to be my best post for her} 17. Nexd4 {and he finally gets his pawn. the wind just picked up and that fire is taking a semblance of life,} e5 {and so i decide to try to kick the knight back to the passive e2 square. my lack of experience with this opening is showing.  i have a nicely developped game yet i feel like im constantly playing the wrong piece,} 18. Nf5 {bah it just got crowded king side.this is potentially very dangerous but i see some nice possible antics now on the f2 square} Ng4 {and so i thought this move would create alot of pressure } 19. Qd2 {he defends with queen appropriately} g6 {g6! and so i decide to attack his knight. with no real intention to take it as i dont want to open the view over my king but to kick the knight away. was g6 a mistake like last game even though it came 13 moves later? i thought it could possibly serve as good anti knight material in a future where queens are off board. and since his DSB is off board that diagonal is safe, } 20. Ng3 {retreats} Bc6 {i decide to try to gain time with this move and its future coverage of the A file to promote my A pawn up the file.} 21. Ra2 {decides to retreat his rook to a2. hmm thought this to be curious, maybe hes leaving an option to stack his rooks. or just want to protect his b pawn from my eventual DSB, this brought my attention to the b pawn. and i have to get him off the board to make it best possible options for my A pawn,} Rfe8 {and so i decide to cover my e pawn without blocking my DSB's path. i dont want his knight to come down here} 22. h3 Nf6 {kicks my knight back home} 23. Qg5 {ouch! this really creates alot of tension. 2 knights queen all over my king! with a hanging knight} Bb7 {i felt protecting with my queen was better than bringing my rook up to e6} 24. Nxe5 {he gets to grab a second pawn cause of my hanging knight! this is getting really scary, i told myself i have to get his LSB off board to relieve tension} d5 {and so i reply this to induce exchanges and with the skewer on his rook it would force the LSB exchange} 25. exd5 {and he accepts my play} Rad8 {but being down 3 material now i thought that exchanging now wouldnt be wise. i thought i could activate my second rook and still be able to get his d pawn and look to use my bishop pair advantage effectively to help climb my A pawn} 26. d6 {ouch! man -3 and finding myself in this position. i guess i wasnt playing the proper moves at all and the score was showing it. i didnt like this situation } Rxe5 {i judged the knight was the most effective piece in that attack combined with that d pawn,  also in my current skill level and gameplay experience. my Bishop play is far better than my rook play is. so i decide to give him 1 of my rooks. keep conserving my bishop pair and also get that scary d pawn out of here. } 27. Qxe5 Rxd6 {and so i find there to be alot Less stress around my king now but im at a -4 score, sheesh.  but im looking at this wide open board and my bishop pair. maybe momentum will be on my side cause of his sleeping rooks} 28. Raa1 {hmm he tries to activate his rook.} Bd4 {time to finally shine and get some sharp bishop play into this ugly tangle i got myself in early on} 29. Qe2 {love it! put that knight on f3 to sleep!zzzzZZZzzz} Bxb2 {lets climb out of this damned -4 hole and now the a pawn is extremely dangerous.} 30. Rab1 {decides to attack my bishop} Qd4 {reinforce with queen since his knight has no access to e2 at the moment} 31. Qe7 {this looked scary. but after simplfying out the material i did its easily defendable} Rd7 {if he takes with bishop on f its Kg7 and he has a hanging LSB for a pawn, not a great exchange as he would be forced to retreat or lose his queen, and all surrounding pieces are protected from his queen to attack them,} 32. Qe2 {nice not offering the queen exchange yet and putting his knight back to sleep when up 3! i cant make any mistakes with these time gains} Bc3 {tactical play here. pin all pawns. shut alot of doors. and protect my A pawns climb} 33. Bc4 {hmm waste of time? my LSB is safe. and so is my pawn in this state or on the next square.} a5 {the pressure race is on with each time gain i can get} 34. Rb3 {i guess here hes looking for ways to impede my pawn more than trying to attack my bishop, but my bishop pair will help my chisel and kick that rook a few turns to help my pawn climb 2 more squares} a4 {and so i can keep climbing} 35. Ra3 Bc6 {protect the pawn!} 36. Kh1 {hmm more time gain! was he looking to possibly play his f pawn? or he didnt like his king being on black squares.} Bb2 {kick!} 37. Ra2 a3 {Anchor! now that rook is gone for the rest of the game. i dont see how he can get it out of there and i find my DSB remains active on a good diagonal, my plan was to somehow get my LSB to eye his Rook or get my Rook to a1 somehow} 38. Qd2 {finally wakes his knight up. } Bd5 {i told myself i can maybe accept the LSB trade off at this stage and it would place my queen on d5 eyeing his rook,} 39. Ne2 {seems my opponent didnt feel compelled to trade bishops first and attacks my queen first. this created a bother but then i saw a nice move that would let me keep my LSB and get his off the board} Ne4 {alright i accept queen trades! but ill fork your rook and lose my knight to your LSB buddy!} 40. Qe3 {hmm no knight take? well...} Qxe3 {onwards with the same plan!} 41. fxe3 Nd2 {fork!} 42. Rf4 {i guess this protects the c pawn for a bit, but hes starting to pin his rooks down} Nxc4 43. dxc4 Be6 {and from this stage of game. either of his rooks cant really move. i thought he would come with nd4 and that looks scary to my LSB} 44. Nd4 {and he did!} Bxc4 {but it creates a nice wall for my LSB and a "blind" escape route. now im also eyeing his Rook} 45. Nb3 {-2. looking brighter and brighter. here though this creates alot of problems on the a1 square!} Rd1+ {ill still kick his king to a dark square. and have possible future play with my DSB} 46. Kh2 Be6 {and i protect my LSB your move buddy!} 47. Kg3 {wow hmm this i really liked. and saw another way to get another pawn and set up a deadly attack on his king} Bxb3 {time for surprises!} 48. cxb3 Rd3 {2 hanging pawns. also protects my A pawn in the future if i want to move my DSB} 49. b4 {decides to try to race his passed pawn} Rxe3+ {gain time attack} 50. Rf3 Re2 {not the first rank but instead i set up my favorite deadly attack. i couldn't go to the first rank as his pawn would get there before mine in the time it would take to swap out his A rook. and so i thought my opponent calculated this and would see my move here with the rook as a huge time gain and would keep racing his pawn down,} 51. b5 {and he did so much relief ! from -5 to +4 over the entire game!} Be5+ {ouch.! my favorite attack which has won me many games. checks with the DSB that discover other material!  my opponent offered his resignation at this stage. i would appreciate comments in the instances where i couldve replied better, especially early on. as late game is often alot more theoritical sometimes}
