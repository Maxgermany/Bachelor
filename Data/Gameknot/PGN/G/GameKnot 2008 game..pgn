1. e4 e5 {Standard King's Pawn Opening.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 Nxd4 6. Qxd4 d6 7. O-O Be6 8. Be3 Qf6 9. Bxe6 {If Black takes White's Queen, White stands to win a pawn.} fxe6 {Black chooses to avoid an immediate pawn loss - so White elects to continue development.} 10. Nc3 a6 {The Black "a" pawn was not really in any immediate danger.} 11. e5 {Probably not the best.} dxe5 {Black gains a pawn but now has doubled isolated King pawns.} 12. Qa4+ c6 {For the price of a pawn White has encouraged Black to compromise his pawn structure and moves to interfere with the Black ability to castle} 13. Rad1 Be7 14. Qb3 {Attacks both the e6 (which is currently protected) and the b7 pawn.  I am actually trying to set something up but it requires a few moves.} b5 15. Rfe1 a5 16. Ne4 Qg6 {Not the square I wanted his Queen on.} 17. Bb6 a4 18. Qf3 Qf5 {Black offers an exchange of Queens which would undouble his pawns but unfortunely for Black his Queen is now in position for my combo.} 19. Nd6+ {Those unexpected checks - they ruin the best laid plans and interfere with one's good intentions.} Bxd6 20. Qxc6+ {A forking check! So much for Black's Queen Rook.} Kf8 21. Qxa8+ {Perhaps he did not believe I would take the Rook.  Black resigned to this check and just as well since his d6 Bishop has a rather limited life expectancy.  Perhaps the time to chase the White queen would have been after Black had safely castled.}
