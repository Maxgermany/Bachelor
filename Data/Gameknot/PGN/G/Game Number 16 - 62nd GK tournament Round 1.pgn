[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {My opponent begins with the Queen's Pawn, which is slower for castling than the more popular King's Pawn.} Nf6 {My standard response is Nf6, with the hope of a King's Indian.  I play against Queen's Pawn openings quite regularly, one of the great players in Costa Coffee specialises in it enjoying the slow tactical manoeuvring that he can achieve.} 2. Bf4 {Perhaps trying for the London System?  I've always felt Nf3 first is the better move.  I suppose it is to stop my Knight on f6 from threatening the Bishop since after e3 I'd lose the Knight via Qxh5.  I could just be rambling here, I'm not all that familiar with anyone playing Bf4 before 2.Nf3.} e6 {I'm looking at playing Bd6 as soon as I can place it in a defend able position to challenge the f4 Bishop.} 3. e3 b6 {Looking at attacking the weaker Kingside with a fianchetto.} 4. Nd2 {Was expecting c3 here.} Bb7 {Pins White's g2 Pawn and begins my threats on the White Kingside.} 5. h3 {Offers an escape the the White Bishop in case I play Nd5?  Not what I had in mind however, I'm still looking at the eventual Bd6 to shift that Bishop.} d5 {Now my Pawns are developed into the centre, I can play Bd6 without blocking my development.} 6. Ngf3 {Possibly just developing for the Kingside castle?} Bd6 {The killer attack on the White f4 Bishop, planned from the beginning.  This move is why I dislike the London System, White now struggles to find decent play.} 7. Ne5 {Now the Ngf3 becomes more obvious, allowing White to defend his f4 Bishop.  However, this closes off the Bishop quite nicely, so other than being aware of the problem of Nxf7 I am happy to ignore it.} O-O 8. Bd3 {Looking at castling on the Kingside.} c5 {I'm attempting to destabilise his Pawn structure.} 9. c3 {Finally.} Nc6 10. Qf3 {Open to castling on either the Kingside or the Queenside.  However, I think this move was slightly worse than just simply castling to the Kingside.} Qc7 {Still threatening to dislodge the f4 Bishop, integral to the London System.} 11. Ng4 {Provoked White into pinning my Bishop, which will allow me to dislodge it soon.  I'd have considered 11.Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.O-O, which I think was slightly better.} Ne8 12. dxc5 {Not the best of choices, disrupts White's Pawn formation whilst keeping mine reasonably strong.  I think White should've looked at 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.Qg3 Qxg3 14.fxg3 instead.} bxc5 13. Bxd6 Qxd6 14. O-O {I preferred 14.Qe2 here, but I don't think there's much difference.} f5 {Shifting the White Knight away and strengthening my grip on e4.} 15. Nh2 {White moves the Knight out of immediate danger.} Ne5 {Fork on White's Bishop and Queen, forcing the Queen to move.  I considered e5 instead, and am curious on the opinions of you, the readers, whether or not I made the right choice.  Perhaps 15...e5 16.Qg3 Qe7 17.Rfe1 Rb8 ??} 16. Qe2 Rb8 {Once again, I'm not sure I made the right choice here either.  Considered exchanging the Knight and Bishop with 16...Nxd3 17.Qxd3 Ba6 18.c4 dxc4 19.Qc3 Nf6 20.Nxc4.  Be interested to hear any thoughts on the matter.} 17. Rfe1 Nc7 {Just shifting the Knight to a more powerful square than the edge of the board.} 18. c4 {18.b3 better?} Rfd8 19. Nb3 {Definitely should've considered 19.f4 instead, with half an eye on possible threats to the White Bishop.} Ba6 20. Nf3 {Poor choice of moves, and now my lead is well and truly established.  I think the best option for White was 20.Rad1 Nxd3 21.Qxd3 Bxc4 22.Qc3 Bxb3 23.axb3, yes it loses a Pawn but I think it was the best option available.  After 20.Nf3, we're looking at 20...dxc4 21.Bxc4 Bxc4 22.Qc2 Nxf3+ 23.gxf3 Bxb3 24.axb3 which loses a Knight and a Pawn.} dxc4 {Bishop and Knight fork.} 21. Nxe5 {Prefer Bxc4, but there's not much in it.} cxd3 {Bishop and Knight exchange.} 22. Nxd3 Bxd3 {White's net loss is a Knight and is forced to retreat with the Queen.} 23. Qh5 {I think this was panic, White had misjudged the exchange and now found his Queen under threat so moved her to a safe attacking position.  However, after 23...c4 is gives up the b2 Pawn without a fight.  I prefer Qd2.} c4 24. Nd4 Rxb2 {As expected, White gains the b2 Pawn free of charge.} 25. Nf3 {Should've perhaps considered a4?  Not really much in it I guess.} Rf8 26. Ng5 {Threatens a cheeky mate!  White is hoping Black is so interested in his own attack that he misses this.} h6 {Black does not miss it :o)} 27. h4 {Seems to be a theme copied from one of my previous tournament games, weakens the King's defence for no real reason.  I think the best bet was to shift the Knight back to f3.} hxg5 28. hxg5 {Black wins another Knight, going to +6.  White is hoping for g6 followed by Qh7#, but there it's easily defended against allowing Black to gain an even larger lead.} Nd5 29. Rad1 {Gives up on the a2 Pawn, no real choice left in all honesty. } Rxa2 {Another free Pawn, thank you :o)} 30. e4 {Trying to regain some lost material.  Perhaps Qh3 instead?  To help shore up the King's defences?} Qb6 {Pins White's Pawn at f2 and takes control of the open file.} 31. Re3 {First real blunder I think, hangs his Rook out to dry.  At the time and in analysis, I can't see a mate (although I'm sure there is one, probably around 20 moves), but I was certain I had won the game here.} fxe4 32. g6 {Best moves I can see here for White is 32.Rg3 Raxf2 33.Kh2 Be2.  Not a winning move, more a 'delay the inevitable' move.} Rfxf2 {And now I can see a mate, or at least I did in analysis.  33.Qh7+ Kf8 34.Qh8+ Ke7 35.Qh4+ Nf6 36.Qh8 Qxe3 37.Kh1 Qg3 38.Qxg7+ Kd8 39.Qh8+ Kd7 40.Qh2 Qxh2+ 41.Kxh2 Rxg2+ 42.Kh3 Rh2+ 43.Kg3 Nh5+ 44.Kg4 Rag2#.  During the game, I was simply thinking that after  33.Qh7+ Kf8 34.Qh8+ Ke7 35.Qh4+ Nf6, I should be able to find a mate.} 33. Qh7+ Kf8 34. Qh8+ Ke7 35. Qxg7+ {Instead, White shows me a mate.  35...Kd6 36.Qh8 Qxe3 37.Qb8+ Kc6 38.Qa8+ Kc7 39.Qxa7+ Rxa7 40.Rd2 Rf5+ 41.Rf2 Qxf2+ 42.Kh1 Rh5#} Kd6 {And White resigns.  So remember, if White is keeping you in perpetual check, don't panic, keep calm and analyse where the likely checks will be coming from.  If you have a note of what it likely to happen, you can stay calm and end in a winning position.  Thank you yellowlab, for a fun game.}
