1. d4 {Hi all! Here is a mini-tournament game in which I won with a neat queen trap! In this mini-tournament, all the games were preset to start off with the Gruenfeld Defence.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 {The Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to grab a big pawn centre, which he will then try to undermine. The sharp Classical Exchange Variation runs 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, and White has a massive pawn centre, but Black will place intense pressure on this pawn centre with 6...Bg7 7...c5 8...Nc6. However, if White can hold on to his pawn centre, he can expect an edge in the middlegame.} 4. c5 {? A weak move. Firstly, this takes off all White's pressure on the centre, and, secondly, Black can undermine White's overextended pawn-structure with 4...b6, which is what I will do!} b6 5. Qa4+ {5.b4 a5! 6.a3? bxa4 and White's a-pawn is pinned, so this continuation is clearly losing for White. When I used to mess around with 3.c5 or 4.c5 for White in queen pawn openings, I soon realised this, so I used to try to complicate things and throw a spanner in Black's works with Qa5+. Clearly my opponent was thinking along the same lines. For an example of extremely active queenside play in an annotated game - my first ever! when I used this strategy as White, try here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lrr-rules.pl?gm=18725} Bd7 {Blocking and developing with tempo as the queen must do something about this threat.} 6. Qb3 bxc5 7. Nxd5 cxd4 8. Qb7 {An apparently powerful move, trying to pick up material on Black's queenside. However, despite White's seemingly strong continuations, I believe that Black can still gain a superior position. I am planning to play ...c5 and ...e5, grabbing a huge share of the centre and exploiting White's lost d- and c-pawns - products of his poor 4th move.} Bc6 {The only move that saves material, and this is a strong move since it forces White to react to Black's counter-threat.} 9. Nxc7+ {(?) Loses material as 9...Kd7 leaves two of White's pieces (Q and N) under attack.} Kd7 {Obviously 10.Nxa8?? Bxb7 and Black will gain queen and knight for rook.} 10. Qb3 {Fleeing, and targeting the pawn on f7. Can this compensate for the knight? Even if it was a free pawn, it wouldn't, and this pawn will certainly give Black indigestion...} Qxc7 11. Qxf7 {??} Bd5 {Ta-raa!!!!!!! Her majesty is trapped within a wall of Black's irritating minor pieces. This is truly a beautiful queen trap. I must include this in my "Favourite Games" portfolio.} 12. Qxd5+ Nxd5 {White has no resistance left. He is down by a queen for a pawn, and massively behind on development - not that that matters when you're a queen behind! If it's OK with everyone, I'm not going to comment any further on this game, since Black has so clearly won in this position :-).} 13. e3 dxe3 14. Bxe3 Nxe3 15. fxe3 Qa5+ 16. Kf2 Qd2+ 17. Be2 Qxb2 18. Nh3 Nc6 19. Rhd1+ Kc7 20. Nf4 Qe5 21. Nd5+ Kc8 22. Bg4+ e6 23. Nf4 Qb2+ 24. Kg3 Qe5 25. Bxe6+ Kc7 26. Rd7+ Kb6 27. Rb1+ Bb4 28. Rd5 Qxe3+ 29. Kg4 Rhf8 30. g3 Rxf4+ 31. gxf4 Qxe6+ 32. f5 Qxd5 33. fxg6 Qe4+ 34. Kh5 Qxg6+ 35. Kh4 Qxb1 36. a4 Be7+ 37. Kh3 Qd3+ 38. Kg4 Rg8+ 39. Kf4 Qf1+ 40. Ke4 Rg4+ 41. Ke3 Qh3+ 42. Kf2 Rg2+ 43. Kf1 Qf3+ 44. Ke1 Qe2# {White struggled like a shoal of fish in a net. But I filleted his king...eventually :-). Thanks for looking at this game!}
