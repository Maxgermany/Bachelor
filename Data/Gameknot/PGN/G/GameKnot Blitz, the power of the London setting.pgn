1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. h3 {Dubious, but necessary to bring a place for the dsb in case of Nh5.} Bf5 4. g4 Bg6 {Good diag for the black lsb, but...} 5. Bf4 e6 6. Nbd2 Bd6 {Normal...} 7. Ne5 {normal. The good one. } Bxe5 {Bad exchange for black, but he is already playing at my will. } 8. dxe5 Ne4 9. h4 {Necessary to avoid Qh4 tricks. } Nxd2 10. Qxd2 {Still good for white. } h6 {Needed, to save the bishop. } 11. h5 {To make h6 weaker. } Bh7 12. g5 {Black must be astonished. What am I doing, throwing my pawns before castling and even free the lsb?} Nc6 {Foresees to take advantage of e5 after the exchanges to come. } 13. gxh6 gxh6 14. Bxh6 {Without fear: if Nxe5, Bg7, Nc5 (only one to save a piece), and maybe I still have an attack (Qxe4...)} Rg8 15. f4 {Delicate moment. Black can have counterplay with that column. } Qd7 16. Bg5 {Preventing him to castle, and blocking the column. Moreover: freeing the h pawn.} Be4 17. Rh2 {A key square for my rook, as you will see. } Ne7 {Blocking the dsb action so to castle. } 18. h6 {I could have played Qb4 instead. But this threat is also good. } O-O-O 19. Bf6 {Guarantees a BxR exchange, at some point. } Bh7 {Better was d4, probably. This blocks the pawn, of course, so it's not bad. } 20. Qb4 Nc6 21. Qa4 Rde8 {How to proceed? } 22. O-O-O {Anyway, e3 is on the "to do list". } a6 {Rg1 could have been good. } 23. e3 Nb8 {Good, he must defend. } 24. Qb4 { No point in exchanging queens. I'm not sure this is the best square for it. } Qc6 {Now you can see the power of the Rh2.} 25. Bd3 {Anyway, I must go on with the h pawn's threat. } Bxd3 26. Rxd3 Rg1+ {Probably, the best is Rd1, but I wanted to risk.} 27. Kd2 Reg8 {Uh oh. Anyway...} 28. h7 {Risking all. } Rg8g2+ 29. Rxg2 Rxg2+ 30. Ke1 {The key. Now, I threat Qf8+ AND h8=Q+... Black can pursue me with Rg1+, Rf2, Qxc2+, KxR, but black doesn't have a perpetual due to the rook, the queen etc. } Qxc2 {The losing one. But what else?} 31. h8=Q+ {He resigned here: Kd7, Qd8+, Kc6, Rc3+ wins the queen and the game. }
