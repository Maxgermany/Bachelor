1. e4 {i'm looking for a good reponse at e4 playing black, and i still didnt found a good one which suits me well, so while waiting  play my prefered "modern defense" when i have a hight elo's challenger} g6 {modern 1} 2. d4 Bg7 {modern 2n and that could be all theory, one of the reason i like this defense : secure, agressive and simple.} 3. Bc4 c6 {normaly i play c5, but i didnt this time, who knows why, but it was good, preventing 5. qf3 e6 6. d5! ...etc.} 4. Qf3 {my 1811's elo oponent whant to finish quickly with his 1219 beginer challenger...it will be served as !} e6 {so where was the treath ?...} 5. Ne2 {now his knight is doing a inacurate move in ordr to castle ...} d5 {...meanwhile i regain the initiative ! and center will be mine.} 6. exd5 cxd5 {center mine ! } 7. Bb5+ {poor move, no tactic, no plan. I will take the opportunity to develop my pieces} Bd7 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. c3 Nge7 10. O-O O-O {so here is the "middle game" (i suppose, tell me if i'm wrong) : So how like is the both positions ? blacks better or white better ? I think is more or less the same in both camps, but i'm already very proud to have been resisting honorably until there !} 11. Bg5 {this was sure. so i dont whant to stay in a defensive black game. I like initiative, surprise and agressivity. Let's take some risk then (even with good oponent) !! I play f3 ! And then g5. Force is on the king side.} f6 {first } 12. Bh4 g5 {second !} 13. Bg3 {things get complicated. I have to advance my king to renforce the paw wall, and this mean a lot of risk. anyway we can not turn back, i have to assume.} Nf5 {this was not the better move. after Bxf5 e6xf5 the queen will taked5+ destroying my center.} 14. Bxf5 exf5 15. h4 g4 16. Qd3 {happy surprise, he missed d5 weak pawn ! this is blitz lucky situation.} h5 {blunder, the risk was Kf4} 17. Nf4 {so now i'm in bas situation.  i loose d5 or f5...witch one whould you choose ?} Be8 18. Ne6 {better ! i did not saw this, so now i'm loosing. But i have a very little chance treathening b2 with the queen. Let's try it} Qb6 19. Nxf8 {of course he take it and nothing wrong happens to him...i'm dying} Bxf8 {white queen will eat f5, bad time for black.} 20. Qxf5 Bg7 {i have to defend at least f6 but i'll loose d5} 21. Qxd5+ {now i have my chance, white is too greedy : now he cannot defend b2 and will loose his knight} Bf7 {First ...} 22. Qf5 {second ...} Qxb2 {third ! i win the knight} 23. Nd2 Qxd2 {that's a good job !} 24. Bf4 {inacurate move} Qxc3 25. d5 {another inacurate move, he panics ! } Nd4 {in order to fork the king and the white LSB} 26. Qd7 {first ... (another inacurate move)} Ne2+ {sedond ! i win the bishop} 27. Kh1 Nxf4 {he he  he !} 28. Qxb7 {ho, what a compensation ! but i havea terrible plan : Bxd5!} Bxd5 {treathening a fork with LSB x g2} 29. Rfc1 {good answer, but no enought !} Bxg2+ 30. Qxg2 Qxc1+ {good calcul  for blacks } 31. Rxc1 Nxg2 32. Kxg2 {and now, please tell who's the boss ?? :) but the game is not already done ...} Kh7 {preventing Rc5} 33. Rc7 {pining the DSB} a5 {let's promote some queen} 34. Kg3 {king fight's coming} Kg6 35. f3 f5 {protect } 36. Rc6+ Bf6 37. fxg4 fxg4 38. Kf4 {end is coming : Rb8 ...Rb4+ must help !} Rb8 39. Ra6 Rb4+ 40. Kg3 a4 {he he he one more step !} 41. a3 {ho, terrible treath ! so i will win the paw and defend mine with Rb3} Rb3+ {and then it was enought for oponent. }
