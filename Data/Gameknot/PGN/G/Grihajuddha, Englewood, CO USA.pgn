[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A46)"]

1. d4 {Sudatta usually prefers to open with the king's pawn. This is the 6th time she is starting with d4 against me. } Nf6 {Being an Indian I like playing Indian defences :) } 2. Nf3 d5 3. Bg5 {The Torre attack (Tartakower variation). Here is a note from Wikipedia as its introduction: White pursues quick and harmonious development, will bolster his d4-pawn by c2-c3, then often enforces e2-e4 to obtain attacking chances on the kingside as the Torre Bishop pins the f6-knight. If White plays an early c4, the opening will transpose to a number of more common queen pawn openings, such as the Queen's Gambit or one of the various Indian defences. The opening is named after the Mexican grandmaster Carlos Torre Repetto, who beat former World Champion Emanuel Lasker with it. The variation was also employed by Savielly Tartakower, Boris Spassky, and Tigran Petrosian early in his career. Among top-level players it perhaps has been most utilized by Jan Timman, Alexey Dreev, and Pentala Harikrishna. The Torre Attack is rarely met in modern top-flight play as a "Go to or Primary" system, and statistics suggest that it is not particularly advantageous for White. Due to its calm nature and relative lack of theory, however, it is popular at club level, giving White chances to seize a middlegame initiative. In recent years it has also been used against Black's kingside fianchetto pawn structure. } e6 {Alternative variation: 3... Ne4 4. Bf4 c5 [leads to Trompovsky attack (A45) type position, with the difference that  now White doesn't have f3 to harrash and dislodge the knight from e4, which is now already protected by the d5 pawn.] } 4. e3 Be7 5. Bb5+ {Deviation to a sideline. chessbase live database shows only 6 games played in this line since 1994 to 2010 } c6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. O-O Nbd7 8. Nc3 {Blocks the c-pawn's scope. This knight is better placed at d2 Alternative variation: 8. Re1 Ne8 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. e4 Qb4 11. b3 Qb6 12. exd5 cxd5 13. c3 Nef6 14. c4 Qc7 15. Qc2 Qd6 [and so on, as in Geibel,H-Reimann,W/Bad Zwischenahn 2003/CBM 097 ext] } c5 9. Bb5 {I still haven't got White's intention in this move! } a6 {Gains another tempo on this bishop. } 10. Be2 {Alternative variation: 10. Bxd7 Bxd7 [was better than this] } cxd4 {Couldn't resist the chance to get a half-open c-file in my Sicilian like set-up Alternative variation: 10... c4 11. a3 b5 [is probably better for Black.] } 11. exd4 b5 12. Qd2 Bb7 13. Bxf6 {Why exchange the bishop for a knight now? Alternative variation: [Better was] 13. Rfe1 } Bxf6 {Alternative variation: [May be]  13... Nxf6 [was slightly better. But I didn't like] 14. Ne5 [and White pieces are gaining some and activity better placement.] } 14. Rfe1 Re8 {Preparing for a future e4 break and getting behind the pawn which is half open to White. } 15. Bd3 Rc8 {Grabbing control of the c-file. Alternative variation: [Now I think I could have played] 15... e5 [right away.] 16. dxe5 ([or] 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 17. dxe5 Bxe5) 16... Nxe5 17. Qf4 Qd6 } 16. Rad1 Qc7 17. Bf1 {No apparent reason to un-develop this bishop. } e5 {Here it comes, two moves latter. } 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 19. dxe5 Bxe5 {Now White overlooks the chance to immediately remove the weak and isolated queen's pawn, instead plays } 20. Re2 {Alternative variation: 20. Nxd5 Bxd5 21. Qxd5 Bxh2+ 22. Kh1 Be5 23. c3 [was still manageable] } Bxh2+ 21. Kh1 Be5 {Alternative variation: [Better was]  21... Rxe2 22. Qxe2 Qd6 $19 } 22. g3 {Looses immediately. } d4+ {Discovered check and attacking the c3 knight } 23. Kg1 {Alternative variation: 23. Nd5 Bxd5+ 24. Bg2 Bc4 Alternative variation: 23. Ne4 f5 24. Bg2 fxe4 } dxc3 24. bxc3 Bf3 {I settled for a rook Alternative variation: [Here I thought of] 24... Qc6 [but somehow I didn't see anything clear.] 25. f3 Qxf3 26. Bg2 [I saw this far (nothing surprising).] [But now I see] 26... Qxg3 27. Qd3 Qh2+ 28. Kf1 (28. Kf2 Qxg2+ 29. Ke3 Bd6+ 30. Kd2 Bf4+ 31. Qe3 Bxe3+ 32. Ke1 (32. Kd3 Qg6#) 32... Qg1#) } 25. Re3 Bxd1 26.
