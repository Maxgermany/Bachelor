1. e4 {Hi everyone!  After the disappointment of missing out on my first ever Master Draw I did receive some consolation in a white flag from a fellow 1700 player in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament.  It all started as a standard Sicilian Defence but unlike many Sicilians that I have played in on gameknot I reverted to exchanging on c6, something I used to do in my OTB tourneys with mixed results.  Here it worked out OK and you are about to see something unusual in my games - Glenda going on the rampage!} c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {4. Nxd4 - all sooo standard.} Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. e5 {7. e5 - a line recommended in the db.  The game is about to get a little wild!} Nd5 8. Ne4 Qa5+ 9. c3 f5 10. exf6 e.p. {10. exf6 e.p - getting rid of my advanced e pawn and now one pair of knights is exchanged.} Nxf6 11. Nxf6+ gxf6 12. Be2 {12. Be2 - development.} Ba6 13. O-O Bxe2 14. Qxe2 {14. Qxe2 - now the lsbs are swapped off and Glenda stirs.} e5 {14. ........ e5 - after that little wild skirmish it seems like a quiet looking position.  Suddenly ...........} 15. Qh5+ {15. Qh5  - ................ Glenda moves out of her comfort zone of my first two ranks and glares at the black king.  Check!} Ke7 16. Qf5 d5 17. Bg5 {17. Bg5 - Fou Lenoir now joins Glenda in the act and like Bonnie & Clyde this double act end up stealing a couple of pawns.  Note that Fou Lenoir cannot be taken because this will allow Qxe5  picking up the black rook on h8.} Bg7 18. Qxe5+ {18. Qxe5  - the e5 pawn is a free pawn because the f6 pawn is pinned to the enemy king by Fou Lenoir.} Kd7 19. Bxf6 Bxf6 20. Qxf6 {20. Qxf6 - the dsbs are now exchanged but another black pawn drops off.  Glenda ain't finished yet.} Raf8 21. Qg7+ Kd6 22. Qg3+ Kd7 23. Rfe1 {23. Rfe1 - after extricating Glenda out of the enemy camp I now decide to control the e file.  Glenda is pursued by the black rooks but she manages a couple of useful checks.} Rhg8 24. Qh3+ Kd8 25. Qh4+ Kc8 26. Re7 {26. Re7 - bone in the throat, though I must keep an eye on my back rank, that can be a favourite haunting ground for Old Matey.} Qd8 {26.  ........ Qd8 - the Wicked Witch of the West comes back to defend the back rank.  Another black pawn is about to drop off, and as it turns out so do the queens, yippee!} 27. Rxh7 Qxh4 28. Rxh4 Kb7 29. Rh7+ Kb6 30. Re1 {30. Re1 - time for my other rook to come to e1.  Black brings his rook to e8 and I decide to move my rook on h7 to e7.  An exchange of rooks now follows.} Rfe8 31. Rhe7 Rxe7 32. Rxe7 a6 33. Re3 {33. Re3 - bit worried though about the possibility of pawn exchanges on d4 leaving black with a passer and some worrying counterplay.  Thankfully this does not quite materialise.} Kb5 34. b3 {34. b3 - to stop the black king in his tracks for as long as possible.} a5 35. h4 {34. h4 - passed pawns must be pushed.  Next move I put my rook on d3 hoping to avoid the exchange of pawns in my note of move 33.} c5 36. Rd3 Rh8 37. Rxd5 Rxh4 {37. .......... Rxd5 - my lovely passer on h4 has gone but thankfully there is no possibility of that exchange on d5 and I retain my 3 pawn advantage which will prove decisive in this endgame.  Now before I think of pushing my remaining passers I start Operation Joblock with 38. f3.} 38. f3 Rh6 39. g4 {39. g4 - let's start again!} Kc6 40. c4 {40. c4 - my rook is en prise, I decide to protect with my c4 pawn - Stage 2 of Operation Joblock!} Re6 {40. ....... Re6 - the black rook tries to penetrate by controlling the e file, but Henry locks him out with 41. Kf2!} 41. Kf2 Re8 {41. ......... Re8 - trying to penetrate via the h file is he?  Well, let's stitch up the queenside - I have time to do this and I play 42. a4.  Stage 3 of Operation Joblock.} 42. a4 Rb8 43. Rd3 {43. Rd3 - Here is Stage 4, the final stage of Operation Joblock.  Now the black rook cannot take the b3 pawn without sacrificing himself, the black king cannot penetrate via b5 as the square is guarded by the white a and c pawns and the black king cannot come around the side because my rook on the d file is the Berlin Wall!  Now Henry's job is to shepherd his kingside infantrymen towards Glendadom.  On move 44 I push my pawn to g5 for the start of this plan.  Black sees he cannot stop this and waves the white flag.  I am second in the table and have 6 points out of 7 games and achieved my highest rating to date - 1775.} Rb7 44. g5 {}
