[Opening "English opening (A16)"]

1. c4 {Start off with my standard English Opening.  Karpov describes the English as best for when you wish to "avoid long theoretical variations and rely more on 'understanding'", which is why I have a strong preference for it when playing OTB games.  I haven't been playing long enough to have a great repertoire of openings, so I chose the English as my game to ensure I could be competitive without having to spend alot of time studying many variations.} Nf6 {This move is full of possibilities, but the one I think is most popular is 2.d4 which transposes into the Indian Defence.} 2. Nc3 {As a true advocate of the English lines, I instead stick with them.  2.Nc3 doubles my attack on the d5 square, beginning my normal strategy of central control from the wings with an eventual fianchetto on the cards.} e5 {Probably considered the main line response. } 3. g3 {Normally I would go with 3.Nf3, forcing Black to look at the e5 Pawn.  3.g3 isn't a line that I play or am experience in at all, but since I'm using Gameknot as a place for me to practice my chess and experiment I felt it was a good idea to test the line.  The idea was to begin my fianchetto earlier than normal, strengthening my centre.  Having finished the game I think I'll probably stick with 3.Nf3 from now on :o)} Bb4 {I like exchanging Knights for Bishops, so this move wasn't something that worried me.  I guess it's all about personal preference, and I feel that my Bishops are much more useful during a game so am normally more than happy to exchange.  I could force Black to decide whether or not he REALLY wants to exchange with 4.a3, but I prefer to continue with my normal development.} 4. Nf3 {Lots of choices.  I could put the question to Black with 4.a3, or I could fianchetto my light-Bishop with 4.Bg2 or develop my Knight.  I had expected Black to hesitate over the Bishop-Knight exchange so figured it didn't really matter which order I played Nf3 and Bg2, so sent my Knight out first.  It adds a little pressure on the central e5-Pawn so I hoped to force Black to defend that in some way before being able to continue with his plans.} Bxc3 {I'm sure I'm not the only person surprised by this move.  It forces me to deal with the Bishop rather than immediately continue my development (or take the e5-Pawn which is currently only defended by the offending Bishop), gives me doubled Pawns on my Queen-side and thus slightly weakens my Pawn structure.  But it seems a bit of a waste on behalf of Black, who now will inevitably lose his Bishop.  I think I'd have advanced the central Pawn to e4 which forces White to waste a move by moving the Knight a second time and denies the e4 square to White.} 5. dxc3 {OK, so I double up my Pawns.  However, the d-file is looking nice and open for my Queen and Black must still make a move to keep the e5 Pawn safe.} d6 6. Bg2 {Finally get my light-Bishop into the fianchetto.  Looks fairly even right now.} O-O {I think a development move would have been better, perhaps Nc6.} 7. Be3 Nc6 8. h3 {I'm not sure where this got away from me, but I don't like the position I'm finding myself in.  I think it's still fairly even, but I dislike weakening my King-side after Black successfully weakened my Queen-side earlier.  Starting to believe that my best bet is to go on a major offensive, send my Pawns into attacking positions and keep my opponent on the back foot, reacting instead of being able to make a move by choice.} Bf5 {I prefer 8...Be6 9.Qa4 Ne7 10.O-O Nf5 11.Bg5 h6.} 9. Nd2 Qd7 10. g4 {I begin to implement my new policy of attack.  Black's Bishop can only move to one of two squares, either g6 or e6. No good is 10...Be4 11.Nxe4 Nxe4 12.Bxe4.} Bg6 {Best of the two options I think.  I feel that Be6 would've cramped Black's position, which is what White is obviously aiming at by the advance of the Pawns.  Whereas Bg6 continues to block White's long castle.} 11. b4 h6 {Black gives his Bishop an escape route.} 12. O-O {Still looks pretty even to me, I wouldn't have minded either colour at this point.} Rfe8 13. Qa4 e4 14. Rfd1 a6 15. Qb3 Qc8 16. a4 Ne5 17. a5 Bh7 18. c5 d5 19. Nf1 c6 20. Bf4 {Starting to slightly swing in White's favour.  I probably should've written something about the previous 8 moves, but they all seem fairly obvious to me. This is an aggressive move, trying to force something to happen and gain a measurable advantage.} Ng6 {Allows White to move his darkside-Bishop to the attacking d6 square.  I think Black's best move was Nc4, a more attacking move and keeps the Bishop from occupying d6.} 21. Bd6 Nh4 {Black attempts to distract by further threatening my weakened defences.} 22. Bh1 Nxg4 23. hxg4 Qxg4+ {Not overly sure I like this tactic.  Black gives up his Knight for two Pawns and a strong attack on the White King.  However, it did have the desired affect.  I panicked.} 24. Ng3 {?!  And as everyone knows, panic during a chess game is never good.  At the time of the move I was thinking that Ng3 was better than Bg3 because my darkside-Bishop was in a nice position.  In hindsight, I think I threw away my hard-earned slight advantage here, after 24...e3 25.c4 Rad8 26.cxd5 Qh3 27.Ra3 exf2+ 28.Kxf2 Qh2+ 29.Kf1 we'd have been about even but with the momentum swinging in Black's direction.  Note: no good was 24.Bg2 after 24...Qxg2#} Nf5 {I think 24...e3 was better} 25. c4 e3 26. cxd5 exf2+ {Promote threat on f2, so I have very little choice.  Beginning to look like I may pay the price for having weakened my King-side Pawn structure.} 27. Kxf2 Nxg3 {??  The first blunder of the match I think.  27...Re3 28.Qxe3 Nxe3 29.Kxe3 was much better, forcing White to concede his Queen to stay in the game.} 28. Qxg3 {Offering the exchange of Queens, but Black knows he can't afford the exchange already being down in material.} Qxe2+ {The better move, gives Black a 3-0 Pawn majority on the Kingside.  But it's not going to make a difference if White keeps cool.} 29. Kg1 cxd5 {I preferred 29...Re3 first, then 30.Qg2 cxd5 31.Qxe2 Rxe2} 30. Bxd5 {Pins Black's Pawns at b7 and f7, White begins to show why he was happy to exchange Bishop for Knight earlier on.} Qe3+ {???  I almost want to add a fourth ? there.  Black lost the game here, it was heading downhill already but careful play from 30...Be4 might've allowed him to force a draw.} 31. Qxe3 {White is more than happy to go with the exchange offered.} Rxe3 32. Bxb7 {Forces Black to move his Rook and gains a nice Pawn majority on the Queenside.} Rae8 33. Bxa6 {Now White has equalled Black's Pawn majority but on the Queenside.  White's Pawns are much further advanced and so much more of a threat to Black than Black's Pawns are to White.} Re8e6 {Think I preferred Be4, but I doubt it makes a difference now.  It's over for Black, assuming White doesn't make any more errors!} 34. Bc4 Rg6+ 35. Kf2 Re8 36. Rde1 Rf6+ 37. Kg3 Be4 {Black admits defeat.  Checking the Tournament table, I require a draw in my final match to ensure progression so tune in to see how it turns out! :o)}
