[Opening "Caro-Kann (B13), exchange variation"]

1. e4 {E4 is my opponent's choice, the perfect chance to try out what I've been practicing. My opponent was rated 2363 when we played. Most Grandmasters no longer play the Caro-Kann, because it is deemed as rather dry and drawish - that is, black in most lines gets easy development and good draw chances. However, although sharp positions can arise, the Caro-kann is not considered as 'fighting' as the Sicilian; in my games I've found this to be true - but if my opponent makes a mistake, after the Caro-Kann opening and into the middle game, black usually has a very good pawn structure and can take advantage of said mistake very easily. Stay tuned! ;)} c6 {I respond with c6, the characteristic Caro-Kann 2nd move.} 2. d4 {D4 by my opponent. All this is theory.} d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 {This is a lesser played line, favored by Anatoly Karpov at times. Taking with the queen in this position IS a safe 'uninspiring' response, but it does something important: preserves the pawn structure black wishes to keep.} 4. Nc3 {And the usual response is to chase the queen away, with tempo. Some don't like taking with the queen because of that tempo, but the loss of tempo here is not as much of an issue as it could be in the middle game or in a sharper opening.} Qd8 {And again, this is the safest place for the queen right now. I don't favor Qa5, eventually having to move the queen a second time when tactics and strategic concerns are becoming a greater issue. Better to just move it back.} 5. Bc4 {A typically aggressive place to position the Bishop, although the d3 square for that bishop is considered in many lines to be better... nevertheless, Fritz says this is the strongest move. F7 is often the weak point in the Caro-Kann, and black must be aware of attacks against that point if choosing to play this system.} Bf5 {Now, in some lines, Bg4 is much better. Black actually would like his knight on f5 in many lines of the Caro-Kann, but getting the bishop to g4 requires some preparation. Had white tried Qf3, e6 would have followed. All kinds of things white can steer these lines into, but black simply follows a few ideas and can be okay.} 6. Nf3 {Development. I could have chosen to move Nf6 first, followed by Bg4; but I was wary of that light-squared bishop, and needed my own bishop out so as to play e6 quickly.} e6 {So before the rook comes to e1, I position the pawn on e6, which is a thematic place for it in the Caro-Kann. } 7. O-O Be7 {This is a good place for the bishop; it prevents tactics involving discovered check in a few moves, protects against further piece aggression on the kingside. Now, often in the Caro-Kann, white castles queenside and throws those kingside pawns at black. He still can do that, but if his attack fails, his king will be vulnerable. EDITED: he can still throw his kingside pawns at me even having castled kingside was my intented meaning here; sorry for the vagueness of  my comment!} 8. Qe2 {Getting ready to hit the e6 pawn. Ne5 was more accurate, however! It will take a few moves for white to be ready, and my king will not remain there long enough. So I continue developing. The purpose of the Caro-Kann is to, in most lines, develop fully before trying to make inroads against the space advantage white WILL have. It is a lot like a French defense, and in some lines very similar; but of course there is not the problem of the bishop... or at least, not to that extent. So far, most of the play has not been the more dangerous lines for black. So far! if you want to see a dangerous line for black, watch that 2nd Anand/Carlsen game, up to the QxQ move, and imagine instead Vishy going for Qg4. Unpleasant!} Nd7 {This is a very important move in the Caro-Kann. it is to prevent a white knight from remaining at the e5 outpost where it can greatly pressure f7 as white mounts an attack.} 9. Ne4 Ngf6 {And now my development is almost complete. Notice that white has a space advantage, his pieces are fairly coordinated, but there is not yet great pressure on black's king. } 10. Nfg5 {This is the first inaccurate move. Not a blunder, but it really does little for white's attack here, despite the scary look of the board! ;)} O-O {Am I castling into it? Fritz says the game is now equalized.} 11. c3 {Shoring up the white pawn structure... and, I believe, sitting there trying to provoke h6. My opponent here is making a high percentage of very good moves. } Nxe4 {Well, let's see which piece he takes with...} 12. Nxe4 {I thought as much. This guy, remember, is rated over 2350. One of the strongest players I've ever played. But I am not experimenting this game; yes, I am trying out some of what I've been studying, but focusing in this one; trying my best to win. Fritz says the game is equal here, but white has a tiny edge still.} Nf6 {Now white has made a few inaccuracies; take note of them: ideally, he'd like a knight on e5, and should be advancing the h pawn, and often other kingside pawns. Perhaps he is not as familiar with the theory; as a result, so far my defense is solid. Notice that although I don't like my light-squared bishop where it is at, I haven't repositioned it yet because I haven't needed to yet. All my pieces are where they need to be except that one, but where it needs to be I am not certain of yet. Oh! And the queen of course. C7 is a typical spot for the queen in the Caro-Kann, but at this point I have a plan and don't feel like moving the queen twice...} 13. f3 {This made me pause a moment. White has just loosened up the king safety, but for what advantage? I can't tell if he plans on trying g4 here; but if so, he'd have been better to have his king on the queenside. This move is not really an inaccuracy by my opponent, but in this position this plan seems slow, if it's to support g4. Now Fritz wants me to counter with b5 and Nd5, but I want to move my bishop first. I don't want white getting his pawns rolling with tempo, if that is his intent.} Bg6 {I retreat it. I still can advance my own h pawn to hide the bishop, but I don't want to have to be solely passive... and it's not time yet to trade for that knight. Note that if black in the Caro-kann trades his light-squared bishop for a knight, then black should blockade on the white squares, and play on the dark squares. THIS is important, in the Caro-kann. Also note that if I do move g6, I will likely be inviting a piece (bishop) sacrifice on h6, and could find myself on the defensive - and passive - for a while.} 14. Bf4 {White controls the C7 spot, but I'm not going to need it anyways. I could contest the square, but I don't want to trade bishops. Otherwise, not sure where white is going here; he may be thinking of putting his bishop on e5. Simply amazing to see how many first picks my opponent is moving here! He's good. Many of mine aren't first picks, but they're all based on Caro-Kann principles, and so far they haven't let me down.} Nxe4 {I decide to take the knight after all. Fritz does not like this at all, giving .4 more to white's score. This gives white a better pawn center with a (imho more dangerous) half open file, so this move was probably not the best one by me. But I did it because I am still back on my heels, and I need to: 1. Reduce the pressure a bit and 2. Create a little opportunity for activity. I most especially did NOT want that knight getting to c5, and it's a potential defender of what I wish to do next... while my knight would be too far away to help!} 15. fxe4 b5 {In the Caro-Kann, if white allows black to get developed, and allows black a smidgeon of initiative, hitting back on the queenside with b5 is a good way to get counter play. Fritz wanted me to do this a couple of moves ago, but I wasn't ready. My opponent probably expected this. A c5 pawn break in some positions is even better for black.} 16. Bb3 {Bb3, again the best response. Sheesh. This guy must have an engine in his head! Look at the position; white is still dominating the board. But this is a tiny crack, and I try to make use of it.} a5 {And now I am pushing back.} 17. Rae1 {Amazingly, white dismisses my queenside pawn push, and positions for his own attack. Well and good, as perhaps he thinks to win my dark-squared bishop. But Fritz says my opponent has just made his second inaccurate move; Rad1 was better. Perhaps he thought I would play c5, which is also one of the thematic moves in the Caro-Kann, and perhaps his plan was d5 in response, beginning his king assault. I am mindful of that, hence I have not gone for the c5 break to this point, move 17. Note that my c pawn is backwards, but there is no simple way for white to take advantage of that, and it's often necessary to live with that when creating counterplay on the queenside - at least for a bit.} a4 18. Bc2 {This is probably the best square for white's light squared bishop, but it potentially allows me the chance, at an opportune time, to get my own inactive (up to this point despite the great diagonal) bishop off the board.} b4 {Now this could disrupt the e1 rook, if cxb4 with white not wishing to trade dark-squared bishops. Or perhaps he doesn't want to have to move the black bishop if I were to retake the pawn exchange with my bishop threatening his rook on e1. Or so it seems, that he just wants his rook to remain where it is, even though Fritz still says it belongs on d1.} 19. h3 {Instead, white creates a place to put his king... if so I am not impressed by this prophylactic move, as right now I think it is not necessary. Plus, it allows me to reposition for my queenside push, before white's attack gets rolling. A miscue by my opponent and Fritz dislikes it too.} Qb6 {White does not like my queen ex-raying his king, and decides to do something about that. Here I missed a3, which ought to win something akin to a pawn or come close to it: 19...a3 20. Bb3 c5 21. d5 axb2 22. Qxb2 exd5 23. Bxd5 Bf6 and the c pawn falls, to name one possibility, with a very good position for black.} 20. Kh1 {This move will come back to haunt white. But, where else could he go? I have counter play now, and although I am still cramped, this is all this opening is supposed to get me. Not as fighting as the Sicilian, but it's VERY simple to learn, and as we recently saw, still in the top grandmaster's repertoire. And yes, I need simple!} b3 {This shouldn't go anywhere really; but, because white wishes to keep his bishop on the b1-h7 diagonal, it does. Because white chooses b1 rather than d3.} 21. Bb1 {What would you do here as white? Axb3 was slightly better. What would you do here as black?} a3 {...a3! There is no overwhelming advantage to be had; but now, every white continuation is favorable to black. I am giving white problems up there. Potentially able to double rooks on the a file, with a pawn going that way, my pieces all pointing that way, now white realizes he has to give some consideration to what I've been doing up there!} 22. Rf2 {So he doubles on the 2nd rank, and is also positioning to double on the f file! However, I find a great in-between move in this Blitz game that Fritz does not even consider:} Bh4 {Bh4! Fritz thinks this is a mistake. But! Every white continuation is still negative; and white is forced to move his g pawn or lose material. Most important of all... this move further weakens his king...} 23. g3 {Back to where I was. Did I lose a tempo? Yes, but I judged the compensation worth it. White must still deal with the queenside, and his king safety as I mentioned  is much looser.} Be7 24. Qc4 {White probably would not have done this if he had more time to consider. Fritz doesn't like this move either. But then again, he is a strong player; he's choosing double-edged positions. His d5 push could come... but not much will yet come of it because of the position. So he has yet to push that d pawn, and here we are on our 24th move. The evaluation favors black now by nearly a pawn!} bxa2 {At this key point of the game, I make the best choice. The top four Fritz choices are -.83, -1.70, -11.47 and -12.02 How should white recapture?} 25. Bxa2 {He chooses the bishop. Not the best choice, the queen as the better choice because it allows what happens now.} axb2 26. Rb1 {Finally, my opponent is the one who blunders. Black is solidly winning now -+(-5 and change). Before this, the best evaluation for white was still favoring black, but not nearly by as much: -+ 2.15 with Rfe2; and Bb1 and Rff1 and Kg1 were possible, although slightly less accurate.} Bxe4+ {Here my opponent resigned. A good example of creating counter play in the Caro-Kann that even without that white rook move, had black increasing the advantage. This has probably been my best 'Blitz' play, for accuracy and opening principle both. Now, as an aside, look at the pawn structure. Although often black has a pawn on h6, white's pawn structure is, to be blunt, rather destroyed. In an endgame, I believe black would have had the advantage, and that is what I try to play for. If you want something far simpler to play with than the Sicilian, with good drawing and some winning chances, this is not a bad opening to try. Hope you enjoyed this one, feel free to critique.}
