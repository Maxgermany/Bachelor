1. d4 d5 2. e3 {My approach is both more cautious and more aggressive than prior tries.} Nf6 3. Nf3 g6 4. Nbd2 Bg7 5. b3 O-O 6. Bb2 e6 7. Be2 Nbd7 8. O-O a6 9. c4 {I would rather keep his bishops hemmed in even if for the moment I suffer from the same.} c6 10. cxd5 cxd5 11. Rc1 b5 12. h3 Bb7 13. Qc2 {This seems like a mistake, but I seem to get so little from it.} Rc8 14. Qb1 Qb6 15. Rxc8 Rxc8 16. Rc1 {!} Qd8 17. Rxc8 Qxc8 18. Qc1 {It is either I am compelled to move my bishop or he is compelled to move his.} Qxc1+ 19. Bxc1 Ne4 {Probably somewhat dubious, but the exchange also disrupts his formation.} 20. Nxe4 dxe4 21. Nd2 f5 {And promotes my own formation.} 22. Bb2 Nb6 {Pivoting to a square I control.} 23. Ba3 Nd5 24. Bc5 Nc3 {!} 25. Kf1 Nxa2 26. Nb1 {Attempting to trap the knight.} b4 27. Ke1 a5 28. Kd2 Bd5 {Otherwise he would succeed in winning a pawn when the knights are exchanged.} 29. Kc2 e5 {The pawn literally accomplishes little where it stands, but...} 30. Kb2 {29...e5 opens the path for the strong move Bc4 which generates an absolute pin on the d5 bishop.  Black has no real defense of the bishop so he would be forced to exchange when the white pawn structure is nearly textbook perfect if only for now.  White misses the idea or discounts its credibility and instead forces the knight exchange.} Nc3 31. Nxc3 bxc3+ 32. Kxc3 {Who is really better?  Both sides have the bishop pair and can deliver mate if the other side is not careful.  White can force the LS bishop exchange after which he will have an isolated c pawn to match black's isolated a pawn.} exd4+ 33. exd4 Kf7 {Black sees the bishop exchange threat as well as the fact that the white king is influencing play.  It is time for the black king to put his influence on the board.} 34. Bb6 e3 {Black cannot defend the a pawn, so he gets an active bishop for it and a shot at destroying the white pawn structure, but this game may end up being a case where the weaker pawn structure wins.  The Bc4 idea no longer seems so strong because a promote threat has been injected into the position.} 35. fxe3 Bxg2 36. h4 Bf6 {White's center is good and the h4 pawn cannot escape although white can force an even exchange.} 37. h5 Bg5 38. hxg6+ hxg6 39. Kd2 {The game is very even.} f4 40. exf4 Bxf4+ 41. Kc3 Bg3 {Attempting to either protect the a5 pawn or win his bishop should it capture.} 42. Kd2 Bd5 {Attacking the b pawn while preventing the d pawn from advancing.} 43. Kc2 Be1 {I believe the advantage may be swinging towards black.} 44. Bc4 {And white discovers the bishop exchange.} Ke6 {Okay, but I will use it to advance my king.} 45. Kd3 g5 {White is going to get a good center, but if the bishops come off the board, he will have a tough time defending against the two passed pawns.} 46. Ke2 Bb4 {White only has bishop and king moves.} 47. Ke3 Bxc4 48. bxc4 {Better pawn formation?  Who wouldn't want a pawn on c4 and d4 as white?  Well, earlier at least.  Now it seems likely that black will queen first.} a4 49. Ke4 a3 {White can control a1 now, but its defense makes the game easier for black.  49...Bc3 fails to 50.Kd3 when the black bishop gets tied to the defense of the a pawn.} 50. d5+ Kf6 {Black does not really need either pawn to queen so long as it means that his position improves relative to white's position.  Perhaps that statement is really more of an exaggeration.  White may even still be winning, but 51.c5 fails because the black a pawn will queen first.} 51. Bd4+ Kg6 52. c5 a2 {There are a few promising continuations for white, but to be safe he needs to advance his king.  I am counting on queening first.  My original thoughts were that he can realistically make me abandon the a pawn with a move like d6 shifting the center of play to where he is strongest and can most easily control, but I have to consider that 53.d6 Bxd6 wins the pawn for free because of the a pawn.  The white bishop is already overworked which is why I believe white's best move is Ke5.} 53. c6 {White would be marginally better off abandoning the c pawn and advancing his king.  I originally believed this was weaker than d6 as d6 creates space for his king and forces a defense of the queening squares by Ba5, but as just noted the move fails to Bxc5!  Here, in the position as played, black gets to, without actually attacking a pawn, remove it from the center of play.  I believe here is where the game firmly shifts to black's advantage.  Black has probably been winning for a few moves, but uncertainty was rampant because of the given time controls.  The concept of 'winning' is a dangerous idea in chess because one mistake can reverse it in an instant.} Bd6 {54.Be5 fails because black will simply exchange and then queen.  Black has a plan to exploit the overworked white bishop.} 54. Ba1 g4 55. Bb2 g3 56. Kf3 Kf5 57. Bc3 {And black realizes that he needs to force White to take opposition on the g pawn so that Black can win the White pawns.} Kg5 58. Bd4 Kh4 {!} 59. Kg2 Kg4 60. Bc3 {White underestimates the black idea.  That and his bishop is tied to a1!} Kf4 {! And the game is won.} 61. Ba1 Ke4 {I thought I might see either a desperate pawn advance or a resignation after this move.} 62. Bb2 Kxd5 63. Kf3 Kxc6 {And White resigns.}
