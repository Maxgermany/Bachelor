[White "moondust (1795)"]
[Black "freddz123 (1753)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {Opens up with the standard king's pawn. From here there are a lot of options, avoiding many of the slow build-ups that other opening moves favour.} c5 {The Sicilian, my only response to e4.  I feel a direct challenge to the centre gives White too much advantage, whereas the unbalanced nature of c5 allows Black to attempt to force some of the moves to go his way.} 2. f4 {I've always felt that f4 should not be played until after Nc3, due to the possibility of Black playing d5.  This time, I decided not to play the d5 Pawn, and instead. . .} Nc6 {Developed my Knight.} 3. Nc3 {I believe this is the Sicilian Grand Prix attack.} g6 {Rather than a direct challenge at the centre, I begin to look at a fianchetto to attempt to gain some control.} 4. Bc4 {Attacks my weak f7 Pawn and takes more control over the centre.} Bg7 5. Nf3 e6 6. O-O Nge7 7. h4 {I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably.} d5 {Never one to look at gift horse in the mouth, I capitalise on his mistake by gaining some control of the centre and planning my attack on the White King.} 8. exd5 {Although I hoped he would fall for this and take the Pawn, I hadn't thought that he would.  I had expected the Bishop to retreat to e2 instead.} exd5 {Obvious, now White must cede control over part of the centre.} 9. Be2 {Too late.} O-O 10. d3 Nf5 {Was looking at getting rid of the h-Pawn and threatening the Rook, something like 11.h5 Ng3 12.hxg6 fxg6 13.Rf2.  Or I could've ignored the Pawn and gone through with something like 11.h5 Ng3 12.hxg6 Nxf113.gxh7+ Kxh7 14.Bxf1.  Wasn't sure which line I preferred yet, but White had other ideas anyway.} 11. h5 Ng3 12. Re1 {Saving his Rook.} Nxh5 {I decide to get the Pawn out of the way before it can cause any problems to my King's defence.} 13. Bf1 {Again, I question this move.  I see what he was looking at, gaining the open e-file for his Queen, but it basically allowed me to pin his Knight.  I'd have looked at 13.Ne5 Nxf4 14.Bxf4 Nxe5 15.Bf3 Nxf3+ 16.Qxf3 Bd4+.  Not much better, but I think White was running out of options by now.} Bg4 {Expected pin.} 14. Qd2 {I think we can safely call this move a blunder.  14...Bxf3 15.Qf2 Bg4 16.Nd1 Bxd1 17.Rxd1 and White is in some serious trouble.  I can't see a winning move for White, but how about Ne2?  Removes the pin, but after 14...Bxf3 15.gxf3 Nd4 16.Bg2 Nxe2+ 17.Qxe2 Bd4+ it's not a great deal better.} Bxf3 15. gxf3 {I think Qf2 was slightly better as posted above.  gxf3 allows me to swoop in for the kill all too quickly.} Bd4+ 16. Kh2 {Blunder number 2 from White, this one is fatal as it moves him into mate - 16...Qh4+ 17.Bh3 Qg3+ 18.Kh1 Qxh3+ 19.Qh2 Ng3#.  Again, can't really see a saving move for White, but maybe 16.Re3?  With 16...Bxe3+ 17.Qxe3 d4 18.Qf2 dxc3 19.bxc3 Qf6 20.f5 Qxf5 to follow?} Qh4+ 17. Kg2 {And White admits defeat.  Fun game and a positive start to my first chess tournament :o)}
