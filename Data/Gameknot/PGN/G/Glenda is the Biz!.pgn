1. c4 {Hi everyone!  Another tight middle game battle turns in my favour.  This time, Glenda, whose magic powers are sometimes as good as Mildred Hubble's in Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch manages to get into the enemy camp and turn a couple of enemy pawns into sludge before she exchanges herself for the Wicked Witch of the West.  I then manage to simplify further until Bob voluntarily enters a K & P ending.  What did I say about these endings when you are a pawn or more down in material?  Just don't go there......} Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. e4 {4. e4 - a typically English opening - I now control the centre with e4 and try to discourage d5.  Both sides now develop their pieces over the next few moves.} d6 5. d4 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O {7. 0-0 - an impressive white pawn centre, Henry castled, what more does a girl called Joanne want?} Nc6 8. Be3 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 10. Bc1 f5 11. d5 Ne7 12. Ng5 {12. Ng5 - I return the compliment of black's 8th move.  This move puts the question to black's advanced steed on g4.  Black does not wish his pawn structure to be compromised so he retreats the knight.} Nf6 13. Bf3 fxe4 14. Ngxe4 Nf5 15. Be2 c5 16. Nxf6+ Bxf6 {16. ....... Bxf6 - one pair of knights exchanged.} 17. Bd3 a6 18. Ne4 Be7 19. Bd2 {19. Bd2 - development complete.} Bd7 20. Qc1 {20. Qc1 - preparing a possible Bh6.} b5 21. b3 Nd4 22. Re1 bxc4 23. bxc4 Rb8 24. Rb1 Rxb1 25. Qxb1 {25. Qxb1 - one pair of rooks is exchanged and Glenda controls the b file.} Bf5 26. Qb7 {26. Qb7 - Glenda dares venture into the enemy camp - she is attacking the loose pawn on a6 but .......} Bc8 {26. ........ Bc8! - ........ she is driven back.  The black lsb protects the pawn on a6 x-ray fashion.} 27. Qb1 Bh4 28. Be3 Qe7 29. Qb6 {29. Qb6 - If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!} Nf5 30. g3 Nxe3 31. Rxe3 Bf6 {31. ........ Bf6? - this retreat now transforms Glenda the Defender into Glenda the Offender.  One pawn drops .........} 32. Qxd6 Qg7 33. Nxf6+ Rxf6 34. Qxe5 {34. Qxe5 - ...... and another!} Qf7 35. Qe8+ Qxe8 36. Rxe8+ Rf8 37. Rxf8+ Kxf8 {37. ........ Kxf8 - a same bishop ending two pawns up, this game should definitely be in white's favour - time for Henry to emerge from the trenches ....... don't worry Henry, the Wicked Witch is dead!} 38. Kg2 Ke7 39. Kf3 Kd6 40. Kf4 {40. Kf4 - As far as Henry is concerned it is ...... Quick ....... March!} a5 {40. ......... a5 - tries for some queenside action but to no avail.} 41. Kg5 Ke5 42. Kh6 Bf5 {42. ......... Bf5 - this only delays the loss of the g pawn and gets me into that won K & P ending that jstevens1 strives for!} 43. Bxf5 gxf5 44. Kxh7 a4 45. Kg7 {45. Kg7 - now Bob, where do you want Glenda to re-appear?  d8 or h8?  Neither says Bob, I surrender!  That's all for now folks!}
