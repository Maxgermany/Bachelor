1. e4 c5 {Mini Tournament match, this is our second game of the tournament, score 1-0 favoring me. This game I'm black, and my opponent gets some payback. I open with the Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 {White goes with the Open Sicilian and black responds with the Classical line.} 6. Bb5 Bd7 {The book recommends 6. Bg5 (Richter-Rauzer Attack) or 6. Bc4 (Main Line of the Classical Variation). White chose a 6th move that isn't in my short little book. Back to the DB I go...} 7. O-O g6 8. Nd5 Bg7 {Kind of an odd way to get to the Dragon.} 9. Nxc6 bxc6 10. Nxf6+ Bxf6 11. Bc4 Rb8 {After the exchanges in the center, black seizes the half-open file with his rook.} 12. Rb1 Qc8 13. b3 O-O 14. Bb2 Bxb2 {More exchanging. I feel that multiple exchanges might favor white, given the disparity of our ratings. I would rather keep the board complicated, but this exchange was almost unavoidable.} 15. Rxb2 Bg4 16. f3 Bd7 17. c3 d5 {Something must be done to break up the center.} 18. exd5 cxd5 19. Qxd5 Be6 20. Qd2 Rd8 {Not a necessary move, but it is a handy little zwischenzug to get a black rook on the open d-file.} 21. Qc1 Bxc4 22. bxc4 Rxb2 23. Qxb2 Qxc4 {OK, all back to even steven, but black's pawn structure seems a little better. Still, white does have that passed pawn.} 24. Qa3 Qc7 25. Re1 e6 26. h3 Rd3 {Time to hunt the passed pawn.} 27. Rc1 Qg3 {Look how sneaky. If  white's not careful, black might sneak a rook onto the 2nd rank and it's game over on g2. Of course, it's not forced, so white would have to let it happen.} 28. Qxa7 Rd2 29. Qa8+ Kg7 30. f4 Qe3+ {Now white was the one being sneaky, defending g2 from afar, but now he loses two pawns.} 31. Kh1 Rxa2 {One.} 32. Qxa2 Qxc1+ 33. Kh2 Qxc3 {Two. Whew, black dodged a bit of a bullet. From being down by a pawn and facing two white passed pawns, to now being up a pawn, though the game is far from won.} 34. Qf2 f6 {And there it is, black's big blunder. 34. ... f6? was a mistake that guarantees a draw. Consolodating the queen, inching the pawns forward, looking for queen exhantes, trying to create a passed pawn, trying not to let white get in front of it and hold onto a draw - that's what black should have done. Instead, I did this...} 35. Qa7+ Kh6 {Only one place to go that doesn't offer white a draw by perpetual check.} 36. Qe7 g5 {White forked two pawns. Worse is the threat of forced checkmate in 3 starting with 37. Qf8+ Kh5 38. g4+ Kh4 39. Qh6# unless black stops it right now, leaving his pawns out to die. } 37. fxg5+ Kxg5 {Black has two pawns hanging, which one will white kill?} 38. Qxe6 Qe5+ {I think white might have made the wrong decision. Taking the pawn at h7 gives white a passed pawn. Maybe he can find a way to promote, maybe not, but after capturing at h7, black will be playing for a draw. But by capturing at e6, now black is the one who will get a passed pawn and it will be white playing for a draw. Either way, both lines would likely be draws, but it seems better to put your opponent on the defensive rather than the other way around. Black forces the queen exchange and gains his passed pawn.} 39. Qxe5+ fxe5 {This game is a dead draw, unless one of the players has no idea how to play engames.} 40. Kg3 e4 {I could have offered a draw here, or either of the previous two moves, but I wanted my opponent to show me he could handle himself in an endgame first. Obviously, white wants to get in front of the black pawn on e4, and if he does so, then we have a draw. But if he backs off to h2, an obvious mistake, then black wins. So, I give white the rope to see if he'll hang himself.} 41. h4+ Kf5 42. Kf2 Ke5 {Just a bit more rope. If white carelessly plays 43. Kg3???, a move that seems natural, then black wins with something like this: 43. ... 44. Kf2 Kd3 45. Ke1 h5 46. g3 e3 47. Kd1 e2+ 48. Ke1 Ke3 49. g4 hxg4 50. h5 g3 51. h6 g2 52. h7 g1=Q#  } 43. Ke3 {Final position. White made the right move, then offered a draw which black accepted.}
