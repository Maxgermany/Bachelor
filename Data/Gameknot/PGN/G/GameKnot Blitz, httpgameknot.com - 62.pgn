[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {A quick little blitz game i had on my lunch break awhile ago. } Nf6 {At this point i was thinking KID.} 2. Nf3 {Developing my Knight and adding a defender to d4.} g6 {He prepares to fianchetto his dark squared bishop.} 3. c4 {Using the wings to help control the center of the board. I also like putting my queen on the c2 square along with the light squared bishop on d3. I like having control of that b1-h7 diagonal as well as having my pieces aimed at the King side.} Bg7 {He fianchetto's his dark squared Bishop.} 4. Nc3 {Develops another minor piece as well as prepares for e4.} d6 {Preparing for an e5 pawn push. At this current juncture i really wasn't sure where i wanted the direction of this game to go. I tend to like having the b1-h7 diagonal open for my queen and bishop, which helps when going for a King side attack.} 5. e4 {Taking firm control of the center of the board. Common in the KID.} Nbd7 {Further preparation e5. If the pawn is pushed prematurely, then dxe5. If dxe5, an exchange of queens would leave black without the ability to castle.} 6. Bd3 {Bolstering up the center pawn as well as getting my bishop on that diagonal.} e5 {the e5 pawn push. I really didn't want a closed game, so i was very hesitant about d5. } 7. Qc2 {Keeping the tension in the center as well as aiming my pieces at the King side.} exd4 {I'm not sure about this move? It breaks the tension but other than that i can't really find a purpose for taking.} 8. Nxd4 {Taking back with the knight. Here i like my position. I wouldn't say white has a huge advantage, however white does have a lead in development as well as more space and control in the center. Black's light squared bishop is also temporarily blocked in.} Ne5 {I really don't want to exchange right now. I would much rather keep the complexity of the board.} 9. Be2 Be6 10. b3 {Reinforcing c4. From here i wanted to get my king to a safe place and remove his knight from the center of the board. Other than that i really don't have a solid plan of action.} a6 {I'm assuming this is to reinforce a b5 pawn push, however i am not entirely sure why this was played.} 11. f4 Nc6 12. Nxc6 {I decide to exchange, doubling up his pawns.} bxc6 13. O-O {Tucking the king away in a safe corner. Keeping the King in the middle usually creates attacking chances for the other player later down the road.} Bg4 14. Bd3 {Again, not wanting to exchange. I would rather keep some complexity. In retrospect i'm wondering if it would of been better to exchange. } d5 {I thought this was a mistake. Perhaps he was trying to undouble his pawns?} 15. e5 Ne4 {I wasn't sure why this move was made... it loses a pawn with what looks to me like no compensation.} 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Bxe4 {Now the board has cleared up a little bit and i am feeling pretty comfortable. Blacks dark squared bishop is blocked in for the time being and whites bishops have a decent scope. I think Whites pawn structure is a bit better however i don't know much about pawn structure. If anyone has any thoughts about that please share.} Qd4+ {I overlooked this. This could of been a costly oversight had it not been for my bishop threatening c6. Just goes to show, developing your pieces is key.} 18. Kh1 Bf5 {I also think this is a mistake as it hangs the c6 pawn.} 19. Bxc6+ {From here it is pretty clear that white has the advantage. There really aren't any major threats from black that i can see.} Kf8 20. Qf2 {Practically forces the exchange of queens.} Qxa1 {This move loses.} 21. Ba3+ {And black resigned here. good game monstruo777.}
