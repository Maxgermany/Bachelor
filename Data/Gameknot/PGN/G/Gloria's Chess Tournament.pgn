1. e4 {Hello hiredgun112 fans and followers.Here is a short annotation from me please leave input.Have a great day.He opens with e4} e5 {I answer with e5.This is a standard answer move for me.If you notice lately i have been opening with d4 if i am white.} 2. Ne2 {Brings out his kingside cowboy} Bc5 {Trying something a little different bring out kingside bishop instead of knight first} 3. g3 {not really understanding this move} Nf6 {bring out my kingside cowboy,i believe iam ahead in development} 4. Bh3 {putting pressure on my Queen} Nc6 {Both of my cowwboys out now} 5. b3 {Perplexed by this move} O-O {i castle} 6. c4 {he does have a chain here} Nxe4 {I have  good control of center} 7. a4 {to much pawn movement no development} Qg5 {notice my bishop and queen placement} 8. f3 {trying to scare cowboy,i ain't skeered!} Bf2+ {put on check with Bf2 cover with Ne4} 9. Kf1 d6 {look at bishops and queen} 10.
