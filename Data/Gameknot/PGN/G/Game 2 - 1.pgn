[Opening "Sicilian (B21), Grand Prix attack"]

1. e4 {This is a game from the 60th GameKnot Tournament, Expert section. I was black in this game. I played quite well overall, but the game was pretty messy and one slip could have proven fatal, which is indeed what happened. Once again, comments always welcome and thank you for taking the time of going through the game.} c5 2. f4 {The Grand Prix attack. Not so popular nowadays as 2.Nf3 or 2.c3, I'm not sure how it compares to other possibilities like 2.d4 or 2.Nc3.} d5 {One of the main responses. Black doesn't waste time in challenging for the centre. Other possibilities include 2...e6, 2...Nc6 or 2...g6.} 3. e5 {A more common response is 3.exd5, but the text move is also playable.} Nc6 4. Nf3 e6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 {I'm not so sure about this trade, to be honest, though I guess white envisioned this becoming a more closed game, where knights would be better than bishops. Also, black's light-square bishop is technically a bad bishop, but so is white's dark-squared one.} Bxc6 7. d4 {Potentially preventing the same move by black, which would open up the a8-h1 diagonal for black's bishop.} Nh6 {Heading for the f5-square.} 8. c3 Nf5 9. O-O {9.g4, kicking the knight away, would probably be too risky. Black would counter with 9...Nh4 and then 10.O-O h5 and black's game is good.} h5 {Preventing g2-g4, thus enabling the knight to remain on f5, as well as preparing to advance the pawn. This manoeuvre is actually more common on the opposite side of the board, as in certain King's Indian variations, where black will place his knight on c5 and solidify it with a5 to prevent b2-b4.} 10. Kh1 {Maybe a loss of time, white could simply continue with his development with something like 10.Na3 or try 10.Qe1 as in the game. White was probably trying to avoid a pin on the a7-g1 diagonal after a possible Qb6 and cxd4.} h4 {In certain lines Ng3+ might now become a threat. 10...Qb6 was also possible.} 11. b3 {Preparing to develop the bishop on a3. Again 11.Na3 was an alternative.} Qc7 {Here I decided I would castle queenside (which isn't customary in the Sicilian for black, but rules are meant to be broken, right?) and try to attack on the kingside. 11...Qa5 was also possible, attacking the c3-pawn if the b1-knight should move, as was 11...Qb6. I decided for a less direct approach.} 12. Qe1 {White can't simply develop automatically with Nbd2, since that would run into the Ne3 fork. So, 12.Qe1 protects the e3 square and prepares Nbd2. On the downside, the queen was also protecting d4, which might come under attack after something like cxd4, Qb6 etc. Of course, black has to be wary of opening the c-file after the intended queenside castling. White might have tried 12.Qd3, protecting both e3 and d4. Maybe white wasn't sure about placing the queen and the rook on the same diagonal.} O-O-O {Following my plan, but here I missed a cute tactic: 12...Bb5! 13.Rf2 (13.Rg1?? Ng3+) Ng3+! 14.Kg1 Ne4 15.Rb2 (15.Rc2 Bd3) and white's position with the fianchettoed rook is really awkward, though he should eventually untangle. It's often inadvisable to venture into tactical skirmishes before completing one's development, so 12...O-O-O it is.} 13. Nbd2 Be7 {Maybe 13...Bb5 was an alternative, but again I preferred to simply develop.} 14. Ng5 {(?) I'd call this a mistake, it invites Bxg5, ridding black of the two bishops and giving rise to a bishops of opposite colour position, but it also loses a pawn. So, I would recommend 14.Ba3 or 14.a4 here.} Bxg5 {The obvious move, but 14...cxd4! was even stronger and more precise. I didn't even look at it, since I was mainly concerned with the obvious Nxf7 threat. So, 14...cxd4 15.Nxf7 (15.cxd4 Bxg5 16.fxg5 Nxd4 transposes into the game continuation) dxc3 16.Nf3 d4 and the two pawns are really strong, the exchange would hardly be a sacrifice there.} 15. fxg5 cxd4 16. cxd4 {Transposing to the line I mentioned after 14...Bxg5. White could have tried 16.Rxf5!? exf5 17.cxd4 instead, but in any case black is already better, which means white's choice of opening probably wasn't the best.} Nxd4 {And black is simply up a pawn. Of course, now comes the hard part, how to try and convert this advantage into a win.} 17. Qf2 {Attacking both d4 and f7, but black has a simple response.} Nf5 {Retreating the knight to safety, as well as threatening 18...Ng3+.} 18. Kg1 {Sort of a proof that 10.Kh1 might not have been the best.} Qxe5 {Winning the second pawn.} 19. Ba3 d4 {Advancing the passed pawn as well as opening up the bishop's diagonal.} 20. Rac1 Kb8 {Unpinning the bishop, but that wasn't really such a problem. 20...h3 was also possible, where after 21.g3 (21.Rc5? Qxh2+!!) Ne3 22.Rc5 Rd5 white is also on the ropes. The immediate 20...Ne3 is also playable, 21.Rc5 Qc7 22.Qxf7 Nxf1 23.Qxe6+ Kb8 24.Nxf1, where black is up an exchange and has the dangerous passed d-pawn.} 21. Nc4 Qd5 22. h3 {White obviously doesn't want trades as in 22.Qf3 Qxf3.} Ne3 {Maybe not so wise in retrospect, it wasn't a bad move at all, but going for tactics probably wasn't the correct approach here. I think 22...f6, preparing e5, was the way to go.} 23. Qf4+ Ka8 24. Rf3 {White is trying hard to hang on.} Nf5 {Why not 24...Nxc4, simplifying when ahead? Surely that would have been the more pragmatic decision.} 25. Ne5 Be8 {(??) Trying to both preserve the bishop and defend f7, but I completely overlooked white's reply. 25...Ng3!, threatening Ne2+ and forcing 26.Rxg3, was much better, as was 25...d3 (26.Nxf7? Nd4). Funny how both times white threatened the fork on f7 I panicked, went for the safe approach and directly prevented it, instead of looking at the position more thoroughly for possible tactics. The first time on move 14 I didn't really commit an error this way, but this time I did and it was costly. I guess what we can learn from all of this is that we should never react automatically and always look for hidden possibilities.} 26. Rc5 {! - Suddenly it dawned on me, the queen has nowhere to go! I was so demoralized  I didn't even try to fight on with 26...Qd6 27.Rc8+ Rxc8 28.Bxd6 Nxd6, but simply resigned, angry and disappointed with myself. White would be better there, but I could still give him a run for his money. Nevertheless, I congratulate my opponent and praise his resourcefulness even when his position was on the brink of disaster. I had to demonstrate my win and I didn't, once again proving Lasker's maxim that “the hardest game to win is a won game”.}
