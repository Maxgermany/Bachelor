[Round "1"]
[White "jotheblackqueen (1927)"]
[Black "charleshiggie (2076)"]
[Opening "Sicilian (B55), Prins variation, Venice attack"]

1. e4 {I wasn't sure exactly how Joann would open, but this is what I predicted.  And, I base it on the first move of the Sicilian.  The thing is that Charles favorite defense is also the Sicilian, and white knows this.  } c5 {And, she lets Charles have his way.} 2. Nf3 {I'm not surprised to see Joann opt for the Open Variation.  This is what I see in a lot of charleshiggie's annotations.  I'm also very accustomed because, as noted in one of his more recent annotations, The Nadjorf Sicilian is one of the very first things that I had to learn.  And, the first opening that Jack made me learn, btw, was the Spanish Opening.  It would be much later on that I'd walk away from that and, instead, play the Italian Opening.} d6 {The main continuation, to make a long story short.} 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3 {I anticipated 5.Nc3 to protect, as I know from the lines I play.  But, I recently learned in Charles annotation that this is also true in the Dragon Sicilian, where instead of 5...a6, black fianchetto's with 5...g6.  But, I, personally, don't like this move as Joann just advanced her weakest pawn on the board.  It appears that this will leave her monarch vulnerable to exposure, but what do I know, anyway?} e5 {Going after the N which I like.  Believe it or not, this is what I also would've played, but it, more then likely, would've been for the wrong reason, as well.  My attitude would be to try and punish white for advancing the f pawn.  I thought similarly against Carl and Tom Walsh.  That is, when they played something that I didn't like.} 6. Nb3 Be6 {This would've been one of the reason, as Charles continues with development.  Although we know for certain that noone has the advantage, yet, I, personally, favor black's position here.} 7. c4 {I don't know why Joann played this since it wasn't a 1.d4 d5 opening where you'd normally think about the c pawn before developing the Nb1.  Having said that, I would've played 7.Nc3, at once.} Nbd7 {I would've played 7...Nc6, but I like Charles move.  However, it's for the wrong reason, as well.  It's only because Jack once told me that when you develop a N, so generally to f3 or c3 as white, then you're usually better off bringing the other one to either e2 or d2.  But, he was alluding to, if you were up against stronger opposition which isn't the case.  Having said that, I'll use the same logic but on the reverse side of things since it came from black, given that he played 4...Nf6, as part of the Open Sicilian.} 8. Be3 {Continuing with her development.  I would've done the same, but with the Bf1 instead.  As my reason would be to just castle sooner.  I hate to admit it, but that reason really isn't valid since it's not always a good idea to castle, just because it's possible to do so.  Similar to what I noted, before my first online training game with ubermensch43 Joann had that thread about, "When and When it's Safe to Castle".  Shortly before the kibitzing, I said that one should always castle, ASAP short.  This was before learning that it was, sometimes, better to castle long.  And, it was right before Fred realized that I didn't have experience.  In fact, I was still a novice at the time, with my ELO Rating being under 900.  Even after everything cleared, and I apologized to people, as is shown on my profile, I always stuck to how good it is to castle early.  It's because ION quoted a GM who said, "Castle early and often."  That was until something happened, which wasn't WTW by definition since it didn't involve a game where I'd be checkmated by an Expert or GM.  But, a near equivalent happened with nuntar where he quoted GM Bertin about this in my last Wizard Chess game.  "Do not castle except when strictly necessary, for the move (i.e. initiative) is often lost by it". } Rc8 {Going right after c4.  Although my idea would be 8...Be7 for the reason noted earlier, I also would've played this for the same reason.  A lot of times, when I see a move that I don't like, I'll go on the offense.  As my idea of a good time is taking away, at least, a tempo from the opponent since Joann will have to defend.  That's especially since she'll be forced to place one of her N's on the rim where it might be vulnerable, or even, en-prise later on.} 9. Na3 a6 {But, with this move, I see the logic, and even though it's still the wrong definition, it's not that much different from WTW with my comment above.  This move makes me realize that Joann had a threat with her last move.  Except for the a pawn being en-prise, I didn't know what the threat was since Charles would still be able to protect the same way.  But, there's something about 10.Nb5 that would've been nasty for black which is why he would play that.  Having said that, I would've overlooked the threat and, more then likely, would be lost here.  However, due to needing that mental workout, I decided to do HW here.  And, through that, I discovered that white is threatening to win the d6 pawn.  To make things worse, that pawn is in the center which would also affect center control.  It didn't appear possible.  Similar to what happened with Ken, where I was corrected, my thinking was that if 10.Nxd6 10...Bxd6??, and black's problems are resolved.  Not only that, but feeling like I'm up a piece for a pawn, I'd be happy.  But, that's not the case, for I would've forgotten about white's Q which would've left black a pawn down.  Having said that, I would've missed this with 9...Be7? for the same reason.  But, this is a perfect example of where one would likely lose with the castling idea.  It's also easy for one to think that if you only lose a pawn, you have a disadvantage that can be compensated for.  But, pawns are more important then one would realize, especially since they're in the center.  As they can become passed which Jack and elyhim, in our training game rightly pointed out.  That's why one of them emphasized, "don't give things away."} 10. Be2 {But, now is the time as Joann is ready to do this.} Be7 {As is Charles.} 11. O-O O-O 12. Rc1 {Protecting c4 again, but I don't see the point since Joann isn't going to move her N off of the rim.} Nh5 {I, at first, didn't see the point behind this move since Charles N is also on the rim.  My thinking was that, maybe, he intended to play 13...Bh4, where there's pressure on the K side.  But, Joann would then be able to go on the offense with 13.g3.  However, Joann was threatening to exchange that N for her Be3.  And, his piece is more active.  As after 13.Bg5, if Charles answer with 13...Nh5, the exchange will still be forced after 14.g4 since the N would be trapped.} 13. Qd2 {So, Joann goes right after the K side instead.  At the time, I wouldn't have seen the point, until my last game, with id=bhidragon.  And, with that, 14.Bh6 is a threat as she is threatening a piece sac for a pawn.  But, the idea behind it is that 14...gxh6 would expose the K.  And, the situation would, I'm pretty sure, would be even worse after 15.Qxh6.} Nf4 {And, Charles puts a stop to that.  He'd rather not exchange N for B, but if that's the only way keep the monarch safe, he'd do it.} 14. Rfd1 {But, Joann has other ideas, instead.  I'm just not sure what that is.  } Nxe2+ {Meanwhile, Charles gets right to it by forcing the exchange.  So, I'm just not sure how, but somehow, Joann's LSB became more active then his N.} 15. Qxe2 Qe8 {Unlike before, I don't see the point behind this move.  Instead, I would've tried to attack c4 again with 15...Qc7  As my idea behind it would be to follow up with 16...Nb6} 16. Nd2 {And, with that, I like this move since Joann defends again.} f5 {Trying to go after the Be3.  The only thing that I don't like about this move is that it appears to weaken black's K for the same reason that I thought f3 did.  But, I like everything else about it.  That's, especially, with what he intend to do to Joann's B.} 17. b3 {Meanwhile, Joann defends c4 again.  I wouldn't have seen the need to do it since it was already defended by both N's+the Rc1+ the Q.  Instead, I would've tried to prevent Charles next move with 17.exf5.} f4 18. Bf2 g5 {While I normally dislike this move for the same thing that I didn't like about 16...f5, there's something else about this even more.  And, that's what makes me like the move played.  This gives Charles a pawn chain which might be very useful later on.  As the pawns are well connected.} 19. Qd3 {Bringing the Q to a more mobile square.  I also discovered something else because of what Charles will play on his next move.  Joann has a threat on d6 that I'm not seeing.} d5 {But, things get even more interesting, as we enter a series of exchanges.  And, I know why because Joann will give up the exchange, R for N.  And, it's the same idea as what I mentioned in the intro with my chess dream.  Joann's doing this for a dangerous passed pawn as we will see.} 20. cxd5 Rxc1 21. Rxc1 Bxa3 22. dxe6 Bxc1 23. exd7 Qd8 {And, this is the only way to stop it.  But, Joann has something up her sleeve since she will fork on her next move.  On the other hand, it's about how far the Q fork will go.} 24. Qc4+ Rf7 {I'll also mention that I thought Charles would get out of check with 24...Kh8  Of course, there are cases when I don't have to exchange or I get into a different pin where it's a pawn or a minor with another piece, besides the K, right near it.  When that happens, I don't mind getting out of check by interposing with one of my pieces.  But, when it's something like this where the R is pinned, that's the last thing I'd usually want to do which is why I'd move the monarch, instead.  This, however, is an extenuating circumstance.  And, despite how I would've responded, I like Charles approach better.  As Charles can safely get out of this pin with ...Kf8, and when that happens, he'll have another attacker against Joann's passed pawn.} 25. Qxc1 {I said that because of this move since she got a piece.  So, that seems very effective, but she broke Charles pin in the process.  That makes Charles free to take the passer either way, and he will use his R.} Rxd7 26. Be1 {Back in the day, I wouldn't have seen the point behind this move either Joann's N was defended by the Q.  That's true, but this is where Jack emphasized that counting your pieces is important.  The reason being is because the N was only defended once but attacked twice, since Charles has his Q behind the attacker.  So, Joann defends again. } Rc7 {Charles gets upset there and goes right after her Q.  } 27. Qb2 Qd4+ {I don't know why Charles threw in the check.  I would've responded with 27...Qd3 with the idea of 28...Qe2, not just attacking the B, but threatening mate.  And, assuming that white prevents mate with 29.Bf2, black would force an unpleasant N pin with 29...Qd1+.  But, that becomes a question of how sound that plan would be.  I would've thought that it would work, but the plan would be a different form of unsound aggression since Charles didn't play that.  But, with this move, Joann will, of course, exchange Q's.  That's something I would not want to have to do, as black.} 28. Qxd4 exd4 29. Nf1 {Because Joann prevented ...Qd1+, as noted earlier, I don't see the point behind this move.  The N wasn't pinned, and this just appears to undevelops for a reason that I don't consider to be good.} Rc2 {As such, Charles goes right after the a2 pawn.  I'm not at all surprised at how Joann defends it since I would do it the same way, as white.  It's due to the fact that white will have a solid pawn chain, as well.} 30. a4 Re2 {So, Charles goes after the B, instead.} 31. Bd2 {Instead of going elsewhere, this is also what I would've played since it's, of course, guarded by the N.  With that, I sense the same thing that I'd feel, if I had this position.  That is some kind of pressure that Joann has on Charles.} b6 {I'm not completely sure why Charles played this.  But, I believe that the idea is to get a passed pawn.  And, that's based on what would be going through my thought process here.  Having said that, I'd consider the same thing, but my idea would be to continue advancing this pawn chain until it reached the a pawn.  As then, I'd want to exchange them, in an attempt for one of the pawns to become passed.  Now that I think of it, it's an interesting idea that wouldn't quite work.  For, if white is to exchange, she would still have a pawn right next to it, on the b file which would prevent Charles from having a passer.} 32. g3 {Joann's forces an exchange of pawns, as her idea is to get a set of passed pawns.  Now, if I had this position as black, her plan would work.  As I'm picturing how things would be, if I were playing another game with her.  That's because I didn't just have the first game that I lost, as noted in my last annotation, but, rather several games.  One game was very close and almost ended in a draw, but a small miscalculation lost.  And, 2 other games, ended in a draw that we both agreed on.  With that, I also agree with ION that the last one should've been a win for me since I was an exchange ahead but just didn't see a winning continuation.  As is, she does a have a passed pawn that can be stopped by Charles R.  And, I see it happening, sooner or later.} fxg3 33. hxg3 h6 {As I was asking myself how Charles would've handled the situation since I, inadvertently, would've overlooked 34.f4 which, similarly, would've given Joann a set of passed pawns.  That would win for white, sooner then later.  But, he put an immediate stop to that which is also what led to this draw.} 34. f4 {But, Joann won't stop trying more then one passer which will become 2.  But, the focus is on g3, as that's where you get a set from a solid pawn chain, at that.  And, this is how I'd be thinking and what I also would've played as white for the same reason.} g4 {I also would've overlooked this move, but it would be worse to miss this one.  I mentioned about TA in the intro, in the negative way with cheapo tactics.  But, Joe also showed his students one of the ways to disrupt a solid pawn chain, especially, when we're talking about more then one passed pawn like in this position.  He showed a game, and similarly, black brought a pawn down horizontally like this.  The idea was blockading the pawn in front of it, like g3 here.} 35. e5 {Keeping in mind that she has 2 passer, Joann pushes one of them.} Kf7 {And, that is why Charles gets his K involved.} 36. a5 {Thus, Joann shifts her focus on the Q side.  Her idea is also exchanging pawns so that a6 gets blockaded with 37.Bxa5  I hate to say it, but with less experience, I would've fallen victim to that with 36...bxa5?} b5 {And, that is why I'm not surprised to see Charles being the one to blockade.  Believe it or not, this is more similar to what I studied with the SM then what I mentioned with 34...g4.} 37. Bb4 {Still getting the B involved to blockade b4.  But, I would've done it with 37.b4 here, especially since I'd be worried about 37...Rb3 where I'd just take right after that with 38...Rxb3, given that the B would be attacked.} Ke6 {But, Charles played this, instead.  I don't know why since 38.e6+? is, more or less, unplayable for the obvious reason.} 38. Nd2 {Preventing 38...Rb2.} Re3 {So, Charles targets g3, instead.} 39. Kf2 {And, Joann counterattacks which is also what I would've done.} Rd3 {I don't understand the point behind this move.  But, unlike before, it doesn't matter to me since Charles offered Joann a draw given that it's white to move.  Similarly, I also would've offered a draw, if I were black.  And, she accepted the offer which I also would've done, as white, in this position.}
