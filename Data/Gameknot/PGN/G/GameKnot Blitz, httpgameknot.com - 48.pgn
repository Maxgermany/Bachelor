[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), English defence"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening} b6 2. e4 {White obliges by taking the classical center setup, with pawns on d4 and e4} Bb7 {We have now transposed to an Owen's defense. I venture with this opening with Black on occasion} 3. Bd3 {From playing both sides, I've found that this puts the most pressure on Black. } g6 {Another fianchetto?} 4. Nf3 {White continues to build up the center} Bg7 5. O-O d6 6. Nc3 Nd7 {Ok, this is getting ridiculous... } 7. Bf4 e6 8. Re1 Ne7 {A very hypermodern setup for Black. However, I had a feeling that a pawn break was coming soon but I didn't want to overextend} 9. Qd2 h6 10. h4 {It looks weird bringing out the pawn so early but I wanted to stop any counterplay, including 10...g5} a6 {And the other side.} 11. a4 {Same motif} Nc6 {Black derives slightly from his base} 12. d5 {I figured now was the time to make my move and attack Black's structure} Ne7 13. dxe6 fxe6 14. Bc4 {Attacking that weak pawn} e5 {The critical juncture in the game.} 15. Bg5 {?! Rather than retreat, White's bishop ventures forward. In my opinion, this move would be so much better if the Queen was still on d1} hxg5 {Sound the drums!} 16. Nxg5 {Threatening to fork by moving to f7 or e6.} Nf8 {Inviting White to Go to f7, which is rather harmless for Black, I wanted to go for the kill} 17. Bf7+ {? But Black can defend! } Kd7 18. Qe2 {This is where 18. Qg4+ would really, really come in handy. Instead White has to spend another move trying to threaten this.} Kc8 {Black escapes immediate danger but with White's much more active pieces, he must be careful} 19. Red1 Kb8 20. Qc4 {Not quite sure what I was exactly looking for besides getting my pieces over to the Queenside} Rxh4 21. Nf3 Rf4 {! This forces trades, which helps the Black side} 22. Bd5 {The only move to defend the Bishop} Nxd5 23. Nxd5 Bxd5 24. Qxd5 Nd7 {It almost seems as if Black is safe} 25. a5 {I have to open enemy lines and the defense is still somewhat weak} b5 {?! It would have been better to keep the structure as is. This allows White to open more lines with} 26. c4 {! White springs to action! The plan is to get a rook onto the b-file } Nc5 {? Pretty dubious as this allows White to equalize at the least with 27. cxb5 axb5 28. Qxc5 dxc5 29. Rxd8+} 27. cxb5 Rxe4 {? It just goes from bad to worse} 28. Rdc1 {! The quiet move! Black resigns  Why? Well, the threat of 29.Rxc5 is indefensible. 28...Rf4 29. Rxc5 and White is on the attack again. Black can't defend the Queen with 29...Rf8 because of 30. bxa6! threatening Qb7#. If 30...Rxa6 31. Rb5+ Kc8 (31...Ka7 32. Qb7#) 32. Qb7+ Winning the rook.  A poorly played attack by myself but an entertaining game nonetheless}
