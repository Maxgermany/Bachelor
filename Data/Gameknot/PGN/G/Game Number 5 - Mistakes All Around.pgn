[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Queen's pawn opening, something I play against regularly at the coffee shop.  Generally slower than King's pawn, making white make extra moves before being able to castle.  I respond with my usual, expecting the game to move into Queen's Indian opening lines.} 2. Qd3 {Hmmm, I expected either c4, or Nf3.  After some research, I'm told this is the Siberian Attack.  Although d3 is a great square for the queen, I think this is way too early to be placing it there.  It gives black a great chance to plan to attack it.  At the time of the move, I decided against looking into it and so went with my gut instinct.  I felt I would be able to marginalise white's queen and gain the upper hand from here.} d5 {Which I began by immediately challenging for the centre.} 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Bf4 Nb4 {Development moves, before I begin my attack on white's queen.} 5. Qb5+ c6 {White forks my king and my knight.  I fork white's queen and pawn at c2.} 6. Qxb4 {White wins my knight and is up in material} e6 {This is quite possibly the worst move I've made so far on gameknot!  In effect I have given my knight away for free.  e5 was the better move, forking white's queen and ds-bishop.  After 7.Qd2 exf4 8.Qxf4 I'd have won a bishop for a pawn.} 7. Qc3 a5 8. Ne5 {Thankfully, white decided to emulate me and made his own unforced error.  After 8...Bb4 9.a3 Bxc3+ 10.Nxc3, black wins a queen for a bishop.} Bb4 {Pin on white's queen and allows black to make the short castle} 9. Nf3 Qb6 {Rather than immediately take white's queen, I position myself to be able to take advantage of white's weakened queenside defense, knowing that as soon as white plays. . .} 10. Bd2 {Bd2 and releases the pin I can play Bxc3 and take white's queen.} Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Ne4 12. g4 {Another error from white.  After 12...Nxc3 13.b3 Nxb1 14.Rxb1, black wins a bishop and a knight for a knight.  b3 was the better move, after 12...e5 13.e3 Nxc3 14.Nxc3} Nxc3 13. bxc3 {White decides to isolate his own pawn at a2, allowing for. . .} Qb2 {A threat of checkmate (Qc1#),  but more importantly traps white's rook at a1.} 14. Na3 Qxa1+ {In response, white hangs the knight at a3 and the pawn at c3.  Better was Kd2, because now black can smell victory!} 15. Kd2 Qxa2 {Black traps white's knight at a3 and creates a passed pawn on a5} 16. Ne5 Qxa3 {Black has now successfully won a rook, a knight and a pawn in the last sequence of moves} 17. Rg1 {I prefered Bg2 for white here. . .} O-O {but I also think I should've played Qa1 rather than the short castle} 18. e3 f6 {Another poor move from black, should've been Qa1.  } 19. Nf3 b6 {And again, poor move from black.  Should've probably played Qb2 after 20.Bd3 a4 21.Ke2 a3 22.Nd2 a2} 20. g5 fxg5 21. Be2 Ba6 22. Rxg5 {22.Bd1 was much better, after 22...Qb2 23.e4 a4 24.exd5 a3 25.dxc6 a2 26.Be2 Bxe2 27.Kxe2 Qxc3 28.Ra1 Qxf3+ 29.Kd2 Qxc6 30.f3 Qxf3.} Bxe2 {Exchanges bishops to speed towards the endgame.} 23. Kxe2 Qxc3 24. Ne1 {White steps into the forced mate, after 24...Rxf2+ 25.Kxf2 Rf8+ 26.Nf3 Qd2+ 27.Kg3 Qxe3 28.Kh3 Qxf3+ 29.Rg3 Qh5+ 30.Kg2 Qf5 31.Rxg7+ Kxg7 32.h4 Qf1+ 33.Kg3 Qg1+ 34.Kh3 Rf3#.} Qc4+ {Obviously black was oblivious to this, after playing a game full of mistakes why should we stop now? :)} 25. Nd3 Qxc2+ {But wait!  Thankyou very much white, black now has a mate in 8.  26.Ke1 Qxd3 27.Rg2 a4 28.h4 Rf3 29.h5 Raf8 30.Rxg7+ Kxg7 31.h6+ Kxh6 32.e4 Re3+ 33.fxe3 Rf1#} 26. Ke1 Qxd3 27. Rg2 a4 28. h4 Ra5 {Whoops, black should've played Rf3 to continue the mate in 6.  However, this only extends the game by 1 move, after 29.f4 Qxe3+ 30.Kd1 Rxf4 31.Kc2 Qe4+ 32.Kc3 Qxd4+ 33.Kc2 Rc5+ 34.Kb1 Rf1+ 35.Ka2 Ra1#} 29. h5 Rb5 30. h6 Rb1# {But white decides he's had enough.  Fun game, even if I did make alot of mistakes I enjoyed it!}
