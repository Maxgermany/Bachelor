1. c4 {Kings Indian Defence variation, while Geoff go's for the start of an open game. } e5 {Geoff has decided to play an open game} 2. g3 {Kings Indian Defence variation still being played out.} Nf6 {Geoff has chosen to play the knight for multiple defences's & offences reason still to be seen.} 3. Bg2 Ng4 4. Nf3 Bc5 5. e3 {Stopping the enitiveable double attack from the knight & bishop} e4 {Geoff takes advantage of an ill placed knight.} 6. Bh3 {I respond by offering him a trade off.} Nxe3 {Geoff goes for the extra piece up on me, many to temp me using the wrong pawn to attack.} 7. dxe3 {Using the Queens pawn to kill the knight I achieve two things, freedom of movement & a healthier wall for my King when I castle him.} exf3 {The trade-off with the knights is over with geoff coming out with an extra pawn plus a pawn deep into my territory. } 8. Qxf3 {That's freedom of movement for ya.} O-O 9. O-O d6 {A good move really, he defends his Kings Bishop while offering up a trade-off with my Kings bishop. I either have the choice of taking the trade-off or retreating back to g2.} 10. Bxc8 {I decided to take the trade-off.} Qxc8 11. Nc3 {I thought it was time to get some of my piece's out.} Nd7 {Instead of moving the Knight to c6, geoff has seen that in 2 turns he can get his knight into a more faverable position by moving to d7, then d7-e5 where the pawn defends the knight & the knight has the queen in its sights.} 12. Nd5 Ne5 13. Qe4 Re8 14. f4 {This is an excellent move, forcing the knight to retreat & giving me the oppertunity draw the rook out enough for my Queen to take the easy kill. } Ng4 15. Ne7+ {Geoff has only 1 option & thats to bring out the Rook before the knight can kill the queen.} Rxe7 {Now the Rooks an easy kill for the Queen.} 16. Qxe7 {Now the Rooks an easy kill for the Queen.} d5 {This is a good move because it sets up 2 attacking possiblities. The pawn & the Queen.} 17. Qxc5 Qf5 {Geoff has seen 1 last way of putting me check which I dont see but wasn't far off from stopping. } 18. Qxd5 {So far I've reacted how you should, while currently anable to stop the Black queen from moving 1 step closer to mate.} Qc2 {Geoff is now only 1 move from check mate. I could've stop it by moving my queen too g2 but my eyes were focussed on getting him in mate.} 19. Qxb7 Qxh2# {}
