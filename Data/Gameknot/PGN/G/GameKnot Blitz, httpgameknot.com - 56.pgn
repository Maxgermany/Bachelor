[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Keres defence"]

1. d4 {He opens with Queen's pawn.} e6 {I play e6, with the idea to play Nimzo-Indian defense.} 2. c4 {Follows with the seizure of center.} Nf6 {Nimzo-indian defense continues.} 3. Nf3 {Develops kingside's knight.} Bb4+ {I develop my Bishop with a check to propose Bishop exchanging, Knight pinning, or to force him to lift up a pawn. The real intentions behind my move is to make way for early kingside castle.} 4. Bd2 {He says it's gonna be Bishop's exchange.} Bxd2+ {I go for it, with a check.} 5. Nbxd2 {He recaptures.} O-O {And then I castle. I'm ready to go ballistic now.} 6. e4 {He totally wants to control the center.} c6 {I lift up c pawn to prepare d5. When I do, we'll know if it is going to be a very closed position or a very open one... My guesses at this moment are it's going to be a closed one, coz he's more likely to play e5 to challenge my knight.} 7. Bd3 {He prepares his castling by developing his kingside bishop.} d5 {I do my move. I am expecting him to play e5 so the position will become closed in the center.} 8. e5 {So he does, he couldn't miss the chance to advance a pawn while also challenging my knight.} Nfd7 {Not many good places for my knight, so I retract it to d7. The idea is to reinforce f6, coz I'm planning to play f5 at some point to disrupt his potential attack on my weak h7 position. If he captures en-passant with e-pawn, then capturing with Nxf6 will reinforce h7.} 9. O-O {He castles.} h6 {I decide I'll lift up a little my h pawn to prevent his knight from going to g5, while also making worthless a battery attack with his bishop and queen on my h7 position.} 10. c5 {He decides he's gonna keep totally closed the center.} f5 {I do my move, if he captures en-passant, I'll develop my knight and will have myself an open controlled file. If he doesn't, I'll totally disable any diagonal attacks on my h7 position. If he wants to break it, he'll have to use his castle g pawn.} 11. a3 {He didn't capture en-passant, so I have a good closed position. He plays a3, my guesses at this point is he's planning to keep a good pawns structure and see if it will be totally closed in this side of the board too, or if it will become open.} b5 {I play b5. The idea is, either we both keep a good pawn structure in that side too, or I'll use a-pawn to capture en-passant and get myself an open a-file.} 12. b4 {He decides not to open the position yet, but to reinforce his pawn's structure.} a5 {But I know I must leave an open file so, either he captures now, or I will capture right after.} 13. bxa5 {He does capture.} Qxa5 {I recapture with the queen.} 14. Nb3 {He challenges my queen with his knight.} Qc7 {I retract her to c7, he has done what I needed her for, so now she can be placed here. I'm planning to get her active later on b or a files.} 15. Nh4 {Of course, nothing prevents his knight from playing Nh4 anymore, so he does. He now starts his siege on the g6 spot.} Rf7 {I know I have to make a good defense in both g7 and g6, so I start by reinforcing g7 with my rock.} 16. Be2 {He doesn't like it, of course, he plays now Be2 to bring him to h5.} Nf8 {My rock has a free passage to get safely to e7, so I play Nf8 to reinforce g6 and to lure his bishop to h5. His knight in h4 will make difficult a direct attack from his queen on e7, so my rock will be safe there for a while. Also, in doing this, I'm giving my bishop a chance to get to e8, and after that, my b knight to d7. At that point, I will have a very good defended position.} 17. Bh5 {Of course, he plays what I was expecting him to. Challenging my rock and also pressing more the g6 position.} Re7 {So, I put my rock safely into e7. I keep defending the g7 position.} 18. Nc1 {His knight can of course make more damage at f4 to press the g6 point and to defend his h5 bishop. So he'll move it there through c1 and d3/e2.} Bd7 {Time to get my bishop to the action point. I move it to d7 first.} 19. Ne2 {His knight continues his journey to f4.} Be8 {I challenge his bishop while also reinforcing g6. I know at this point g6 is going to be the pivot for his attack. Either he takes the bishop or he will take a chance to reinforce the bishop and continue his siege with Nf4.} 20. Nf4 {He does reinforce the bishop.} Nbd7 {And this is one of the 3 best moves in the game for me. I will need at some point get use my f knight to attack his knight at g6, by then, he'll probably have mating chances with his queen in g file, so I'll need immediate back-up in g6 and h7 by replacing my f8 knight with the d7 one. This will save my ass in 2 ocassions later on.} 21. a4 {He decides he's gonna bring his queen into action by forcing me to do a capture or to pass my pawn.} b4 {I decide I'll pass the pawn. This little pawn will be useful later on.} 22. Qb3 {He plays a double attack, first, he challenges my passed pawn, and second, he challenges to take his queen to g file, where his full brute force attack will take place.} Qa5 {I take my queen to a5, to defend my b-pawn and keep his a-pawn from advancing any further.} 23. Qg3 {Queen to g file... He's about to infiltrate my position by sieging from g6. 4 attackers, 2 defenders... Not looking any good for me.} Bxh5 {But then I play Bxh5... This is the second one of the best moves I played in this game. In a single move, I decreased the unbalanced 4 attackers / 2 defenders position to 2 attackers / 1 defender. He just lost the bishop. If he's going to keep the siege on g6 nevertheless, I'll just use the bishop he didn't capture to do yet another capture for myself, so I'd lose control of g6, but he'd have lost a whole piece in a failed attack. He can't afford that of course, And besides he needs to place a knight in h5 to exploit the pinned g-pawn with Nf6+ and do severe mating threats in h7. So, he must capture the bishop with the knight.} 24. Nxh5 {He does capture. Now all he has to do is playing safely the sequence Qg6, Nf6+, Qh7#. But my knight is still on his way. At least, that's the plan.} Rb8 {There's nothing I can do but waiting for him to start the exchanges in g6, so I take this chance to make my b pawn a yet greater threat by following the principle "Rocks belong behind passed pawns".} 25. Ng6 {Showtime... he begins his mating plan. There's 2 ways to deflect his plans. One is passive, moving my rock to f7 to get her off knight's range, waiting him to capture my knight and recapturing with my other knight, but then I leave myself open to possible sacrifices on his side with his h knight to weaken up my already weak castle position, which probably will become real nasty once he takes his rocks to h3 or g3. No, there's a safer way to neutralize the attack. I must capture the knight.} Nxg6 {So I capture the knight. My calculations say he will recapture with queen, no check, no threats on any other of my hanging pieces, so I'll have a free time to bring my d-knight to f8 again. Making unprofitable his playing Nf6+, coz after I play Kh8, both his queen and knight will be en-prise, there is no more a mating chance in h7, and he'd have to retract his queen, losing the knight.} 26. Qxg6 {He captures the knight. He's one move away from mating me (well, 2. but since 1 is a check (Nf6+), it's a forced variation, so I use to view them as a single move).} Nf8 {And by playing this I both challenge his queen, and avoid mate in h7. He must retreat.} 27. Qg3 {So he does.} b3 {I get my pawn one square closer to promotion.} 28. Nf6+ {He plays Nf6+. I think he was expecting me to play Kf7, so in a distraction, I'd fail to Nf5, Qxf7+, Qxh6. But well, there's only a move that will get me rid of his stubborn siege while also unpinning my g pawn to put his knight en-prise, Kh8.} Kh8 {So I play Kh8. Now, his knight is en-prise.} 29. Nh5 {He retreats.} b2 {My pawn is now a serious threat that must be dealt with.} 30. Rab1 {He now has to stop my pawn. He does so with his a-rock.} Qxa4 {I take the free pawn and challenge his d-pawn.} 31. Qc3 {He defends d-pawn and attacks my passed pawn.} Qb4 {I defend my pawn and threat him with queen's exchange.} 32. Qe3 {Of course he won't have it. He can't afford fighting this position with no queen. He retracts her to a place where he defends his d-pawn.} Reb7 {I reinforce the passed pawn.} 33. Nf4 {He must now use his knight to deal with my passed pawn, ideally for him by forking it and my queen with Nd3.} Qb3 {I prevent the fork and challenge his Queen.} 34. Nd3 {He challenges my pawn and prevents queen's exchange.} Qc3 {I play Qc3 with the idea of playing Rb3 and ganging up against the pinned knight.} 35. h4 {I don't see how h4 helps here. But that's what he played. My guesses were he would try to send all his castle to open my king's position and start some major threat there.} Rb7b3 {I play Rb3, his knight is now en-prise.} 36. Rfd1 {He defends it.} Qc2 {I play Qc2, with the idea of playing Qxd1 right after. If he is stubborn about not exchanging his queen, he'll have to lose both rocks instead.} 37. f3 {He plays f3... He failed to properly keep me from exchanging my queen and passed pawn for both of his rocks.} Qxd1+ {I do the exchange... My passed pawn was under too much pressure anyways, I'd lose the chance to do bigger things if I just backed him up all I could, and he'd end up winning it. Better do something to remove more pieces in the game and leaving myself a better position. His king is very far from being safe, so, once I've dealt with his rocks, I'll stand a better chance.} 38. Rxd1 {Recaptures...} b1=Q {I promote to queen.} 39. Rxb1 {He captures.} Rb3xb1+ {I recapture with check and material advantage, for two rocks are worth more than 1 queen in material terms.} 40. Kf2 {He moves his king to f2, trying to lure me to move one of my rocks to check him at b2. I'm not falling for it of course.} Rb1b3 {Instead, I pin his knight.} 41. g4 {He needs to distroy whatever defense is left in my castle.} fxg4 {I capture.} 42. fxg4 {He recaptures.} Ra3 {I play Ra3 to have flexibility to play Ra2+ or R8b3.} 43. g5 {He wants to go for all.} Ra2+ {Check.} 44. Kg3 {Moves his king to g3... Moving him to the first rank would force him to deal with yet greater threats given my rock's position.} hxg5 {I ensure my last stand doesn't get disrupted.} 45. Qxg5 {He captures with Queen, to make her space to check me at h5.} Rb3 {I absolutely pin the undefended knight.} 46. Qh5+ {Check!} Kg8 {And that's the end of his checking. No more checks available once I take my king to g8.} 47. Qd1 {He has to defend his pawn and attack my rock at the same time.} Raa3 {I just prepare to take the knight for free. His king is too far to help. Besides, both his king and queen are in the line of fire... He must move his king if he wants to lose his knight only.} 48. h5 {h5... he totally ignored my coming royal fork.} Rbxd3+ {Fork!} 49. Qxd3 {Has to capture or lose the queen to nothing.} Rxd3+ {Recapture. Material advantage of 8. Positional advantage also will let me promote d-pawn effortlessly (By playing Rxd4, Re4, Nd7, Rxe5, d4, d3, d2, d1=Q). He won't endure 15 more moves. So, he resigns.}
