1. e4 {Sneaky!  In a mini where I'm getting thumped I enjoyed this win, especially against a higher rating.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {Yes, its that opening from me again.} h6 4. d4 Bg4 5. dxe5 Bxf3 6. Qxf3 Qe7 7. exd6 cxd6 8. Be3 Nf6 9. Nc3 {Just developing, no real plan as of yet.} Nc6 10. O-O-O O-O-O 11. Bb5 Ne5 12. Qe2 a6 13. Bd3 {Time and again I've seen Bxp to open up the king, I'm not that brave.} d5 14. exd5 Nxd5 15. Bf5+ Nd7 {Not sure whether thats a mistake or the previous move, it seems to be abandoning the knight, but what other choices were there...} 16. Nxd5 Qe8 17. Qc4+ {That was the start of where I was planning. I figured even if it didn't pay off I'd be a knight and bishop to the good.} Kb8 {K-d5 doesn't work, at most it prolongs it. So pretty much forced.} 18. Qc7+ Ka8 19. Nb6+ {If KxK then RxR forking k&Q, the only other option is k-h7, which gains me the knight I mentioned before.... KxK, forcing the king back to h8.} Nxb6 20. Rxd8+ {He chooses this way which is effectively a forced mate.} Qxd8 {King could have gone to h7, but then RxQ and he is always going to be struggling after that.} 21. Qxd8+ Ka7 22. Bxb6# {One of the few games in this mini I've enjoyed!}
