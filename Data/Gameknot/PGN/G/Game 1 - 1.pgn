1. e4 {This was my first team game and as such I was really motivated. I played a promising queen sacrifice and was a bit lucky to outplay my opponent in the arising complications. Comments/criticism always welcome and thank you for going through the game.} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Qc7 5. Nc3 e6 6. Ndb5 Qb8 7. Be3 Nf6 {After 7...a6 there's an interesting variation starting with 8.Bb6! axb5 9.Nxb5, where black can choose to give up his queen after 9...Bb4+ 10.c3 Ba5 11.Nc7+ Qxc7 12.Bxc7 Bxc7.  I think 8.Bb6 was introduced in Ponomariov-Al Modiahki 1-0, Las Vegas 1999 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1009974), another example is Kurnosov-Ivanisevic 1-0, Istanbul 2003 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1263206)  Black can of course choose 11...Kf8 in lieu of 11...Qxc7, like in Ponomariov-Ivanisevic 1-0, Batumi 1999 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1345209)} 8. f4 d6 9. Qf3 Nb4 {(?!) Sailing into uncharted waters. Intuitively, this should be a dubious move and a waste of time, since white is going to castle queenside anyway. Moves like 9...a6 or 9...Be7 would certainly have been preferable.} 10. O-O-O e5 11. fxe5 {Accepting the challenge, since 11...Bg4 was an obvious threat. But here I have already envisioned the queen sacrifice I followed up this move with.  11.f5 would have been an alternative, though there's an unforced line there, which is just as wild as in the game: 11...a6 12.Na3 b5 13.g4 h5! 14.g5 Ng4 15.Bg1 Be7 16.f6 gxf6 17.h3 fxg5 18.hxg4 Bxg4 19.Qxg4! hxg4 20.Rh8+ Bf8. Safer would be 13.Be2 Bb7 (threatening Nxa2+ and Bxe4 if 14.g4) 14.Rhg1, followed by 15.g4.} Bg4 12. exf6 {(!?) Well, no sense in backing out now, right? Of course 12.Qf2 (threatening Bxa7, 12...Bxd1? 13.gxf6) was completely safe and probably better. As one might learn from my games I often fall for the temptation of such speculative sacrifices.} Bxf3 {Black has to accept the sacrifice.} 13. fxg7 {Zwischenzug #1. White is in no hurry to recapture the bishop, but instead makes an in-between move that deflects the bishop from guarding the d6-pawn. Black's response is once again forced, since 13...Bxd1? 14.gxh8=Q is out of the question.} Bxg7 14. Nxd6+ {Zwischenzug #2. Grabbing another pawn.} Ke7 {(?) Black goes wrong here. 14...Kf8 was much better. After 15.gxf3 Bxc3! 16.bxc3 Nc6 17.Nf5 Rg8 18.Bc5+ Ke8 19.Nd6+ Kf8 20.Nxf7! Kxf7 21.Bc4+ Ke8 22.Bxg8 an interesting positon arises, where after 22...Qe5 black has a good chance of holding the position. If white tries 23.Rhg1, black has 23...Qxc5! 24.Rg8+ Ke7 25.Rxa8 Nd4! 26.Rxd4 Qxd4 where white can hardly avoid the perpetual check Qe1-b4.} 15. Nf5+ {After black's mistake in the previous move, white has another in-between move, attacking the bishop on g7 and freeing the a3-f8 diagonal for his own on e3.} Kf8 16. gxf3 {I chose it was finally time to recapture. However, another in-between check, 16.Bc5+, was even better. After 16...Kg8 17.Ne7+ Kf8 and only now 18.gxf3 black is in even more trouble. White threatens a deadly discovered check and if 18...Ke8 19.Bb5+ finishes it off. 18...Nxa2+ (the piece is lost anyway, might as well give it up for as much as you can) 19.Nxa2 Qf4+ 20.Kb1 Qc7 21.Bb4 is also hopeless.} Bxc3 {(?) Another mistake. The threat of Bc5+ had to be dealt with, either with 16...Qc7 or 16...b6 and, although white is better, black can still hope. After the text move, black is lost.} 17. Bc5+ {Finally.} Ke8 18. bxc3 {Because of the threat of 19.Ng7 mate black can't save the knight.} Qf4+ 19. Kb1 Rg8 20. cxb4 {Threatening 21.Bb5 mate. Black has only one move.} a6 21. Bc4 {Eyeing the f7-pawn in combination with a possible Nd6+ and connecting the rooks.} Rd8 {Speeding up defeat in what was already a hopeless position.} 22. Rxd8+ Kxd8 23. Rd1+ Kc8 24. Ne7+ {And black resigns because of 24...Kb8 25.Bd6+ (the easiest). A really nice way to win my first team game.}
