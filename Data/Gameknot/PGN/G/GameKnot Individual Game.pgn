1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 h6 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 Be7 {Fairly tame opening in which each side has positioned itself.} 6. Nc3 O-O 7. Be3 {White "completes"  his initial development.} c6 {Black prepares for a pawn onslaught.} 8. d4 exd4 9. Bxd4 a5 {Enhances the forthcoming Black onslaught.} 10. Re1 b5 11. Bd3 c5 12. Be3 c4 13. Be2 {Black's queenside pawns are rolling down the board.} b4 {Winning a pawn?} 14. e5 bxc3 15. exf6 Bxf6 16. Bxc4 cxb2 {So it does appear.} 17. Rb1 Bc3 18. Bd2 Bxd2 {Perhaps Qc7 would have been better.} 19. Qxd2 Qb6 20. Qc3 Qd8 {Black concedes the return of material equality.} 21. Rxb2 Be6 {I am not sure of the intention or purpose behind this move.} 22. Bxe6 fxe6 23. Rxe6 {And now it is Black who is down a pawn.} Qd7 24. Re1 Nc6 25. Rd1 Nb4 {An aggressive Knight but one that is easily repulsed.} 26. a3 Rac8 {A Knight withdrawal may have been more prudent.} 27. Qb3+ {The check was probably unexpected.  (Why don't I ever receive unexpected checks in the mail??  I could certainly use the money.)  Black's b4 Knight is now toast.} Kh8 28. axb4 axb4 29. Qxb4 d5 30. Qd4 Rcd8 {Black does not want to give up the d file pawn for nothing.} 31. Ne5 Qf5 {Schucks, I really wanted to throw a fork!!} 32. Rf1 {This gives f2 extra defense - and besides I did not think the Rook was helping me all that much on d1.} Rf6 {Interesting.  I already begin thinking about Ng4.} 33. h3 Re8 {Ganging up on my Knight - but as already indicated it has a place to go.} 34. Ng4 Re4 {A mistake.  At a minimum I should win the exchange.  The attack on the Queen does not buy time for the f6 Rook to move.  When you launch an assault against an enemy Queen it really should gain something - time, material, position, or some combination thereof.} 35. Rb8+ {Another unexpected (most likely) check!!} Kh7 {And I now have time to capture the f6 Rook.} 36. Nxf6+ gxf6 {Although this maintains the d file pawn it allows the following continuation.} 37. Qa7+ {I saw this position after Black's 34th move.} Kg6 38. Rg8+ Kh5 {Finally, I get to throw a fork!!} 39. g4+ Rxg4+ 40. hxg4+ {One good fork deserves another.} Qxg4+ 41. Rxg4 Kxg4 42. Qd4+ {I really expected Black to resign at this point.} Kg5 43. Qxd5+ Kg6 44. Kh2 f5 45. Rg1+ Kf6 46. f4 {Allows Qe5  and limits Black's available moves.} Ke7 47. Rg6 h5 48. Qb7+ {And Black must withdraw to the 8th rank.} Kf8 49. Qh7 {And mate next.} h4 {Still no resignation!} 50. Rg8# {So checkmate.}
