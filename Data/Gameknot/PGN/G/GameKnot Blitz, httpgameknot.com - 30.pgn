[Opening "King's Indian (E97), orthodox, Aronin-Taimanov, bayonet attack"]

1. d4 {I usually do not annotate Blitz games, but this is an exception. It shows why I play the KID (King's Indian Defence) as Black against d4, if possible.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 {This is the main line. Now White has various options.} 9. Nd2 {And Nd2 is one of the most popular ones. White's plan is to expand on the queenside, while I try to attack on the kingside.} Ne8 {This is still theory. I move the knight away, so I can play the typical central break f5.} 10. f3 {And White knows this, so he over-protects the e4-pawn.} f5 {The break.} 11. Rb1 {White prepares for pushing the queenside pawns.} Nf6 {Adding pressure on e4. Moving the knight back and forth is not as bad as it would be in open positions. Here it is more important to get to play f5.} 12. b4 {Continuing the plan. This prepares for c5.} f4 {I close the center. I surrender the fight for the center to turn my attention to White's king.} 13. Qc2 {I think White is a bit too slow here. Direct c5 is what I would do.} g5 {The attack begins.} 14. c5 {White plays the expected move.} Ng6 {The knight is a more useful piece in the attack, so it occupies a better square.} 15. Nc4 {This is logical. White adds pressure to d6, which is the base of the pawn chain after the exchange of pawns on d6.} Rf7 {The purpose of this move might not be obvious at first. It protects the c7-square, which will be important for White, if he wishes to penetrate the position. In addition, it frees the f8-square for other pieces and allows the rook to join the attack if it is needed on the g- of h-files.} 16. a4 {This is unnecessary, I think. I would exchange the pawns now with cxd6.} Bf8 {The bishop has no future on the long diagonal, because the center is closed, so it helps in defence by over-protecting the important d6-square.} 17. cxd6 {Now White exchanges.} cxd6 18. b5 {I think this is a mistake. The b5-square belongs to the other knight in my opinion. There is no hope breaking through with pawns only.} h5 {Preparing g4. Computers often fail to understand this kind of positions and think that my king is in danger.} 19. a5 {What else?} g4 {And I continue my plan.} 20. b6 {This locks the queenside.} a6 {Now the a- and b-pawns stay where they are.} 21. Ba3 {Pressuring the d6-pawns. I am happy I already have it protected.} Nh7 {This knight is going to g5.} 22. Nd1 {And this one? I do not know.} g3 {The f2 square is mine now.} 23. h3 {Is this defence adequate?} Bxh3 {No! Give this position to a chess engine, and see what it says. This is so typical in the KID that it is almost automatic.} 24. gxh3 {Accepting the sacrifice.} Qd7 {(!) After this quiet move, White is suddenly in a big trouble.} 25. Bd3 {This is natural. White opens the second row for the queen, so that it can help in defence.   Defending the h3-pawn with 25. Kg2 leads to 25...Nh4+ 26. Kg1 Qxh3 27. Bd3 Ng5 and White is helpless; for example 28. Qe2 g2 29. Nde3  (29. Re1 Qh1+ 30. Kf2 Nh3# or 29. Kf2 Qg3+ 30. Kg1 Nh3#) Rg7 30. Nf5 gxf1Q+ 31. Qxf1 Ngxf3+ 32. Kf2 Qh2+ 33. Qg2 Qxg2#. I did not have to calculate all the variations before I sacrificed the bishop. My intuition told me this was winning already. This combination of moves Nh4, Ng5, Qxh3, and g2 is repeated in many variations, and that is what I saw.  Other defences still leave Black with the advantage. For example, 25. Ndb2 Nh4 26. Bd3 Ng5 and winning similarly, for example 27. Qe2 Qxh3 28. Nxd6 g2 29. Nxf7 Kxf7 30. d6 Qg3 with a checkmate to follow with Nh3#.  Perhaps the best defence is giving back some material with 25. Nf2!? and then not 25...gxf2+ 26. Kxf2 Qxh3 27. Ke1 and White's king is safe and he will probably counterattack on the kingside with equal chances. Correct is to refuse the defensive sacrifice with 25...Ng5! (or 25...Nh4! the move order is not that critical) 26. Rfd1 Nh4 27. Rb3 (27. Rd3 gxf2+ 28. Kxf2 Qxh3 29. Ke1 Nhxf3+ 30. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 31. Rxf3 Qxf3 32. Rb3 Qh1+ 33. Kd2 f3 34. Ne3 Bh6 and eventually the passed pawn costs White material) Rg7 28. Bf1 (28. Ng4 Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 hxg4 30. fxg4 Rxg4 winning or 28. Nxd6 gxf2+ 29. Kxf2 Qxh3 30. Ke1 Nhxf3+ 31. Bxf3 Nxf3+ 32. Rxf3 Qxf3 with a winnign attack) Ngxf3+ 29. Rxf3 Nxf3+ 30. Kg2 Nh4+ 31. Kg1 and Black can win in many ways, coolest being just slowly improving the position before taking back the material with 31...Rc8.} Ng5 {After this move White resigns, nominally ahead in material with a bishop for a pawn. But the threats are the same as given in the annotation after the previous move: Nh4, Qxh3 and then either checkmate or advancing the passed pawn. For example: 26. Nxd6 Bxd6 27. Bxd6 Nh4! 28. Qe2 (or 28. Rb2 Qxh3 29. Qe2 Rg7 30. Bxe5 g2! 31. Bxg7 Nhxf3+ 32. Qxf3 Nxf3+ 33. Kf2 Qg3+ 34. Ke2 gxf1Q+ winning) Nxh3+ 29. Kh1 g2+ 30. Qxg2+ Nxg2 31. Bxe5 Ng5 and Black wins.  I emphasize that I did not calculate all the variations during the game, but trusted in my intuition and experience from similar positions.}
