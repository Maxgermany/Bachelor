1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nxe4 4. Qe2 Qe7 {This is where things start to go bad. I should have played 3. ... d6 followed by 4. ... Nxe4} 5. Qxe4 d6 6. d4 Nc6 7. Bb5 dxe5 8. Bxc6+ {White has a pretty good attack starting. Right now I decided I needed to write the knight off as bad debt and try to play a strong game.} Bd7 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 10. Qxe5+ Be7 11. O-O O-O-O {Might as well have an interesting game ! I'm down a knight and a pawn but who says I can't give a good fight?} 12. Be3 Bd6 13. Qa5 a6 {The queen cannot be allowed on a7.} 14. Nd2 Qg4 15. g3 {In my opinion, white should have continued the attack on black's queen side or fortified his king side. } h5 {I need to press on the attack if I want to not die in the end game.} 16. Nc4 h4 {Focusing my forces on the king.} 17. Nxd6+ {This is actually not bad for me, that bishop was important in the attack but he is replaced by my rook.} Rxd6 18. Qe5 hxg3 19. Qxg3 {?? This leaves a hole in white's king side. Not sure why he made this move.} Qh5 {White needs to get very creative to survive. I am threatening Rg6. The threats I have on the table are a checkmate with Rg6 and Qf3, and a checkmate with Qxh2.} 20. c3 Rg6 21. Bf4 {?? Missing the finishing move.} Qxh2# {It was a good game. Sometime you just need to keep fighting and persevere. A game isn't won until it's won. With that said, I have thrown away plenty of winning positions.}
