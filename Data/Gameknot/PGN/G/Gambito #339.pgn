1. e4 c5 {This game features a nice attack with my favorite variation of the Sicilian Najdorf. I never have any problems playing Sicilian as Black, and I've upset a lot of high rated players with Sicilian. I quit playing e4 a long time ago when I couldn't find any good openings against Sicilian. This is only my theory, and you can disagree, but Sicilian is just good for Black, if Black plays completely accurately. Excuse my bold statement about this position being winning for Black, but I am very serious about my Sicilian. Although the opening only matters if both sides play 100% accurately throughout the game, which no players will, so you can play whatever opening you want if you're not a grandmaster, but if you're looking for a sharp opening against e4 that you'll never want to quit playing, then I advise you to go over this game and learn to play Sicilian the way I do, I explain a lot of my sicilian repertoire throughout this annotation.} 2. Nf3 {Against moves like this that don't reveal White's plans, I recommend the standard 2...d6 adding control to the central dark squares. White has committal moves like f4 and c3, where Black needs to play differently than he would against the non-comittal moves. Against 2.f4, Black should play 2...g6 immediately and develop like Dragon, since playing in the center will allow White's f4 to have a purpose. Against Dragon setups, f4's only purpose is to play f5 attacking g6, which isn't anything to be afraid of, and is why f4 isn't advisable against Dragon. Black can develop and castle quickly in the dragon setup, and take advantage of the f4 weakness later. Against another comittal move 2.c3, I recommend the most common response 2...Nf6, since White has blocked his own knight from developing to c3, Black's knight on f6 will be stronger when White cannot control the same squares with Nc3 anymore, so White almost always plays 3.e5, and after Nd5 d4 cxd4 Nf3 Nc6, Black's play will pretty much all be on the queenside, where he has both knights there, and lots of flexibility, and it will take White awhile to develop play on the kingside, while his pawns are slightly overextended. } d6 {I think this is sharper than the other common moves. 2...Nc6 takes away the option of developing the knight to d7, 2...g6 commits to fianchettoing the bishop too early, and 2...e6 blocks in the bishop and the only points I see to 2...e6 are to block the g8-a2 diagonal and prepare for a d5 boost. Black can block that diagonal with e6 anytime, and early d5 is not necessary in the Sicilian, so to me 2...d6 is the only logical move, and Black will wait to see how White responds to decide what kind of setup to play. The lines after 3.Bb5  Bd7 Bxd7 Qxd7, tend to be somewhat equal, but with a slight advantage for Black.} 3. d4 {White decides that the only chance to fight for advantage is to take away Black's control of d4, while opening up the position with a lead in development, but Open Sicilian to me is easier to play against than the annoying anti-sicilians where the plans are unclear. Against lines where White delays or doesn't play d4, then Black has many ways of getting an at least equal position, usually with a slight advantage. Against early Bc4, Black can develop normally with e6 a6 Nf6 Be7, and because of e6 and a6, the bishop is useless on that diagonal, Black can continue development Nc6 Bd7 and his position is completely solid with queenside expansion ideas. Against non-committal moves like Nc3, Black can just play Nf6 and White will almost have to play a committal move like d4 and go into mainline. If White plays passively, then Black should go into a Dragon setup and have an advantage. Dragon is only bad when played against a 100% accurate Open Sicilian, but not against passive play by White. If you don't know dragon well and don't want to study it, then e5 is playable in some lines.} cxd4 {Qxd4 is a sideline here, but it is nothing to be afraid of. Black can simply play a6 stopping Bb5 and then Nc6 attacking the queen with tempo. Black can play a dragon setup, which is good against almost any passive play by White. } 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Black usually wants to play e5, but if e5 immediately then Bb5  then Nf5 is annoying. Black should catch up in development and control the b5 square before playing agressively} 5. Nc3 {White has passive moves like Bd3 or f3, where White doesn't want Nc3 so he can play c4 and go into a Maroczy Bind. Against the passive moves that defend the e-pawn, Black could just go ahead and play e5 to exploit White's passive play, since the Bb5  Nf5 moves are not effective when Black can play the d5 boost with a strong center.} a6 {This is the key position of the Sicilian Najdorf, and where White has a lot of options. Against Sozin Attack 6.Bc4, Black should play e6 blocking the diagonal, and White usually plays Bb3 to stop b5-b4 winning a pawn. Black gets a solid comfortable position after developing Be7 Bd7 Nc6 and the f6-knight can retreat to e8 if it ever gets harassed by g4-g5. Against the agressive 6.Bg5, Black needs to play slightly defensively and develop e6 Nbd7 Qc7 b5 Bb7 to solidify everything and make sure White cannot penetrate. Black needs to be aware of potential sacrifices in that line, such as Nf4 enticing exf5 opening the e-file before Black castles, and Nxb5 sacrifices that leave the queenside wide open. There are a lot of cheap sacrifices in the 6.Bg5 line that Black needs to foresee, but if you develop like I said, then Black catches up in development, and White's position is slightly messed up because of the early attacking attempts Against 6.f4, Black should play 6...g6 like dragon, since like i said before, f4 is not good against dragon, and playing in the center with e6 or e5 allows f4 to have a purpose. Against 6.Be2 and other passive moves, Black can play almost anything and be at least equal with moves like e6 or e5. But I recommend g6 against this move also, since dragon setups are good against passive moves, and the way I see it, Black gets the useful a6 move in exchange for White's wasted Be2 move.} 6. Be3 {This is the mainline, and usually a signification that White wants to play f3 (stopping Ng4) Qd2 O-O-O and attack on the kingside. Here White delays f3 so that Ng4 is tempting, but Ng4 isn't good, White can play Bg5 and Black's knight is out of place, or even Bc1 and offer a draw if Black retreats his knight back. The moves against the other varitions like g6 and e6 aren't sharp here. Dragon is not good against a 100% accurate open sicilian, while e6 is too passive and allows moves like g4. The reason e6 is good against moves like Bc4 and Bg5, is because Black needs to play solidly to stop the early cheapos, and can take advantage of White's dubious bishop moves later. Against Be3 and f3, White doesn't have any early cheap shots and is closer to castling queenside, so Black needs to play agressively to prepare for a quick queenside counterattack.} e5 {White's knight has 4 squares to go to, and White usually plays 7.Nb3 preparing to defend where he will castle. 7.Nf4 can be exploited with Bxf4 and then d5, Black gives up the bishop pair to get a strong center, which isn't a problem since White's bishops can't do much, and Black has an extra knight. 7.Nde2 is a rare move, because it blocks the paths of two pieces, and Black can play Ng4 because if bishop retreats, then Qb6. Against 7.Nf3, I recommend Qc7 stopping Bc4, and Black usually gets an advantage if he succeeds in making the d5-pawn break, that can be prepared after b5 Bb7 Nbd7 Nb6 and Rd8 if needed. Black also might want to play Be7 earlier so that he can castle in one move when needed.} 7. Nb3 {The only downside to this move is that Black gets a quicker queenside attack after b5-b4-a5-a4 since a4 will be played with tempo. White could still decide to castle kingside, in which Black can employ the same ideas in the 7.Nf3 variation, where he plays for d5, except now the bishop can be developed Be6 instead of Bb7 since the knight isn't on f3 to harass the bishop with Ng5.} Be6 8. f3 Be7 {Black has the idea of playing for d5 in the passive lines, but should not be done now since Qd2 O-O-O owns the d-file in which the d5 boost would benefit White. Black needs to just castle immediately and wait to see what White does. If White goes for a cheap attack g4, then Black can go ahead with the d5 boost now that he is better developed and ready to castle. Play could continue g4 d5 g5 d4 gxf6 Bxf6 and Bh4  is coming if White doesn't play Bf2, in which dxc3 leaves White with doubled isolated pawns in the endgame} 9. Qd2 O-O {Once again if White plays g4 phish attack attempt, then d5 is good for Black.} 10. O-O-O Nbd7 {b5 is also playable here, but i like to complete development before I start attacking. So far this is still main line, now both sides will pawnstorm toward the others king, and then it's a matter of whose attack is completed first. Black's attack looks more promising, since Black gets 2 tempo moves (b4 and a4) while White only gets 1 tempo move (g5), and the space is already clear for Black's major pieces to dominate the queenside files, while it will take White a little more time to coordinate his pieces on the kingside.} 11. g4 b5 12. g5 b4 {This is sharper than retreating immedeiately. If you are familiar with lines of Calishnikov then you know gxf6 is not advisable because after bxc3 Black's open files to White's king are more dangerous than White's open g-file, since Black can just defend g7 with moves like Ne8 and Bf6, and Black can push the a-pawn} 13. Ne2 Ne8 {The old main line was Nh5, which stalls White's play on the kingside, but modern theory prefers Ne8. Black should get all his pieces coordinated in the attack, rather than trying to stop White's attack. BLack's knights will get good outpost squares and Black's attack is quicker, the way Black's minor pieces are coordinated, they both defend the kingside and prepare to attack on the queenside.} 14. Ng3 {14.Qxb4 is dubious, because once again, Black's open files on the queenside will be of more use than White's open g-file after Bxg5. This is where my book line knowledge dies down, because I am more familiar with the main line h4, in which Black plays a5-a4-a3 and gives White a weakness on the dark squares. I wasn't familiar with this line and wasn't sure if I should be afraid of Nf5. } a5 {After 5.Nf5 a4, White's knight has to retreat to a1 and also a2 hangs and the e7 bishop isn't important at the moment so White pretty much has to play Kb1 so the knight can retreat to c1. White has to defend during the middle of his attack, while Black can just simply attack.} 15. Kb1 Nb6 {15.Nb6? bad move. I lack book knowledge in this line, but I really should've played a4-a3 here, but this move just seemed natural to me. 16.Nf5 is correct book move in this position, and it scores good for White. After a4-a3 White has to respond to the threats and Black's attack gets dangerous while White has yet to pawnstorm and coordinate his pieces toward my king. but luckily White didn't play Nf5 so I maintain the advantage I had since the 1st move.} 16. f4 {I don't really understand this move, despite Nf5 being better, White shouldn't be trying to break up my center, since this is a double-edged attacking position. In lines where White plays f4, exf4 is almost forced since f5 is unpleasant.} a4 17. Nc1 exf4 18. Bxf4 {White's opening the f-file hardly did anything for him. His isolated pawn is much weaker than mine, and he has wasted a lot of movevs. Here I was considering a3 or b3. I wasn't comfortable after a3 because I don't think I'm in a position to take advantage of the dark square weakness, i thought b3 was much sharper, and White might accept the pawn sacrifice, but now that I analyse the game in-depth, I don't think the sacrifice would have worked out very well for me. But luckily White did not accept it.} b3 {The lines where Black plays a3 are more positional, and Black should also have a knight ready to head for c3, I think b3 is sharper and a lot more interesting. Most players familiar with Calishnikov know that accepting this sacrifice isn't good, and Black will mount up an attack on the files White opens after accepting the pawn. Don't be afraid to make this sacrifice, if White accepts it, then just attack whatever he weakens from accepting it and your attack will be annihilating. } 19. cxb3 {It's better to open the c-file rather than the a-file, since the open c-file is not as dangerous, Black's major pieces will flood the a-file if White opens it.} axb3 20. a3 {White declines the sacrifice, which is safer, but I think accepting the sacrifice is White's best chance since now I have enough time to play the long awaited d5-boost, which is the typical freeing break in the Sicilian, and now I have the initiative} d5 {White still has the option of accepting the pawn, but it is not advisable to open files to your king in a double-edged position, even if it seems like Black has hardly any compensation, taking the pawn could be regrettable in the future if Black gets a crushing attack.} 21. Qf2 {Maneuvering the queen to the open f-file while pinning the d-pawn, exd5 next move could be dangerous with the queen on the d-file.} Nd6 {Now my knights will get good outposts thanks to the freeing d5 move, and this blocks the queen from the rook's path. Nbc4 is coming, and then I can build up to sacrifice on a3.} 22. Be3 {This bishop has moved back and forth, while my knights have landed on great outposts.} Nbc4 {White almost has no play on the kingside, and his two pawns won't defend his king for long, since only pawns have been exchanged and White has a lot of pieces out of play, I can sacrifice a knight on a3 to finish the attack. I think Black should've taken the b-pawn earlier since he doesn't have much play on the kingside, and it was the only chance to create an imbalance. Now taking the pawn is pretty much suicidal, since I didn't have the Nxa3 idea before, but White chose the wrong time to take the pawn, because now Nxa3 is crushing.} 23. Nxb3 Nxa3+ {White's only chance is to take the knight and try to defend. Playing like a coward and moving the king just lets me have the attack without losing any material.} 24. bxa3 {After my sacrifice, the b-file has been opened to White's king, so now my rook can take control of the b-file} Rb8 {White needs to save this knight, like I said before, White shouldn't let me equalize the material since then he would have nothing to compensate for his exposed king and inactive pieces. White should now be focused on trying to hold onto as much material as possible. Defending with Rd3 allows dxe4, attacking the rook while attacking the knight again, and after Qc2 dxe4 White cannot defend the knight any longer. Against Ka2, I can play d4 attacking the knight and bishop, and I can continue the attack while recovering some material. So I think Kc2 is pretty much the only move. If White tries exd5 then Rxb3 Kc2 Qb8 with crushing attack, or exd5 Rxb3 Kc1 Qa5! and White's king is surrounded by the major pieces. If exd5 Rxb3 Ka2, then I can play Rxa3 and if Kxa3 then Ne4   } 25. Kc2 Rxb3 {Sacrificing more material to open up the king is okay when your opponent's pieces are out of play. I learned that from (bakerbaker) who has many attacking games annotated on gameknot. It was actually him who taught me his Sicilian repertoire and his theories behind it. I agreed with all his theories and he has taught me a lot of attacking strategies in the lines of our Sicilian repertoire} 26. Kxb3 {White's king is very exposed against my active pieces, which are just ready to attack the helpless king. I analysed this variation when I first played Nxa3 and was planning to play Qb8 , but now I saw Qa5 which might be better than my intended Qb8 . I couldn't decide between Qb8  or Qa5, so I decided to keep both queen moves options, while increasing the pressure around the king} Nxe4 {This knight doesn't really have anywhere to go to, while it's still contraversial where my queen should go, and this also frees up space for my dark bishop. White needs to make an important decision here, whether to remove my knight controlling squares near White's king, or to move the queen to help defend. I think it's better just to remove the knight, since Qb8  will be deadly if the knight is left alone and has the potential to attack.} 27. Nxe4 {Trade passive pieces for active ones} dxe4+ {White should save his rook so that I don't catch up in material, so White can play either Kc2 or Bc4.} 28. Bc4 {Kc2 is too passive, and White's king is too vulnerable to all my tempo checks. Bc4 offers to trade an inactive piece for an active one, even with White's king on c4, I think I'm probably still winning, but the attack will be harder to carry out without my light bishop, so I should increase the pressure of my attack.} Qa5 {I have some major tempo threats now. Qxa3 , Rb8 , and Qb5  all continue the attack with tempo, so White needs to see which threat is the most dangerous, and if there is any way to defend. I think no matter how I continue the attack, as long as I have tempo, I should be able to mate or recover more than enough material.} 29. Bxe6 {White cannot stop all my tempo checks, so he trades while giving the king more breathing space. But now I can exploit my awesomely placed queen.} Qxa3+ 30. Kc2 {logically White's king will be in less danger when it is not in the center, but it doesn't matter how White continues, my queen just dominates the entire queenside.} fxe6 {Rc8  will have devestating consequences now that the bishop isn't controlling anymore, so White's only chance is to sacrifice the inactive queen for my rook that is ready to attack, but that lets me catch up in material.} 31. Qxf8+ Bxf8 {Here I have a queen and two pawns for two rooks, and my pawn on e4 is very strong compared to the other pawns on the board. The two rooks are often stronger than the queen in wide open positions where the rooks are coordinated and have other pieces aiding them, but here the rooks are not in any position to attack, and the rooks are horrible defenders. White would probably prefer to have a queen than the 2 rooks, since the queen would be a much better defender to oppose my queen.} 32. Bc1 {My queen and bishop and pawn will reach full potential and complete the attack, despite the lack of attackers. White's king wouldv'e been much more vulnerable on c4 since I'd be threatening Qb4#, and if Bd2 in the position where White's king is on c4, then I'll have Qd3#} Qa4+ {33.Kd2 will lead to mate after 33...Qb3 (threatening Bb4  Ke2 Qf3#) If 34.Ke1 then Bb4  35.Bd2 (try to find the other mates against other moves) 35...Qe3  36.Kf1 Qf3  37.Kg1 Bc5  or 37.Ke1 Qxh1  38...Qf3  39.Ke1 e3!! unstoppable mate} 33. Kb1 {33.Kc3 loses to Bb4  Kb2 (if Kd4 then Be1  and Qxd1) Qa3  Kb1 Qb3  Ka1 Bc3  33.Kb2 loses to Bd6! and the bishop is invicible since the rook will be forked if it takes, and then the threat of Be5  is dangerous with the followup of more tempo checks. Here I was worried that after Kb1 there wasn't enough material left on the board to complete the attack, but since White's rooks are horrible defenders, I can make them useless and it's almost like I'm up an entire queen.} Qb3+ {I will play e3 next move, stopping the Rd2 defense, } 34. Bb2 {After Ka1 e3, the rooks fail to defend, since disconnecting the rooks often allows rook-forking tactics. Either my pawn will advance to e2 and cause severe annoyance to the rooks, making it so that they cannot interfere with my bishop's completion of the attack on the h8-a1 diagonal, or I will win a disconnected rook.} Ba3 35. Rd2 {checking will give White a temporary sense of power, but it really just lets my king get a free move.} e3 {Pretty much any rook move reaches the same doom. When there are material imbalances, you must use your imbalance to the fullest potential, and two rooks for a queen is not a good imbalance when the rooks are defending. 2 rooks tend to be a very strong attacking combo, while they are useless defenders.} 36. Rc2 Bxb2 37. Rxb2 Qd3+ {The queen dominates the rooks, while the pawn is close to promotion, so it's pretty much over now. If Ka2 then Qd5  forks. If Kc1 then e2 and the king is badly placed, it stops the rooks from defending the promotion square, and allows the Qc3  tempo idea controlling the promotiong square, not to mention the king is more exposed to rook forks. Rc2 is also bad because of Qe4 threatening the rook, and there's the Qb4  idea that threatens the promotion square with tempo, so after e2 White really can't stop the promotion tactic, or he'll lose a rook.} 38. Ka1 {White decides his king should be furthest from the action, but my pawn is too strong, White cannot save this position.} e2 {Now Qc3 is an idea against passive moves, threatening promotion while pinning the rook. I can employ that idea after Rhb1 Qa3  Ra2 Qc3  and I promote.} 39. Re1 {After this I don't see a way to force promotion since my pawn is under attack twice. I'll have to lose the pawn and win with my pawn majority, but since White's rooks are terribly placed and not good attackers, this should still be an easy win.} Qd1+ {what else?} 40. Rb1 Qd4+ {If Rb2 then Qa4  allows Qd1 and both rooks cannot defend the back rank anymore.} 41. Ka2 Qd2+ {I was starting to get into time pressure here, so I should just win White's pawns since his rooks are helpless defenders, and shouldn't be able to interfere since disconnecting rooks usually allows a forking tactic.} 42. Ka3 Qa5+ {This is better than taking immediately, since the king is forced to the b-file, now the rook cannot take pawn next move because of Qb5 } 43. Kb3 {The next several moves were made pretty fast, all I need to do is win White's last pawns and promote, this will be easy since White's king is far} Qxg5 44. Kc2 Qe5 {White could try to defend this pawn, which is probably his last chance, but I will probably win this pawn eventually, and white probably wanted to get my advanced pawn off the board as soon as possible, but Rh1 was probably the best chance.} 45. Kd2 Qxh2 46. Rxe2 Qd6+ {A queen and three pawns should always be winning against 2 rooks, even a queen and two pawns is usually enough to win, but sometimes a draw if the pawns are not connected, but since I have conntected g and h-pawns, the game is basically over.} 47. Kc3 h5 48. Rbe1 h4 {Forget the non-connected pawn, I just want to promote as soon as possible} 49. Re2xe6 Qc7+ 50. Kd4 h3 51. Re6e8+ Kh7 52. Re8e2 h2 {There shouldn't be much hope for White now, once my other pawn advances, White's rooks won't be able to defend anymore} 53. Rh1 Qf4+ 54. Re4 {Only move that doesn't allow a forking tactic that wins a rook} Qd6+ 55. Kc4 {This is the safest square to avoid forks} g5 {connecting the rooks avoids forks, but moving the rook off the 4th rank allows me to push my pawn without problems. I am going to play Qg3 and g4, then Qh3 and g3 etc. white's rooks do not stand a chance.} 56. Rhe1 {white thought this was his last chance to get activity, but since only 1 rook is defending the promotion square, I can try to get my queen to g1 force promotion} Qc6+ {Kd4 or King to b-file allows Qb6  followed by Qg1 and white's rooks can't check for long.} 57. Kd3 Qd7+ {My queen will get to h3, and then there's nothing stopping the pawns} 58. Kc4 Qh3 {g4-g3-g2 is coming, so all White can do is check} 59. Re4e7+ Kg6 60. Re1e6+ Kf5 61. Re6e5+ Kf6 {White resigned here since I'm going to get another queen. If White moves a rook to e6, then I can just simply trade the queen for both rooks and promote next move}
