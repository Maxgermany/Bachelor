[Opening "King's Indian (E80), Saemisch variation"]

1. d4 {Still very bored so I figure I'll do a thematic tourney game with one of my favorite openings.  The Samisch King's Indian.  Most of the horrid blunder belong to black but I make some to let black keep playing.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f3 Nfd7 {Strange move right off 5... e5 or 5... O-O followed by 6... c4 (my recommended line for black)} 6. Nge2 {Nge2 is flexable and attempts to play Ng3 when I get the chance.  I prefer this move first to Be3 though they lead to the same most of the time.} c5 7. d5 O-O 8. Be3 Ne5 9. Ng3 Bd7 10. Qd2 {White has a noticeable lead in development here but since the structure is largely closed there is not big advantage to this.} f5 {The thematic break of the KID.  Though one cant help but wonder if it's best here.} 11. O-O-O Qa5 12. h4 {Now that my piece are mostly developed and my lsb really doesn't have any good squares... I begin my attack.} Be8 13. h5 Nbd7 {Black catches up in development, but white is starting an attack.} 14. Bh6 Qb4 15. hxg6 Bxg6 {Black's Choice is to take back with the bishop which can have it's up puts more pressure on e4 which is well defend.} 16. exf5 Rxf5 {? on this move why give up a rook for a knight... Positionally this isn't a sound sac...} 17. Nxf5 Bxf5 18. Bxg7 Kxg7 {Black's king is now totally exposed :)!} 19. Qg5+ {Now begins the onslaught.} Bg6 20. Qxe7+ Kh8 21. f4 {Because of black's exposed king I now get to cash in.} Re8 22. Qg5 Rg8 {Black must give up one piece he choices the knight.} 23. fxe5 dxe5 {Black has the tactical try 23... Bd2 but fails to gain any material after 24. Qe7} 24. Qe3 Rg7 25. Bd3 Bf7 26. Qh3 Bg8 27. g4 Nf6 28. Rdf1 Qb6 29. g5 Rxg5 {Interesting to note the rook sac 30. Rxf6! Qxf6 31. Bxh7 here not sure why I didn't see it.} 30. Bxh7 Nxh7 31. Rf8 {Black's all pinned up though I sacrificed some material.  Still winning though not the best line.} Qg6 32. Rd8 Rg1+ 33. Rxg1 Qxg1+ 34. Kc2 Qg6+ 35. Qd3 Qg2+ 36. Kb3 Qg5 37. Re8 a6 38. d6 Nf6 {Nf6 doesn't quite stop the pawn...  Though I think it takes a few moves to stop this pawn.  Black would to have foreseen this pawn march.} 39. d7 Nxd7 40. Qxd7 b5 41. Rxg8+ {Strange time for another sac I was worried about all the pawns near my king I wanted to do something about them but the bishop on g8 was pinning my c4 pawn.} Kxg8 42. Qd5+ Kf8 43. Qxc5+ Ke8 44. cxb5 Qg8+ 45. Qc4 Qg7 46. bxa6 e4 {I missed a great opportunity to finish this quickly.  Qc8+ Kf7 Qc7+ forcing a trade of queens.} 47. Qe6+ Kd8 48. Qxe4 {My only concern at this point is to stop checks.} Qf6 49. Qd5+ Kc7 {Kc7 allows me to stop the potential checks.} 50. Nb5+ Kc8 51. Na7+ {Pushes the king to c7} Kc7 52. Qb7+ {Now the king must move to d8 too not lose the queen.} Kd8 53. Nc6+ {Nc6+ ends all counter play.} Ke8 54. Qe7+ {Black resigns white will queen on a8 and win easily.}
