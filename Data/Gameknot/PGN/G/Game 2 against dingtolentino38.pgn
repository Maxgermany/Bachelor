[Opening "KP (C20), Mengarini's opening"]

1. e4 e5 2. a3 {Mengarini's Opening.} Nf6 {I enjoy playing this as White or Black.} 3. d3 Bc5 {As you may be able to tell, I love sacks on f7/f2!} 4. Bg5 {This only lets me regain material on move 5. Can you see why?} d5 {This isn't the reason and I probably could have gone without this move. } 5. exd5 {On this next move the reason Bg5 should not have been played is made apparent.} Bxf2+ {Love it! Did you see it?} 6. Kxf2 Ng4+ 7. Ke1 Qxg5 {I am back at even now...} 8. Nf3 {Not the best move either, I don't think.} Qe3+ {Here my opponent resigned. From our games, I gathered that he disliked trading Queens, so I figure 9. Be2 Nf2 and I win a Rook. Thank you for watching! Please R&C!}
