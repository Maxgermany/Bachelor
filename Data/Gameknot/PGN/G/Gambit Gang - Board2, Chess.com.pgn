1. c4 {I don't like playing against this move at all, so naturally...  } b5 {That will teach you to play a flank opening on me! "U did as your name said: gambit" - Alien43 What else would I do?  } 2. e3 {So I suppose he didn't want to take the pawn...  } Nf6 {Take the pawn!  } 3. Nf3 {I'm running out of 'waiting moves, and he clearly doesn't want to play the move I wanted him to...  } bxc4 4. Bxc4 d5 5. Be2 a5 {Call me crazy, but I was going to put my idea into action no matter what!  } 6. Nc3 Ra6 {Oh yeah? take that!  } 7. Bxa6 Bxa6 {I think my bishop is better than your rook!  } 8. d3 Nc6 9. O-O e5 10. Qa4 Qd7 11. Rd1 Bd6 {I always like to put my bishop here so it aims at the kingside.  } 12. e4 {He anticipated my desire to push the pawn and maybe sacrifice my bishop.  } d4 13. Nd5 {At this point it really seems that I'm in trouble, as if I take his knight, then I'll be forced to exchange queens. However, at this point in the game, I decided to try to shift the focus of the battle from the queenside, where it had been the whole game, to the kingside!  } Nh5 14. a3 {Planning a queenside onslaught, but I think a little more patience was required.  } f5 {My intentions are clear, and there's no turning back now!  } 15. b4 Bxd3 {I think he missed this tactic. My good bishop will sacrifice itself, but for the important compensation of a formidable pawn roller!  } 16. Rxd3 fxe4 17. Rb3 exf3 18. Rxf3 e4 {Finally, the latent potential of the bishop is unleashed...  } 19. Rh3 {This was the move he was counting on to defend. However, he wasn't counting on my response...  } O-O {Now, taking the knight leads to some obscure complications that I'm sure he didn't want to enter (See 'Move List').  } 20. Qb3 {Counterattacking is often a good defence.  Alternative variation: 20.Rxh5? [ This move would have made my job that much easier... ] 21...Qf7! [ And White is left reeling for an answer, as Black is just threatening too much! ]  } Kh8 {The only move.  } 21. Ra2 {He definitely didn't want to take a risk on the knight. See 'Move List'...  Alternative variation: 21.Rxh5 Qf7 22.Nf6!? [ I'm not sure if he saw this tactic or not... ] 23...Qxf6 ( 22...Qxb3? 23.Rxh7# ) 23.f4!? [ What else? White must try to free his game somehow! ] 24...e3! [ But the connected passed pawns should give Black a distinct advantage... ]  } d3 22. Be3 {Over defending the weak point, but the question is whether I can break through somewhere else? I think he'd thought about taking the knight enough for one game, but check 'Move List' to see what would have happened...  Alternative variation: 22.Rxh5!? Nd4! [ Now, trouble emerges from elsewhere... I kind of doubt that he wanted to face this type of attack from the knight... ]  } Nf4 {Finally, the time is right for the knight to re-enter the game.  } 23. Nxf4 Bxf4 {While exchanging into his 'winning endgame' I think he forgot that my minor piece and passed pawn more than compensate.  } 24. Qc3 {I think he was trying to tie my queen to defending the knight...  } Bxe3 25. fxe3 {If he doesn't take with the pawn, there's real trouble brewing (see 'Move List').  Alternative variation: 25.Rxe3?! Qg4! [ And Black is getting a lot of compensation... ]  } Qf7 {Threatening both the rook, and checkmate!  } 26. Qa1 {The only move to meet both threats. Note how passive White's game is!  } axb4 {Space must be cleared for the knight, even if it grants him some counterplay.  } 27. axb4 Nxb4 28. Ra8 {Not a bad defencive technique. However, it's too little, too late!  } Qf2+ 29. Kh1 d2 {Alternative variation: 29...Rxa8?? 30.Qxa8+ [ And White wins. ]  } 30. Rxf8+ Qxf8 31. Rg3 Nd3 {The final blow is delivered by the knight, and White resigned. A thrilling end to one of the best games I've played in a long time!  }
