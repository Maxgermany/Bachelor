1. d4 {annotations by micah wiesner. keep in mind this is a blitz game so there are some blunders but any feedback would still be very helpful} Nf6 {I haven't played too many queen pawn games in my life so to keep it sharp I opted for a gambit, the Gibbens Gambit, played often by Clyde Nakamura to make the game a tad more tactical} 2. g4 Nxg4 {deflecting the knight from the center and opening up a strong g-file for my rooks. Already it is clear I must castle long } 3. e4 d6 4. f3 {4. Be2 h5 5. h3 is also a common line but I didn't know that at the time and also was very content at the idea of controlling such a large center} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 6. Bg5 {6. Be3 may be even stronger but I figured if I was kicked with h6 blacks kingside would just be weakened} Bg7 7. Qd2 O-O {I think my opponent may have castled too soon. Now I am set up to pick apart his kingside pawn structure, exchange his defenders by his kind and he will have a very exposed king} 8. Bc4 {pinning the f7 pawn} c5 {looking for d5 to immobilize my bishop} 9. Nge2 cxd4 10. Nxd4 Nc6 11. O-O-O {My king is safe I still control the center fairly well and my pieces are all on great squares} Nxd4 12. Qxd4 Ng4 {looking for the rook fork on f2} 13. Qd2 Ne5 {With Ne5 black's knight gains a great square and kicks my bishop but also becomes a possible target to my pawns as I plan on opening up the kingside by exchanging my e and f pawn} 14. Be2 Qa5 {adding pressure to c3 but dropping the center pawns. what a blunder} 15. Bxe7 Re8 16. Bxd6 Be6 {black is now down 1 pawn but has great piece placement with bishops on adjacent diagonals pointed at my king. } 17. f4 Nc6 18. e5 {This essentially ruins blacks plan for any attack. My dark-squared bishop also helps put a cap on the d-file and any ideas of counterplay look to have gone down the drain} Nb4 19. a3 Nc6 20. h4 {with my king safe it is finally time to go to work on his} Bf5 {20. h5 may be better for him but bear in mind i still have possibilities with f5 in the future} 21. h5 g5 22. h6 Bf8 23. Nd5 Bxd6 24. Nf6+ Kf8 25. Qxd6+ Ne7 {black's king is essentially trapped but what to do now? I feel like my next few moves may have been a bit too slow and allowed black to stay in the game longer than he should have} 26. Rhg1 Rad8 27. Qb4 Qxb4 28. axb4 {I felt like black had too many weak pieces to defend at this point so simplifying the game by eliminating the queens wouldn't make much of a difference for me} Rxd1+ 29. Bxd1 {protecting c2 and keeping the threat of Rxg5} Rc8 30. Rxg5 Bg6 31. c3 Nf5 {stopping the threat of f5... but not for long} 32. Bc2 Ne3 {a terrible blunder } 33. f5 Nxc2 34. fxg6 fxg6 {if hxg6 then 35. h7} 35. Nxh7+ Kf7 36. Kxc2 Rc4 37. Nf6 Rf4 {everything after this point is just endgames tactics which i'm not very good at as you will see, but i squeeze out the win} 38. h7 Rf2+ 39. Kb3 Rh2 40. Rg4 Kg7 41. Re4 Kf7 42. Rd4 Ke6 43. Rd8 {black resigns 1-0 :) overall I think that the gibbins-weidenhagen gambit is quite playable at my level and is also a fantastic way to get people out of book. From the second move you'll be playing your own game !! :)}
