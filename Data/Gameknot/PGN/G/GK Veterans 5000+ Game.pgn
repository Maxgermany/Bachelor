1. e4 {Book} c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Nxc6 {This is a sideline in the Hyper-Accelerated Dragon. } bxc6 {Capturing towards the center.} 7. Bd2 {This looks too passive to me.  White protects against doubled pawns, but I would not have taken the knight anyway.} Rb8 {Attacking the b-file.} 8. Rb1 e6 {Strengthening my hold on d5 and preparing Ne7.} 9. Bc4 {Looks weak, as the bishop will have to move anyway after d5 is played.} Ne7 10. O-O O-O 11. f4 d5 {Breaking the center.} 12. exd5 exd5 13. Bd3 {White should have played this right away instead of on move 9.} Nf5 14. b3 Qb6+ 15. Kh1 Bxc3 {This allows a fork on white's rook and queen.} 16. Bxc3 Ne3 {...and there it is!} 17. Qf3 Nxf1 18. Rxf1 d4 19. Bb2 Be6 20. f5 Bd5 21. Qg4 c5 22. fxg6 fxg6 23. Re1 {White should choose his squares more carefully...once again, the piece will have to move again!} Rbe8 24. Rd1 Qe6 25. Qxe6+ Rxe6 26. h3 Rf2 {White's case is hopeless now.} 27. c4 dxc3 e.p. 28. Bxc3 Rxg2 29. Bc4 Rd2+ 30. Bxd5 Rxd1+ 31. Kh2 Rxd5 {And white resigns, down 8 points in material.}
