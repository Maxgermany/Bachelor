1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 4. Bc4 {Alternative variation: 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 Nd4  } e6 5. Nf3 Bg7 {We transpose back to  one of the mainlines, typically reached by playing 4. Nf3 and 5.Bc4. I  recently played a game at the Cardinal open in which White played 5. Bb5, the  other main option for the Bishop. } 6. d3 Nge7 {Aiming for the d5 push which  is one of Black's typical plans in this position. } 7. O-O O-O 8. Qe1 d5 9. Bb3 Na5 {Alternative variation: 9. ... Nd4 [The other main choice]  } 10. Qh4 {Now I will exchange  off the LSB, aim to activate my position and bring my bishop pair to bear. } Nxb3 11. axb3 Nc6 12. Qxd8 Rxd8 13. e5 Bd7 14. Ne2 f6 {Looking to undermine  White's pawns, and find an activation plan for the LSB. } 15. exf6 Bxf6 16. c3 e5 17. h3 Bf5 18. fxe5 Nxe5 19. Nxe5 Bxe5 20. d4 Bd6 21. Nf4 cxd4 22. cxd4 Bb4 23. Rf3 {Black has opened the position, found good posts for their  Bishops, and now is ready to deploy their rooks and try to stress White's  doubled pawns. } Rac8 24. Nd3 Bxd3 {I want to keep my DSB, and threats on the  bishop on c1. While I wanted to keep both bishops, my LSB is doing far less  than the DSB. } 25. Rxd3 Rc2 26. Bg5 Re8 27. Be3 a5 28. Rb1 Re2 29. Bf2 {Better is to try to restrict Black's king. Alternative variation: 29. Bh6  } Rc8 30. Re3 Rxe3 31. Bxe3 Rc2 32. Bf4 Bd2 {Looking to trade off White's developed piece and  distract white's pieces with defense of the pawns as I bring the king into  the game. } 33. Be5 Rc1+ {Alternative variation: 33. ... Bc1 [Also wins the pawn, but I was already  looking towards an endgame and did not want to give White chances for  counterplay.]  } 34. Rxc1 Bxc1 35. Kf2 Bxb2 36. Ke3 b5 37. Kd2 Ba3 {Alternative variation: 37. ... a4  38. Kc2 Ba3 [ends up transposing into the same] (38. ... a3 [Also works, but  gives up the a-pawn a bit earlier than I intended to] )  } 38. Kc3 Kf7 39. Bc7 Bb4+ 40. Kd3 Ke6 41. g3 {Allows Black to penetrate Alternative variation: 41. g4 [Forces Black to  take the king around the queenside.]  } a4 42. bxa4 bxa4 43. Kc2 {A bit of a  pointless move as the White king cannot come in through the queenside while  this helps Black to come to e-4. Alternative variation: 43. g4 Kd7 44. Bf4 Kc6 45. Be3 Kb5 [Black  will still win]  } Kf5 44. Bb6 {Alternative variation: 44. Kd3 a3  } h5 45. Kb2 Be1 46. Bc7 Ke4 {And  now Black has far too much of a hold, they can give up the a-pawn while  winning the d-pawn and force White to give up the Bishop for the d-pawn. } 47. Be5 Bb4 48. Kc2 a3 49. Kb3 {The bishop in untakeable } Kd3 50. h4 Be7 {Looking  to attack the Kingside pawns, but taking the d-pawn is far simpler. } 51. Bg7 Bb4 52. Be5 Bc3 53. Kxa3 Bxd4 54. Bf4 Be3 55. Be5 Kc2 56. Kb4 d4 57. Kc4 d3 58. Bc3 Bf2 59. g4 {Here White abandons hope and just plays on for fun } hxg4 60. h5 gxh5 61. Kb4 g3 62. Ka3 g2 63. Be1 Bxe1 64. Ka2 Bb4 {No escape now } 65. Ka1 g1=Q+ {Resigns. This is the second game in a row where a younger  opponent has played "computer" moves just to prolong the game. At least the  last one let me deliver the mate although I will admit the resignation would  have be nice about ten moves ago. }
