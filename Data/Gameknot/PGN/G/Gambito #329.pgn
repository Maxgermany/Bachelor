1. e3 {I was White in this game. 1.e3 is not a common opening move, but it is very flexible and solid.} d5 2. d3 {My opening is considered unorthodox because I have blocked both bishops, but I want to develop my bishops to d2 and e2. A lot of people say that it is a passive setup, but I don't think playing agressive in the opening is necessary, unless your opponent makes a mistake.} Nf6 3. Nf3 Bg4 {I don't think this is a good square for the bishop, because after Be2 the bishop is useless there and is subject to harassment by h3 later} 4. Be2 e6 {Black is initiating a Torre setup, where Black has ideas of pushing the queenside pawns for a queenside attack, or Black can make the maneuvers c5, Nc6 Bd6 Bb8 Qd6 with a kingside attack in mind along the b8-h2 diagonal.} 5. Bd2 {I calmly continue development without thinking about attacking. I don't have any weaknesses, so I should be fine} Bd6 6. Nc3 c5 7. a4 {I'm not sure if this move was necessary. I wanted to stop a future b5, and this was also a waiting move to see if Black would castle into my attack} O-O {Black has castled kingside, which I think is a mistake because I can push my kingside pawns with tempo} 8. h3 Bh5 {Black's other option is giving up the bishop pair to stall the advancing of my kingside pawns, but both continuations look bad for Black} 9. g4 Bg6 10. g5 Nfd7 {Nh5 would place the knight on the dangerous diagonal where my queen and bishop are aimed} 11. h4 f6 {Black wants to get the bishop to a safe square, while also challenging my pawnstorm, but I think this is a mistake because it allows a pawn sacrifice} 12. h5 Bf7 13. g6 hxg6 14. hxg6 Bxg6 {For compensation for the pawn, I have open files toward Black's king, and I can take advantage of Black's weak g6-square} 15. Nh4 Bh7 {No better is Bf7 Bh5 because Black cannot take the bishop since after Qxh5 I have the dangerous threat of Ng6, similar to what happened in the game} 16. Bh5 {My pieces have nice control of the light squares, and my missing pawn doesn't have any significance at the moment since there are still lots of pieces on the board} Ne5 {g5 is interesting, but I think I can just play Ng6 and then f4 later and exploit my open g-file. Black's knight move doesn't really do much to help defend. } 17. f4 Nf7 18. Qg4 Re8 {Qd7 might have been a better way of defending the pawn} 19. Bg6 {I'm clearing way for my queen to come to h5 to continue the attack on the weak light squares, and I'm threatening Bxh7  Kxh7 Nf5  followed by Qxg7#} Bxg6 20. Nxg6 {I'm intending to play Qh5, so Black should move the knight and play Kf7 to stop mates along the h-file.} Bc7 {I thought Black would play Nh6, but after Qh5 the play is similar to my continuation of the game. I plan to castle queenside and bring my other rook to the g-file.} 21. Qh5 {Threatening Qh7#} Nd6 22. O-O-O {I don't think Qh7  now is necessary. I'll just get my rook active on the g-file and continue the attack from there} Nd7 23. Qh7+ {Now the g7-pawn is very weak. Once I get my rook to the g-file Black has a hard time defending.} Kf7 24. Rdg1 {Threatening Nd5  with Qxg7# to follow} Rg8 {This defends g7, but now Black's rook is out of play, and soon my pieces will reach maximum attacking potential.} 25. Nh8+ Kf8 {The only move that doesn't lose material or get mated} 26. Rh6 {Now to capitalize on the g7-weakness, I will double my rooks on the g-file and attack the pawn until Black can no longer defend, and obviously Black cannot take my rook.} Qe8 {Ne8 is another defensive try. Qe8 doesn't appear to do much.} 27. Rhg6 Qe7 {Black's queen has wasted a tempo. Black could've reached this exact same position but with a knight on e8. I'm not sure if Black could've recovered if he hadn't wasted this tempo, but either way, my plan is still the same, I will play e4 and f5 to open the dark diagonal so that my bishop can get to h6 to join the attack} 28. f5 {A clearance sacrifice} Nxf5 29. e4 dxe4 30. dxe4 {Black's knight is kicked away from defending h6, so my bishop comes in} Nd6 31. Bh6 Ne8 {It seems like Black has defended g7......} 32. Rg6xg7 {Now there is trouble because of the pin on whatever piece Black takes my rook with} Rxg7 33. Ng6+ {I force Black to blockade the queen's defense of g7 with his king} Kf7 34. Bxg7 {Now Black's queen is under attack, and I have regained my piece. Black is lost, after he moves his queen his king will perish from the checks} Qd8 35. Bh8+ Ng7 36. Ne5+ {I think this is the easiest way to win} fxe5 37. Rxg7+ Ke8 {If Kf6 then I have many mates to choose from Rg8# Qg6# Rg6# Qh6# or Qh4#} 38. Qg6+ Kf8 39. Qf7# {}
