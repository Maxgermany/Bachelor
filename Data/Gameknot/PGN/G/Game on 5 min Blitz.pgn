1. d4 e6 {e6 is common enough to know a couple of strategies to play with it.} 2. e3 c6 {?, not that this isn't good, I just haven't played many e6c6 players.} 3. Nf3 d5 {on another game, I said that this was an ugly pawn structure, or something like it was. I still don't like it. I wouldn't play it because of the lack of development for black.} 4. Nc3 {mistake #1} Bb4 {Nuntar: I know you've been reading these, I wish that you could've shouted at me not to push a3, because I usually play Ne2 during blitz, protecting that knight, and I wouldn't have ugly pawn structure.} 5. a3 {I'm not sure why, but I thought I had more protection on C3} Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 Na6 {? ok, so the knight can't move anywhere but c7 and retreat, so what's the point of that move, especially with f1?} 7. c4 {going back to the roots of the opening} b5 {this is when things get fun} 8. cxb5 cxb5 9. Bxb5+ Ke7 {besides the move I did, is Ne5 as good as it looked at the time with possible Nc6+?} 10. a4 {this does two things: one the lovely bishop-diagnol pawn perfect defense (not perfect, but it annoys me and my opponent when used against)} Nb4 {this was mistake #2, but salvageable on black's half} 11. Ba3 Qd6 {this looks good on blacks part, but it really isnt} 12. Qd2 Qc7 {ok, so was this just forgetfullness and that an attack on c2 looks bright in the future, because a) that knight is dead b) my queen is kind of guarding that pawn or was this the best place for the queen to retreat? because she definitely had to.} 13. Bxb4+ Kd8 14. Ne5 {NOW i do Ne5} Nf6 {you see? development problems, and despite an obliterated kingside, that bishop still hasn't budged. I just noticed Ba5, which would be amazing (I know someone is going to post saying for me to do that anyway, so I might as well tell you I see it now.) but I like what I do here. remember when I said I sacrifice a bishop for a queen? well, here it is.} 15. Bd6 Qxd6 {oh no! not a free bishop!} 16. Nxf7+ {oh, ok.} Ke7 17. Nxd6 Kxd6 {Ba5 would have me keep my knight, but I'm up a queen to a minor} 18. Qb4+ Kc7 19. Qc5+ {closing in for the kill} Kb8 {this is so close. i could have had a faster mate with Rb1, but this works, too} 20. Qd6+ Kb7 21. Bc6+ {ouch.} Kb6 22. Bxa8+ {double ouch} Ka5 23. Qc5+ Ka6 24. Qb5# {so yeah, that's the game. comments? (now that I'm getting the hang of d4 on white, I'm going to focus a lot more on my black variation) }
