1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 d4 {To be honest, i like the tricky part of the opening and i did analyze it before what to do when some1 answeres at this point with e3 instead of the correct move that SPCMN made here. If you want to see the trap try looking for the lasker trap on youtube or google. SPCMN playd the right move what was to bad for me but great for the game. } 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. g3 {Okay at this point, im getting a bit in a problem. Not that my positions suck but more that im not verry known with this lines. That doesnt say that SPCMN took it wrong but it tells me more that i need to analyze this opening better. In my answere u will be seeing why.} Bc5 {Bc5. I did not analyze the move with a computer before i playd this. I know that it is allowed on gameknot to do, but i dont want to learn it that way. I play the game, and after the game i analyze it.. The computers tells you at this point that Bc5 is a weak move. More like it was Be7} 6. Nbd2 Qe7 7. a3 a6 8. Bg2 {The position of white looks verry solid. and i cant see a way to win the pawn back without giving white a better position. At this point, taking the pawn on e5 looks not weak for black.  I still did it, more with the feeling that if i cant with even pawns i definetly cant win with one pawn less. After it i didnt liked my move and i did realise it was weak.} Nxe5 9. O-O {I think this is the best move for white at this point. White wants me to take the Knight. And i did.. few moves later} Nf6 10. b4 Nxf3+ {the most easiest move to come with at this point will be taking it back with the bisschop, at least.. i think that will be the first answere that enters your mind if you see this. But what SPCMN did was way more stronger!} 11. exf3 {He open up an verry importand line for his rook.} Ba7 12. c5 {I do believe that c5 isn't the strongest move here.. Re1 looks much stronger to me. The only way to avoid exchanging my queen for his rook is to play Be6. Be6 is standing there without any further meaning just a stubborn block to avoid losing the queen. Black also gets in a problem when white decides to move up the f pawn after.. Imagine a pawn on the square f5 and black is in serious problems} O-O {At this point i do believe that the positions are equal again.. But i cant say that im sure if white has enough compensation for the doubled pawn on the f file. But i still got a weak pawn on d4.} 13. Bb2 {good move} Rd8 14. Re1 {I was thinking about knight b3. With this rook move black puts in another defender for the d pawn.} Qd7 15. Ne4 Qf5 16. Nxf6+ Qxf6 17. Bxd4 {This is what i ment. The bisschop cant move and is having problems now. } Qg6 18. Re4 {This is an option but this wont release the white queen yet. I think Qd2 is stronger i believe, follows up with Qc3 and the bisschop is saved and still white is having a pawn up. But maybe with this move he can still keep up the pawn and bisschop.} Bf5 {Just to build off some pressure and to lure and trying to make the move Re4 useless} 19. Re7 {He attacks the the pawn on c7 and at this point i didnt saw the move be6. If i play it here right away the rook can get out. But its fair enough to say that i didnt saw the power of be6 in this position.} Rac8 20. Qd2 {Ok, he decided to release the queen's threat.. but im affraid its to late.} Be6 21. Qe3 Kf8 {And the rook is lost im affraid} 22. Rxe6 Qxe6 23. f4 {Ok now its my time to make a mistake.. I trick SPCMN is awesome if you ask me :)} Qc4 24. Bxg7+ {material is equal at this point but if i accept the sacrifice i still got 3 points more. So i did.. Missing the awesome tricked that SPCMN pulled out of it} Kxg7 25. Qe5+ Kg8 26. Bxb7 {At this point i dont understand why he takes the pawn first. Maybe in hope that i did sacrifice my rook and defend his next moves. But then again i still dont see the thread that im facing right now, so it happen, watch and enjoy :)} Rcb8 27. Qg5+ {ouch... Some alerting lightes are blinding me here. } Kh8 28. Qf6+ Kg8 29. Qg5+ {trying to get out by going to f8 is not an option because the lines are way to open to combine his rook in the attack with white's queen and the bisschop standing on b7 keeping the king out of c8. Maybe that was the reason for move 26. Bxb7. I didnt saw a way out of this without beeing checkmated or sacrifising heavy material to avoid the checkmate} Kh8 30. Qf6+ Kg8 31. Qg5+ Kh8 {Ok here i did recalculated the situation.. And decided even if f8 has a way i out i still dont earn a point here cause of the heavy that i missed. A draw was fine by me. And i think if i dont accept it, i will lose.   So i must say.. Its an verry weird game.. With one good message.. Dont give up to soon. See what white tried to do after he lost the rook.. It ended up in a draw!  Well played SPCMN. }
