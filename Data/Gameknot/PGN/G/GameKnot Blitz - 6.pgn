[Opening "Centre game (C22), Berger variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. d4 {Centre game} exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6 4. Qe3 Nf6 {This is called Berger variation in the database} 5. Be2 {Knight development looks more natural here, and indeed Nc3 is the most often continuation} Be7 {Preparing d4 - Be7 breaks the pin and avoids 7. exd5+, which loses Black's knight} 6. g4 {Now that is an aggressive start of a Kingside attack. Let's see if the attack is powerful enough to compensate White's weakened kingside.} d5 7. f3 {Protects e4} O-O {I decided to castle right into the upcoming pawn storm..} 8. g5 {..which continues promptly} Nh5 9. f4 d4 {If he does not want my pawn, I am okay keeping it for my own micro-storm. I think that White has made a mistake by not taking this pawn earlier, because it will cause problems later on.} 10. Qd2 {This is a mistake that I did not take advantage of. Better was 10. Qf3.} g6 {10. ..Bb4+ 11. c3 dxc3 12. Nxf3 g6 would probably lead to a more balanced position. The line played here led to Black's dark-squared Bishop being locked.} 11. Bxh5 gxh5 12. h4 Bg4 {Now I have a strong spy in White's kingside} 13. Qf2 {Now White wants to develop Queenside and castle, so he frees way for his dark-squared bishop} Bb4+ 14. Bd2 Re8 15. e5 Qd5 16. Rh2 d3 17. c3 {I do not see why he avoids taking this pawn} Qe4+ {A proposal to exchange the Queens} 18. Qe3 {...accepted. But better was probably Be3} Qxe3+ 19. Bxe3 Be7 {Now Black's dark-squared bishop is forced back} 20. Nd2 {White's development is finally complete} Rad8 21. b4 {But he does not want to castle} a6 {Prevents b5, because it would cause Black's Knight escape to b8} 22. Nh3 Kg7 {Since center is possessed by white pawns, why not attack on the side?} 23. Nf2 {He tries to chase my Bishop away} Be2 {But it finds even stronger place} 24. Nfe4 h6 25. gxh6+ Kxh6 {Now I have a route for rook invasion} 26. Kf2 Reg8 27. a4 Rg4 {Adding second attacker for h4 squre and creating a possibility of doubling the rooks} 28. Rah1 Rf8 {preparing for 29. ..f6, which is, of course, a mistake: after 30. e6 White has a passed pawn. Better was Rg8} 29. f5+ Kh7 30. f6 Bd8 {Now Black bishop is completely entangled} 31. Ng5+ Kg6 32. Nde4 {Nc4 was needed here to preserve e-pawn} Nxe5 33. Rg2 Bxf6 {And now both of the very strong pawns fall} 34. Rxg4 Bxg4 35. Nxf6 Kxf6 36. Ne4+ Kg6 37. Kg3 f5 {Now the bishop on g4 is very strong and still covers the very important d1 square that can be eventually used for pawn promotion} 38. Ng5 {I would call it a mistake because d2 square is now defended with only bishop} Rd8 39. Ne6 Rd6 40. Nf4+ Kf7 41. Rh2 b5 42. axb5 axb5 {Freeing potentional path for rook invasion} 43. Bd2 {This is a mistake. After Be2 and Nc4 White loses a piece or else the pawn is promoted} Nc4 44. Kf2 {And this move loses the game. I would call it too complicated for a blitz, but it definetely was fun.} Nxd2 {}
