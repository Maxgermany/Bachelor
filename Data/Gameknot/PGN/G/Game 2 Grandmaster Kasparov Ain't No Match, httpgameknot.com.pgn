1. e4 {In Game 2, Deep Blue (The Computer) is now playing as white.  It starts of with King's pawn to e4.  The makers of "Deep Blue" also added in new programs after its lose to Kasparov the day before.  They downloaded more games of Grandmaster playing to its brain.  Now Deep Blue is fully ready.} e5 {Many great players use pawn to e5 to start out against e4.  I however, stick to the french defense (e6) which works well in all my games.} 2. Nf3 {Deep Blue uses the Kings knight opening and attackings blacks pawn on e5.  } Nc6 {Kasparov continues to play the King's pawn game.} 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez or the "Spanish Opening."} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 {Garry Kasparov continues the Spanish Game and adds a Morphy Defense by playing Nf6.  This attacks whites pawn on e4.} 5. O-O {Both players seem to continue the Spanish Game as Deep Blue improves his King's safety by castling.} Be7 {Kasparov plays a Closed defense by playing Be7.  This also makes way for a future castling.} 6. Re1 b5 {Kasparov attacks Deep Blue's Bishop on a4.} 7. Bb3 {Forcing Deep Blue to retreat his piece, however now that Bishop is in good attacking position as it now attacks blacks pawn on f7.} d6 8. c3 O-O {Kasparov castles.  Here he could have played Ng4 or Bg4.  Both would be attacks.} 9. h3 {Deep Blue plays h3.  This move disables Kasparov's knight/bishop from moving to the g4 square, as they would then be taken.} h6 10. d4 {White attacks black's center.} Re8 {At this point, Deep Blue (white) has a decent lead in this game.  Kasparov has been playing well, but Deep Blue is just playing magnificent.} 11. Nbd2 Bf8 12. Nf1 Bd7 13. Ng3 Na5 {Here, Kasparov plays Na5.  In my mind this is not the best move.  I think he should have taken whites pawn on d4 and lost some center control/position.  This move however does attack whites bishop on b3.} 14. Bc2 c5 {Looking to attack whites center, Kasparov plays pawn to c5.  He has fought himself back into this game.} 15. b3 Nc6 16. d5 {Deep Blue continues to push and attack Kasparov's pieces.} Ne7 17. Be3 Ng6 18. Qd2 Nh7 19. a4 {Still pushing like it did in the last game, Deep Blue plays a2-a4.  This sets up an attack on b5, trying to free up its rook on a1.} Nh4 20. Nxh4 {Finally after 19 moves, they decide to swap.} Qxh4 {Ill let you look at the next moves ahead and think about each ones yourself.} 21. Qe2 Qd8 22. b4 Qc7 23. Rec1 c4 24. Ra3 Rec8 25. Rca1 {Deep Blue loads the A - file with 2 rooks.} Qd8 26. f4 Nf6 27. fxe5 dxe5 28. Qf1 Ne8 29. Qf2 Nd6 30. Bb6 {After annotated a couple of Deep Blue v Garry Kasparov games, I have realized that Deep Blue (the computer) is a much more agressive player and always is looking to advance.  Kasparov on the other hand, takes it plain and simple and defense first.} Qe8 31. Ra3a2 Be7 32. Bc5 Bf8 {Kasparov reading Deep Blues next move, Nf5 attacking his bishop on e7, retreats his bishop to f8.} 33. Nf5 Bxf5 34. exf5 {Sacrafice for position and pawn advancement.} f6 {Stops the advancing pawn on f5.} 35. Bxd6 Bxd6 36. axb5 axb5 37. Be4 Rxa2 38. Qxa2 {Deep Blue sets up for a long rang attack from his Queen and Rook on the A - File in the future.} Qd7 39. Qa7 Rc7 40. Qb6 Rb7 41. Ra8+ {Still not wanting to Sacrafice Queens, Deep Blue puts Kasparov in check.} Kf7 {See Deep Blue's pawns on d5 and f5.  They are defending the 2 open squares on e6 and g6.  Now that the king cannot move to those spots, he is forced to stay in the back two rows.  Bad position for Kasparov late in the game.} 42. Qa6 Qc7 43. Qc6 Qb6+ 44. Kf1 Rb8 45. Ra6 {Wow.  What playing by both players.  You might see the game board even in strength but Deep Blue has an attacking edge and pawn position on Kasparov.  Kasparov resigns, and goes home to study for game number three.  I will have that one ready by tommmorow.  Series tied at 1-1.}
