1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. c3 Nf6 4. d3 {!?} Be7 5. Be2 {White's position is very cramped, but can black take advantage?  Black is not quite so cramped, but he is not mobile enough to take advantage yet.} O-O 6. O-O c5 {! Constrains d4 and moves play along familiar waters.} 7. h3 {I suspect white is angling for kingside expansion, but all the same I like those lines.} Be6 8. Nbd2 Qd7 9. Kh2 {The bishop sacrifice was at the edges of my mind, but he rules it out, or rather guarantees it will be a real sacrifice.} Ne8 10. Ng1 f5 {Probably premature as black cannot hold the square.} 11. exf5 Bxf5 {If Rxf5, then Bg4!} 12. Ne4 d5 {!} 13. Ng3 {A good move, but it is almost the only move: Ng5 meets h6, and Nd2 seems terrible.} Bg6 {Thinking I may want e6 for her majesty.} 14. Bg4 {That and Be6 would meet this move when black's pieces become tied to defensive posts.} Qd6 {Defending the square and removing the queen from immediate and further harrassment from the light-square bishop.} 15. c4 {This is either interesting or dubious.  White clearly has plans for e6 too.} dxc4 16. dxc4 Nc6 {After 17.Qxd6 Nxd6, 18.Be6+ only seems annoying rather than strong.} 17. Qe1 {He reacts to an idea I probably would have played but had not evaluated because I did not expect it: 17.Qe2 Bd3! And the white replies seem to hover around +2.} Nd4 18. Be3 {Completely reasonable.  There are times when you crave sound play; this wasn't one of them.} Nf6 19. Bxd4 {There are times when we say more than we mean and there are times when we mean more than we say; Black can take the bishop pair and probably should have: 19...Nxg4+ 20.hxg4 exd4.} exd4 20. Be6+ Bf7 {And sometimes we say what we seem to mean exactly:  White can deprive black of the bishop pair.} 21. Bxf7+ {And does because d5 was well covered.} Rxf7 22. Rd1 Nh5 {! It's a good idea, but even as I played it I wondered if I let the cat out of the bag too soon.} 23. Kh1 {Black can win the pawn even with this maneuver; Rd3 is a reasonable response.} Nxg3+ 24. fxg3 Rxf1 25. Qxf1 Qxg3 26. Nf3 Rf8 {!} 27. Qe2 {Again Rd3 seems called for.  Black wants to move the bishop to d6 anyway.} Bd6 28. Qe6+ Kh8 29. Rf1 {White has to be very careful here.  Black wants the knight gone.  Black forestalls because of two squares that the white queen guards: e1 and e8.  Black not preparing for the white initiative around e8:  29...Rxf3? 30.Qe8+! (30...Rf8 31.Rxf8+ Bxf8 32.Qxf8#) 30...Bf8 31.Rxf3 Qxf3 32.gxf3 Kg8 ends badly.  White abandoning the e1 and e8 squares: 30.Qd5 Rxf3 31.Rxf3? Qe1+ 32.Rf1 Qxf1#} h6 30. b3 b6 {That white queen! It seems like white may be able to draw: 30...Rxf3 31.Qe8+ Kh7 32.Qe4+} 31. Re1 Rxf3 32. Qc8+ {? Loses the draw; just plain loses.  Qe8+, Qe4+ or black wins.} Kh7 {White resigns.}
