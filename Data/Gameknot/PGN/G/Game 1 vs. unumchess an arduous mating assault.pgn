[Opening "Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00)"]

1. Nc3 {The Dunst (Sleipner, Heinrichsen) opening (A00). I didn't know any replies to this opening, so I play g6.} g6 2. d4 Bg7 {Attacking the center with a fianchetto.} 3. Nf3 {Pulls out the rest of his cavalry.} Nf6 4. Bf4 O-O {I have castled in 4 moves, while he is developing. Needless to say, it seems as though I'm doomed to defense.} 5. e4 d5 {I lash out to confront is strong center.} 6. e5 Ne4 7. Nxe4 dxe4 8. Ng1 {? Right back where it came from. Surely, even h4 would have been better.} Nc6 9. d5 Nxe5 10. Bxe5 Bxe5 {Now the tables have turned: not only do I have a superior defensive position, but a strong center, too.} 11. Rb1 {Stopping Bxb2.} e6 12. dxe6 Bxe6 {Developing my last minor piece. Here is one of White's bigger blunders: b3.} 13. b3 {? This allows a long mating assault. QxQ would have been better.} Bc3+ {Now poor Henry must begin the trek to the middle. This follows one of the chess proverbs: target a centered King.} 14. Ke2 Bg4+ 15. f3 exf3+ 16. Nxf3 {I expected gxf5.} Bxf3+ 17. gxf3 Re8+ {Better than Qe8.} 18. Kf2 Qh4+ 19. Kg1 Re5 20. Be2 Bd4+ 21. Qxd4 {Only option.} Qxd4+ 22. Kg2 Rxe2+ 23. Kg3 Qe5+ 24. Kg4 h5+ {Here he resigned, since mate is unavoidable. Thank you, once again, for this great game, unum! And thank you, reader, for reading. Please R&C!}
