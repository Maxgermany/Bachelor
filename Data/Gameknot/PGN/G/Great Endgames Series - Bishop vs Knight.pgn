Qxc7 Rdxc7 {Once again, we include this game in the present section, because it soon simplifies to a pure minor piece battle. Black's Tarrasch Defence has yielded a nightmare endgame, with the IQP being a target, and his inferior lightsquared bishop. All of White's pieces, bar his king, are trained on the weak pawn and Black is condemned to passivity. He faces a thankless defensive task. 27. h3 h5 28. a3  Naturally, there is no point in White's jumping in with the premature pawn grab 28 Nxd5? after which Black obtains counterplay in the rook ending after 28. ...Nxd5 29. Bxd5 Bxd5 30 Rxd5 Rxd5 31 Rxd5 Rc2.} 27. h3 h5 28. a3 g6 29. e3 Kg7 30. Kh2 Rc5c4 31. Bf3 b5 32. Kg2 Rc7c5 33. Rxc4 {After some preliminary manoeuvring, White takes his first big decision of the ending, exchanging a pair of rooks. Note that this is only possible because Black cannot recapture with the d-pawn (see next note).} Rxc4 {33 ... dxc4? loses a pawn at once after 34. Rd6 a5 35. Rb6. However, 33. ... bxc4!? was worth considering. In return for the blockaded hanging pawns on c4 and d5, Black can hope to attack the backward white pawn on b2. I suspect Kasparov was deterred from this by the awkward position of his rook on c5; it cannot get to the b-file very easily, since it is tied to the defence of d5, whilst bringing the black king over to d6, to free the rook from its defensive duties, would run into e3-e4. Kasparov therefore keeps the pawn structure intact and hopes to use the open c-file as the basis for some counterplay, especially if his d-pawn falls.} 34. Rd4 {White is happy to exchange both rooks, as this will reduce Black's potential counterplay.} Kf8 35. Be2 Rxd4 36. exd4 {The change in the pawn structure is worth commenting upon. On the face of it, White's decision looks a little strange, since now he also has an IQP, and has lost the use of the classic blockading square d4, in front of the enemy IQP. However, as several classic Botvinnik games showed, such "mutual IQP" structures can still confer a significant advantage on White, when, as here, Black has the "bad" light-squared bishop, obstructed by the d5-pawn. A further point in his favour is the presence of the black pawn on b5, which has weakened the queenside dark squares, especially c5. Karpov will no doubt have been familiar with several famous games with the same pawn structure, including Saidy-Fischer, from the latter's famous "clean sweep" US Championship triumph in 1963-4. That game, and other classic examples of this type of endgame, are analysed in detail by Marin, whose treatment of the subject can be highly recommended.} Ke7 37. Na2 {The knight aims for b4, from where it will attack both targets on a6 and d5, as well as threatening sometimes to invade via c6.} Bc8 38. Nb4 Kd6 39. f3 {We have seen such pawn moves a number of times in this book. The white f-pawn "dominates" the enemy knight, depriving it of the active jumps to e4 and g4. The latter square will shortly be weakened by the advance h3-h4, which is necessary in order to free the white king from the defence of the h3-pawn.} Ng8 40. h4 Nh6 {Black in his turn responds to White's 39th move, by seeking greener pastures for his knight. It is heading for f5, from where it will attack the weak white pawns on d4 and g3. The problem is, however, that White can always threaten to eliminate the knight by Bd3xf5, whereas Black has no such option with White's knight.} 41. Kf2 Nf5 42. Nc2 f6 43. Bd3 {Seizing his chance to make the favourable bishop-for-knight trade, now that the g6-pawn has been weakened.} g5 {Black is resigned to the minor piece exchange, which leaves White with a classic knight vs bad bishop position, but in return, Black gets two of his kingside pawns off white squares. However, the remaining pawn is left on h5, fixed on a light square, and isolated.} 44. Bxf5 Bxf5 45. Ne3 Bb1 46. b4 gxh4 47. Ng2 {One of the most striking moves in world championship history. Rather than recapturing automatically on h4, Karpov sacrifices a pawn, in order to open additional lines of entry on the kingside, so that his king can get into the black position. Karpov's move was found during adjournment analysis, but rather than reducing its value, in a strange way it makes it even more impressive. This is for a curious practical reason, which is that when analysing, most strong players tend to effect a pawn exchange, such as that on h4, by simply scooping the g5- and g3-pawns off the board in a single motion of the hand, rather than physically playing the moves 46. ... g5xh4 and 47. g3xh4. As a result, the position after Black's 46th move does not physically arise on the board when one is analysing, which makes it even harder to spot the idea of 47. Ng2 !! . The point of Karpov's idea is that after 47. gxh4 his king would not have a way into the black position. It can get as far as f4 but no further, because Black will, of course, keep the f-pawn on f6, covering e5 and g5. It is not clear how White can make any further progress. } hxg3+ {47. ...h3 does not really help, as after the capture of the h3-pawn, White's king will still have potential access to the h4-square.} 48. Kxg3 Ke6 {Black gives back the pawn at once, but 48 ...Bg6 49. N4 Bf7 50. Kh4 is no improvement. White will take on h5 next move anyway, and Black cannot enter the king and pawn ending, which is lost for him, e.g. 50. ...Ke7 51. Nxh5 Bxh5? 52. Kxh5 Kf7 53. Kh6 and the black king is outflanked after 53. ...Ke7 54. Kg6 Ke6 55. f4 f5 56. Kg5 etc.} 49. Nf4+ Kf5 50. Nxh5 {The effect of White's remarkable 47th move can now be seen. By eliminating the h-pawns, he has "widened the front" on the kingside, and his king now has a potential entry route round the back of the black position, via the h-file.} Ke6 51. Nf4+ Kd6 52. Kg4 {Of course, with a white pawn on h4 and black pawn on h5, this move would have been impossible.} Bc2 {Stopping the white king coming to f5.} 53. Kh5 Bd1 54. Kg6 {It is notable that White is not averse to an exchange of f-pawns. Usually in endings, the stronger side prefers to avoid pawn exchanges, which tend to increase the defender's drawing chances. This is especially true when the exchanges leave all the pawns on one side of the board. However, endings with knight vs bishop are something of an exception, as the knight is especially adept in such positions with all the material on one wing. As we have already seen in the game TorreJakobsen, the knight can overcome a bad bishop even with very limited material, all on one side of the board.} Ke7 55. Nxd5+ {Even for a World Champion at the height of his form, it can be hard to resist the temptation to win a pawn with check, even more so in a minor piece endgame, where material is usually key. However, in this instance, the text is a serious error, which could and should have cost Karpov the win. After his superlative play hitherto, that would have been a tragedy. The problem with the text, as we will see, is that it allows the black king a path into the white position, via d5 and c4. For the time being, White should leave the d5-pawn on the board, where it hampers Black's counterplay, and only take it when the time is ripe. In fact, Karpov's error is a perfect example of breaching our beloved principle "Do not hurry!", and it is rare indeed to see the 12th World Champion err in this respect. The correct winning method was to annex only the f-pawn, and gradually inch his way into the black position, as follows: 55. Nh5! Bxf3 56. Nxf6 Ke6 57. Ne8 (threatening Nc7+) 57. ...Kd7 58. Ng7 (taking the e6-square away from Black's king) 58. ...Ke7 59. Kf5 Kd6 60. Kf6 Be4 61. Nf5+ Kd7 (of course, the king and pawn ending is lost after the exchange on f5) 62 Ke5 (White is gradually inching his way in on the dark squares) 62. ...Bf3 63. Ne3 Kc6 64. Ke6 Be4 65. Nf5 Bf3 66. Ne7+ Kc7 67. Nxd5+. Now that White has full control, he can take the d5-pawn without allowing counterplay, and he will win simply.} Ke6 {55. ...Kd6 56. Nxf6 Bxf3 was suggested by Geller and Mikhalchishin, and appears to draw fairly simply. Compared with the game, it deprives White of the extra option of going after the a6-pawn, and after 57. Kf5 Bg2 58. Kf4 Bb7 59. Ke3 Bc6 60. Kd3 Bb7 61. Ne4+ Kd5 62. Nc5 Bc8 (Marin), White does not appear to have any way to make progress.} 56. Nc7+ {By comparison with the previous note, the analogous line 56. Nxf6 Bxf3 57. Ne8 would be met by 57. ...Kd5 and Black has enough counterplay to draw, e.g. 58. Nc7+ Kxd4 59. Nxa6 Kc3 and White loses his a-pawn.} Kd7 57. Nxa6 Bxf3 58. Kxf6 Kd6 {White now has two extra pawns, but he cannot stop Black obtaining counterplay by ... Kd5.} 59. Kf5 Kd5 60. Kf4 {This tempo gain allows White to consolidate his two-pawn advantage, but it turns out that it is still very hard to convert.} Bh1 61. Ke3 Kc4 62. Nc5 Bc6 {Black plays his bishop over the e4-square, so that a later Ne4 does not block the bishop's control of d5. White has managed to hold onto his material, but it is hard to make progress with the d-pawn without allowing the black king into b3.} 63. Nd3 Bg2 {The immediate 63 ...Kb3? is bad, because after 64. Ne5 Bd5 65. Kd3 Kxa3 66. Kc3 White has consolidated, and the black king is out of play. White will simply bring his knight round to e3 and set his passed pawn in motion. Black must time his active counterplay for a moment when his king can eliminate both white  Queenside pawns, allowing him then to sacrifice the bishop for the remaining white pawn.} 64. Ne5+ Kc3 {64. ...Kb3? is again bad because of 65. Kd3, but waiting tactics by 64. ...Kd5 were also possible. It seems that White can then win if he can arrange the move a3-a4, e.g. 65. Kd3 Be4+ 66. Kc3 Bf5 67. Nd3 Bg4 68. Nc5 Bc8 69. a4 bxa4 70. Nxa4 and the tablebase confirms that this is a win for White, However, in this line, it is still not clear how White makes progress after 67 ...Bd7 68. Nc5 Be8.} 65. Ng6 Kc4 66. Ne7 Bb7 {It seems that this move definitely loses. The critical line was 66 ...Bh1! 67. Nf5 Kd5. This position was the subject of an exhaustive analysis by Marin, who in turn built upon a previous analysis by Timman. Whereas the latter had claimed that White is winning this position, Marin found a key improvement for Black, and after several pages of analysis of this position, he concluded that White cannot win, despite his two extra pawns. One key point is that Timman's 68. Ng3 Bg2 69. Kf2 Bh3 70. Ne2 can be met by 70. ...Bg4! 71. Ke3 Bxe2! 72. Kxe2 Kxd4 when the pawn ending results in a draw.} 67. Nf5 Bg2 {67 ...Kd5 poses only slightly greater problems, as Marin demonstrates: 68. Kd3 Ba8 69. Ne3+ Ke6 70. Nd1 and once the knight reaches c3, Black is helpless, as his king is driven back from d5 and White is preparing a3-a4.} 68. Nd6+ Kb3 69. Nxb5 Ka4 70. Nd6 {A magnificent endgame, despite the errors. Karpov's 47. Ng2!! is one of the most famous moves in world championship match history.}
