1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Nxc6 {Here 6. Be3 is the mainline, and is a bit stronger. White allows Black too much compensation for his underdevelopment.} bxc6 7. Bd2 Nf6 8. Qc1 O-O 9. Be2 {I don't quite understand this move. He lined up the Bishop and Queen to try to undermine my fianchetoed Bishop, but then never ended up attacking it. 9.Bh6 I would think is the more logical move, followed up by a Queenside castle and a pawn storm on the kingside.} d5 {!! This allows me to attack the center, and try to get more devolpment.} 10. e5 {? 10.exd5 is much better} Nd7 11. f4 f6 12. exf6 Nxf6 {Now I am the only one with central pawns.} 13. Be3 {?? A huge blunder. I was already ahead, but this gives me the win.} d4 14. Bc4+ Kh8 15. Ne2 dxe3 16. Qxe3 {Now Black is up positionally and materially.} Nd5 17. Bxd5 cxd5 {Gives me back my pawn in the center, and allows me to further liquidate the material.} 18. c3 Rb8 19. b3 e5 20. fxe5 Rf5 21. e6 {Now he trys to Queen the pawn, an impossible idea with my Queen AND Rook on the back ranks.} Ba6 22. e7 Qc8 23. Kd2 Re5 {This forces him to either trade his Queen for a Rook, or give up a Knight and his pawn. If he chooses to give up the Knight and pawn, he will fall under a large attack.} 24. Qxe5 Bxe5 {He elects to trade off the Queen for the Rook.} 25. Rhf1 Qc5 26. Rf7 Re8 {He can't keep the pawn alive any more.} 27. Raf1 Rxe7 28. Rf7f8+ Kg7 {Here White resigns, as he is down materially and positionally. It was a great game, and I'd like to thank torrey64 for playing it with me. :)}
