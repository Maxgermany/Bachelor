[Opening "English opening (A20)"]

1. c4 e5 {Reverse Sicilian is one I enjoy as it can play mind games for black and gives different options to white with the extra tempo.} 2. e3 {Funny thing is that I immediately try to remove the imbalance of the Sicilian style opening. Removing imbalance as in trying to disrupt opposite dominant sides of the board per player. I see the Sicilian as having good chances for both players.} f5 {Kingside! I had a feeling he would play for the kingside as he previously did in the last blitz game.} 3. d4 exd4 {I think 3. ...e4 is an interesting idea.} 4. exd4 Nf6 5. Nf3 {Not much so far. } d5 6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bd3 {white may lose a tempo to castle. I think Be2 is a safer move for white.} O-O 8. O-O Ne4 {?? This move feels so natural but is so wrong. Black hangs his own pawn and is underdeveloped. } 9. Nxd5 {Taking the pawn and threatening the bishop. Black should simply move his bishop out of harm's way and accept a less than ideal position.} Qd6 {?? Another bad move spells a disadvantage for black.} 10. Bf4 {! and now white has a pretty clear victory as black cannot defend the bishop. His a8 rook may also be killed along with the c7 pawn. White just has so many options of obtaining an advantage.}
