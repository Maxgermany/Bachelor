1. e4 {In this game I used some skill in judging the concentration level of my opponent to win a game I was surely supposed to lose. The last move was an interesting bait.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bc4 Bc5 5. Ng5 d5 {Usually I would castle at this point but this move takes me into the attack with king attacking white knight.} 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. Bxd5 Qxg5 {My bishops are in good positions now. My eyes are on the g pawn but then I realise that the white bishop is attacking it.} 8. d3 Qg6 {f5 was probably a better move. Eyes still on g pawn.} 9. Qe2 O-O 10. Ne4 Qxg2 {This is obviously a mistake as the white bishop is hidden behind the white knight which is a checking position.} 11. Nf6+ gxf6 12. Bxg2 {Now I'm in big problems. The queen is gone and my king is quite exposed.} Nd4 {Just chasing white around to see what mistakes he can make.} 13. Qd2 Bh3 {This move should lead to Nf3 in case white does not see it.} 14. Bxb7 {This is a good capture but white's attack is quite disbanded. The white bishop is not in the attack, the black bishop and a rook are inactive.} c6 {I'm still trying to make a folk with Nf3 to regain my queen and this time white's white bishop is even more isolated from the attack.} 15. Bxc6 {Well read. But white has makes a sacrifice. Qh6 would have been a better move.} Nxc6 16. Qh6 {A bit late but a good enough attacking move. Now I have only one sensible option....Bf5.} Bf5 17. Rg1+ Bg6 {In this position black's white bishop plays the same role as a pawn but better as it can attack faster when possible.} 18. c3 Rad8 19. Rg3 Rfe8 {Trying to use as many pieces as possible to try to match up to the queen lose.} 20. Bd2 e4 {An effort to have 2 open flanges occupied by rooks.} 21. d4 {Good move by white but it turns out bad later as the white bishop is brought into the attack.} Bd6 22. Rg2 Na5 23. O-O-O Nc4 24. Bf4 Bf8 25. Qh4 f5 26. Bg5 Rdb8 {At this point black has a good attack but an inexperienced player may not be able to see it. My next move would have been Ba3 if allowed to make it.} 27. b3 f4 {This was to produce 28. bxc4 e3. I somehow suspected that white would not see the mate.} 28. Bxf4 e3 {Now white seems to have 2 big pieces that black can lose but these sacks' being captured would lead to a mate.} 29. Bxb8 Ba3# {So having sensed my opponent's strength and seen that he was an intermediate player I managed to trick him. And I just had to win this game in this tourney.}
