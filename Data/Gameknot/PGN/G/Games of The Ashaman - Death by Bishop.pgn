[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor Defense, considered inferior to the Queen's Knight and Petroff Defense because it blocks in the dark-squared bishop. Oddly there is no recorded game where Philidor played this.} 3. d4 {Challenging Black's center, and trying to open up the game.} f6 {Defending the center, a poorer move than Nd7 or exd4. This unfortunately takes Black's Knight's best square and weakens the Black Kingside.} 4. Bc4 {Developing the Bishop which turns out to be the key piece in the combination.} Ne7 {I think Nd7 was best here.} 5. Nc3 {Dxe5 immediately was best but I didn't see that then, I just developed normaly.} a6 {?? Trying to keep my knight and bishop off this square, but missing the threat of dxe5.} 6. dxe5 {Starting the combination, which with good play on each side wins only a pawn.} fxe5 {b5 or Nbc6 here were much much better, this was his first real blunder.} 7. Nxe5 {Threatening mate, a hard threat to deal with.} dxe5 {?? Big blunder which loses the queen. I think d5 here was the only move.} 8. Bf7+ {Wins the queen, Black resigns. }
