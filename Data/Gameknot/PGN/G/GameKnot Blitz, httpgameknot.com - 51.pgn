1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {I've found this is the best way for me not to get slaughtered in the opening.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Be2 Bd6 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 {So far, pretty standard. Nothing too unusual. Not a lot of threats, but not many weaknesses. } c6 8. Bg5 {Provocative. } h6 9. Bh4 {I am attempting to provoke black to weaken his kingside.} Be6 10. Ne5 {Even more provoking. } Nbd7 11. f4 {Now my knight isn't going anywhere.} Qc7 {Removing the pin. I am attempting to structure my pawns to block off defenses on the kingside. Maybe it will work. We shall see.} 12. Kh1 {This was a blitz game. I wasn't sure what to do but knew I needed to get my king off the diagonal. } Bf5 13. Bd3 Bxd3 14. Qxd3 Rfe8 {Black really wants the knight to die. Can't blame him, he is rather irritating. } 15. g4 Be7 {15. ... Bxe5 16. fxe5 Nxg5 17. Qf5 Ne3 18. Qxf7+ Kh8 19. Rg1 and white is doing well.} 16. g5 Nxe5 17. fxe5 {This is where things get interesting. } Nh7 18. Rxf7 {!? This makes the game more interesting. Black's best continuation is Nxg5 and he know must deal with an open kingside. Instead, this is what happened.} hxg5 {?? This loses quickly.} 19. Qg6 Bf8 {The only way besides Bf6.} 20. Rxc7 gxh4 {?? Black was already lost but this speeds things up.} 21. Rg1 Re6 22. Rxg7+ Kh8 23. Rxh7# {It was a good game, although white's calculations were only OK. Not great, but enough to shake an opponent during blitz.}
