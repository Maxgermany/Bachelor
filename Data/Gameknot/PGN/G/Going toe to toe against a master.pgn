[Opening "King's Indian (A48), London system"]

1. d4 {My usual move. I avoid e4 because of the Sicilian theory} Nf6 {Indian defense. This is overwhelmingly the most popular defense to d4 I see now.} 2. Nf3 {Avoiding the main lines after 2. c4. I heard that my opponent plays the Gruenfeld (2.c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5) but I did not bother with it because I knew that he would know much more theory than me.} g6 {Still playing the fianchetto setup popular in the King's Indian Defense} 3. Bf4 {London System. I like this against 1...Nf6 because it is flexible, avoids theory, and restricts Black's fianchettoed DSB} Bg7 4. e3 O-O 5. Be2 {The Bishop is best at e2 against this setup. d3 would be the normal place for the bishop, controlling e4 but it's biting against the pawn on g6. The eventual plan is to get the Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal} d6 6. h3 {Now if ...Nh5, White can retreat his Bishop back to h2 to keep the Bishop pair} c5 {Attacking that pawn on d4 to gain space for his DSB} 7. c3 {White does not want the long diagonal to be open so he will make sure his pawn on d4 is supported after an eventual capture on d4} Qb6 8. Qb3 {Not fearing Qxb3 axb3 where White's a1 rook has a half open a-file} Qc7 {I would argue it is better to trade Queens though because now Black has wasted time and allowed White to gain a tempo after putting his Queen on b3. } 9. O-O b6 {Black made this move mainly to avoid any possible captures on c5 due to the pin on the Queen. This also leaves the possibility to fianchetto his other Bishop to contest White's Bishop on the other long diagonal} 10. Nbd2 Nc6 11. Bh2 {A purely prophylactic move. Black can now possibly play a pawn break to e5, hitting the Bishop. This move anticipates that and avoids any possible e4 moves made possible by attacking the Bishop after pushing the e-pawn to e5.} h6 {Not quite sure of the purpose behind this move actually. White has no intentions of putting any piece on g5} 12. Rfc1 {Moving pieces over to the Queen side. White's plan is to attack Black's pawn base with a4 and then a5.} Bf5 13. Nh4 {?! Really a waste of times. I made this move because I didn't want my Queen to be moved back to it's original square after 13.a4 Na5 14. Qd1 but White has a move like 14. Qa2 and it is possible to move b4 and hit the knight with a tempo} Be6 {Attacking the Queen and redirecting the Bishop to arguably a better square} 14. Qc2 Rac8 15. e4 {Another questionable move. I wanted to threaten the fork with d5 but Black can avoid it if he plays correctly. It is probably better for White to continue with the plan of breaking down the Queenside with a4-a5. This opens the position for Black's benefit.} cxd4 {Pretty much forced. Trying to avoid the fork by moving the Bishop with 15... Bd7 16. d5 Na5 looks very cramped for Black.} 16. cxd4 Qb8 {Now Black opens up discoveries upon moving his c6 knight and, in turn, threatens the pawn on d4. White has to move his Queen while protecting his pawn} 17. Qa4 {Another option I was thinking about was 17. Qd3 but I didn't like the looks of my position after 17... Nb4 18. Qg3 Nxa2 where Black gains control of the c-file and can open up his DSB wit something like 19...Nd7} Bd7 {At first, the possible discovery on the Queen is scary but, in reality, White has nothing to fear yet.} 18. Nhf3 {White must get this knight back into play and protect the d4 pawn} Ne5 {Using that discovery} 19. Qd1 {I was also thinking about 19. Qb3 as an alternative but I feel this gives more possible protection to the d4 pawn} Nxf3+ 20. Bxf3 {20. Nxf3? Nxe4 and Black is better} Nh7 {Putting pressure on d4 again} 21. e5 {! I feel like this was one of my better moves in the game. White wants to open up space for the Bishop on f3 and try to close off the now strong g7 bishop. } dxe5 22. Qe2 {Of course White does not want to recapture immediately because it loses a pawn. However, I think 22. Nc4, planning to recapture on e5 with the knight, is stronger here. The knight is well placed and it can open up possible discoveries on the Queen with Nxg6. The text is still not bad } Ng5 23. dxe5 Nxf3+ 24. Nxf3 {Play is about even. Black has the two Bishops but White's position is good too. Black must be wary of an eventual e6 move from White} Qb7 {Finally stepping of the h2-b8 diagonal} 25. Nd4 {Centralizing the Knight and supporting the e6 pawn push} e6 {This stops e6 but leaves the d6 square as a juicy outpost for the knight...} 26. Nb5 {White jumps at the chance for d6 immediately/ I was hoping to entice Black to give up his Bishop pair advantage with 26...Bxb5 but Black has another response} Rxc1+ {Playing Qa6 immediately works too} 27. Rxc1 Qa6 {Hitting the knight and pinning it to the Queen} 28. a4 {!? White can escape the pin with 28. Nc3. I was wary of going to an endgame where Black has the Bishop pair with 28... Qxe2 29. Nxe2 but with the DSB locked in on g7 and the White rook controlling the c-file for the time being, White shouldn't worry.} Qxa4 {I think 28...Bxb5 was better in the position for Black. After 29. axb5, it gives him an eventual pawn weakness to attack later on in the game} 29. Nd6 {The White knight bolts for the d6 square. After this move, my opponent, who had been wandering from time to time, stayed glued to his seat. The battle began to heat up.} b5 30. Bg3 {I wanted to play Rc7 immediately but Black still has back rank threats if White is not careful. Bg3 is a waiting move that gives the king a getaway place on h2} Qa5 {Preventing Rc7} 31. Rc5 {31. Qc2 with the intent of 32. Qc7 was preferable in this position} Qb6 32. Qc2 {This still is good for White now. 33. Rc7 is inevitable. The pawn doesn't matter right now, White has more than enough compensation for that pawn due to his superior pieces} a5 33. Rc7 {Black is starting to feel the heat} Rd8 {? A losing move! 33...Be8 was necessary to protect the Bishop here. However...} 34. Rb7 {? White misses the winning move! 34. Nb7! wins the Bishop. Black should continue 34...Bc6 35. Nxd8 Qxc7 but 36. Nxc6 followed by Nd4 wins for White. This close to taking him down... This move still reaches a draw however.} Qc6 {Only move. Something like 34...Qa6 would fail to 35. Rxd7 Rxd7 36. Qc8+} 35. Qxc6 Bxc6 36. Rxf7 Rxd6 {Hoping for 37. exd6 Kf7 where White is down a piece} 37. Rxg7+ {An in between move that sends the game into a drawn position} Kxg7 38. exd6 Kf6 {Getting the King into the center} 39. Bf4 h5 40. Be3 {40. Bd2 was better, winning a tempo with 40...a4 41. Bb4} Ke5 41. Bb6 {White wastes more time} a4 42. Bc7 Kd4 {Black's king position is much better now but this is still a draw...} 43. Kf1 Kd3 44. Ke1 Kc2 {44... Bxg2?? 45. d7} 45. d7 {Necessary. Black cannot win the pawn on b2.} Bxd7 46. Be5 b4 47. Ke2 {I was running really low on time at this point, about 6 minutes left on my clock to his 15} a3 48. bxa3 bxa3 {White's Bishop is going to sacrifice himself for that a pawn} 49. Ke3 g5 50. f4 {Also drawing was 50. g4, fixing the g pawn on a dark square so Black's bishop cannot defend it} g4 51. hxg4 hxg4 {The critical juncture in the game} 52. g3 {?? A bonehead move that throws away the draw. 52. Kf2 wins the g pawn and in turn, draws the game. 52. Kf2 a2 53. Kg3 Kb1 54. Kxg4 a1=Q 55. Bxa1 Kxa1 is a line that could happen. Black's king is too far away to support his own pawns. White could play 56. Kf3 followed by g4 and f5 to trade for Black's last pawn. 52...Be8 is too slow 53. Kg3 Bh5 54. Kh4 wins the g-pawn. I had Kf2 in my sights but my calculations were all jittery and full of anxiety and I miscalculated the position of the Black Bishop} Be8 {! Black now wins by getting the Bishop to f5, defending both pawns} 53. Bd4 Bg6 54. Ke2 Bf5 {White is lost. The rest is without annotation} 55. Be5 Kb1 56. Kd2 a2 57. Bd4 a1=Q 58. Bxa1 Kxa1 59. Kc1 Ka2 60. Kd2 Kb2 61. Ke3 Kc3 62. Ke2 Kd4 63. Kd2 Ke4 64. Ke2 Bg6 65. Kf2 Kd3 66. Kf1 Ke3 67. Kg2 Ke2 68. Kg1 Kf3 69. Kh2 Kf2 {After the game, I knew I had missed the draw at least (I didn't find the win until later). Games like these are encouraging and deflating. On one hand, I had a winning position one of the top juniors in the state. On the other hand, I still lost.. Anyways, I hope that you all enjoyed this annotation. Comments are always encouraged!}
