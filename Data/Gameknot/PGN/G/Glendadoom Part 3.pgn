1. c4 {Hi everyone!  She's at it again!  Things have a habit of coming in threes, don't they?  Well, on that Saturday they certainly did.  My opponent this time was dmaestro who beat me in that 60 mover where I lost against him because I chose to take off the wrong pawn.  If I had taken the central pawn instead of the side pawn I would have clawed back half a point off him but it wasn't to be.  On move 18 he just did not know what was gonna hit him.  So how did this happen, well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of our game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18563197&rnd=0.8681993657365421} Nf6 {1. ..... Nf6 - I decided to kick off with the English Opening and Mike responded by developing a knight.} 2. Nc3 d6 3. d4 {3. d4 - vigorous play in the centre is called for here.} Nbd7 4. Nf3 e5 5. e4 {5. e4 - and more of the same here.} Be7 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O c6 8. Re1 Ne8 9. Bf1 {9. Bf1 - looks passive but is clearing a path for my rook.} Qc7 10. Rb1 g6 11. b4 {11. b4 - behold - a wall of white pawns!} f5 12. exf5 gxf5 13. dxe5 dxe5 {13. .... dxe5 - Mike gets his pawn centre but he has exposed his king.  Can I capitalise on this?  We shall see.} 14. c5 b6 15. Bc4+ {15. Bc4+ - this bishop rakes through the BK's position which has got far too many cavities for The Dentist to fill.  I however, will certainly find a way to fill them - in a way that he will not want!} Kg7 16. Ng5 {16. Ng5 - threatening a family fork on e6 so black must play BxN.} Bxg5 17. Bxg5 bxc5 {17. ..... bxc5 - white wins a pawn, but it is a poisoned pawn because, just look at who is hopping on her broomstick, all the way to h5 .......} 18. Qh5 {18. Qh5 - GL-EEE-NDA!} Ndf6 {18. .... Ndf6?? - after this move, I realised I had a forced mate in 3.  I played my next move and announced the mate to my opponent, giving him the option of resignation.  He immediately resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  Can you work out the mate?  Answers on a postcard, please.} 19. Qh6+ {}
