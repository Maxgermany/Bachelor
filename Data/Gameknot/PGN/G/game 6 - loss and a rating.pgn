1. d4 c6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. h3 Bf5 {I'm hoping for this to be an instructive game for me to analyze and to see where I might have played better.  All comments are much appreciated and welcome.  I will try to post on the forum, and might need to join the site to do that.  I've entered in the GM tourney for July.} 5. e3 e6 6. a3 h6 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3 Bd6 9. Bxd6 Qxd6 10. Nf3 O-O 11. g4 Nbd7 12. g5 {This move caused me much difficulty, in determining how to respond.  Taking the pawn results in attack on h7.  Otherwise I feel my position was good.  Comments pro or to the contrary are welcome.  } Nh5 {Going nowhere, and not a good move.  Nh7 would be better, attacking the pawn, however white would destroy my kingside pawns.  My position must not have been very good after all.  } 13. gxh6 {Well there it goes anyway, and nothing stopping Ng5.  Game destroyed.  That pawn will be there for quite a long time.  It's amazing that I held on for 44 moves.} g6 14. Ng5 e5 15. O-O-O e4 16. Qe2 Ndf6 17. h4 Nh7 18. Rdg1 {I } f5 { I was trying to open the position, but this removed the protection from g6.} 19. Nh3 Rf6 {Kf7 would have worked.  I didn't want his pawn on g5 with Ng5 NxN, but could have simply moved K back to g7.} 20. Qxh5 {Obviously.  So much for defense. } Kf7 21. Qe2 Ke7 22. Na4 Rh8 23. Nc5 b6 24. Nb3 Qc7 25. Rg3 Kf7 26. Rhg1 {My hope is to hold on with the complicated position, and possibly come out with a draw.  However, white is relentless. } Nf8 27. h5 {Getting more complicated.  } Rxh6 28. Nf4 Qd7 29. hxg6+ Kg7 {Knight fork takes rook.} 30. Nh5+ Rxh5 31. Qxh5 Rxg6 32. Rg3xg6+ Nxg6 33. Qxg6+ Kf8 34. Rh1 Qg7 {Exchanging queens.} 35. Qh6 Qxh6 36. Rxh6 Kg7 37. Rxc6 Kh7 38. Rc7+ Kh6 {Come on, get the pawns.} 39. Rxa7 Kh5 40. Rb7 Kg4 41. Kd1 Kf3 42. Ke1 {White protects the pawns.  Good game by white.  How do I make paragraphs in this annotation?  I've decided to slow down and take a lot more time for my moves.  I've been self analyzing them more the last day, but think I'm still moving too fast, so I need to study them more.  Yesterday I made a move after considerable consideration, then realized seconds later that I'd made an obvious mistake, not taking a pawn. }
