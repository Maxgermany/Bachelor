1. e4 {I went with the e4 opening.  Since I know how to play against the Sicilian with c3, I don't shy away from e4 any more.} e5 {King's Pawn Opening.} 2. Nf3 {I developed, attacking the pawn.  I didn't have a clear strategy yet, just developing.} d6 {Continued development.} 3. Bc4 {I thought this would be a perfect little spot for my Bishop along the a2-g8 diagonal.  I was eyeing down on that f7 square.  At this point I thought if I could get my Queen over, I could form a pretty successful attack on the King side.} Nf6 {Adding an attacker on the d5 square.} 4. Nc3 {Adding another defender on the d5 square.  Now, 4. Nc3 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxd5(or Bxd5) ... and I have successfully defended against the attack.  } Be7 {Further development.} 5. h3 {Eliminating the possibility of a Bg4 pin.} O-O 6. d3 {Now that he castled I knew his King was going to stay there, so I can begin my assault.  First, I open up my Bishop to get involved.  I was weary of closing off my light square Bishop from joining the attack, but it was already involved by putting pressure on the f7 square.} Nh5 {I believe this was an attempt to form an attack.  It opened up the way for his Bishop to come over.} 7. Be3 {Now I saw the possible benefits of having my Bishop and Queen on the same diagonal.  I believe I was considering 8. Qd2 ... 9. Bg4 Bxg4, then I could either exchange Queens or accept the extra Bishop, but a better opportunity arose...} Bh4 {...With this move.  I could see he was looking to trap me into 8. Nxh4 Qxh4, and he would have an active Queen on the King side.  So, I continued my attack preparations hoping he would hold off on Bxf2.} 8. Qd2 {I think this rather halted the proposition of Bxf2, since it would now give me the opportunity to bring my Queen over.} Nc6 9. Nxh4 {Now I take the Bishop, since after 9. Nxh4 Qxh4 10. Bh5 ... his Queen is trapped.} Qxh4 {Now he falls into my trap.} 10. Bg5 {Traps the Queen and serves the dual purpose of forming the attack that I'd wanted from the beginning.} Ng3 {I liked this move.  I was expecting Qxg5.  I couldn't take the Knight because fxg3 would lead to Qxg3 and he would preserve his Queen.  } 11. Bxh4 {Now the sequence is finished.  After Nxh1, O-O-O traps his Knight.} Nxh1 12. O-O-O {Bingo.  He can't preserve the Knight, either.} Nd4 13. Be7 {I could have taken the Knight, but instead I saw a more hefty prize.} Re8 14. Qg5 {Backing up that Bishop and also prepping for a mate.} Nxf2 {The best move would have been 14. ... Rxe7 15. Qxe7 Bg4.  This would have stopped the mate.  Sure, it would have resulted in heavy casualties but would have made the game go on longer.} 15. Bf6 {The pinned pawn on g7 prevents him from taking on f7.  A great example of how the chess tactics puzzles have been helping me.  Now the mate is forced.  15. Bf6 Ne6 16. Bxe6 g6 17. Qh6 fxe6 18. Qg7#.} g6 16. Qh6 {Nothing he can do.  He has Ne6 which will be taken by Bxe6.  He also has Nf5 which will be taken by exf5.  } Nf5 17. exf5 Ng4 18. Qg7# {Checkmate.  I learned a lot from this game.  I didn't go with a special opening, I just developed my pieces in a way that be beneficial in the long run.  Had I never developed with my Bishop on c4, the mate wouldn't have been possible since Ne6 would have stopped it.  Sure, I capitalized on his errors, and had he never taken with his Queen on h4 the game would have gone much differently, but I feel like I played a strong game and it gave me a lesson on forming an attack, patience, and positional play.  Thanks, and good game kancer!}
