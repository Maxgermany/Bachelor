[Opening "King's knight opening (C40)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Bc5 3. Bc4 d6 {This is a bit passive.} 4. d4 exd4 {I thought about just castling here, but I couldn't get okay with losing the pawn in this position.} 5. Nxd4 Qe7 {I think this is where everything goes wrong for black. It seems like a good idea to pin the pawn to my king but the pawn is poisoned after...} 6. O-O a5 {Perhaps he is planning b5?} 7. Nc3 c6 {Preventing Nd5 or Nb5} 8. Nf5 {I decide to open the e file or cause black to become more passive.} Bxf5 9. exf5 {Black is at a critical position here since he needs to figure out how to develop his king without losing his queen.} Qf6 {I think this is the best move.} 10. Ne4 {I decide to go aggressive. } Qxf5 11. Nxd6+ Bxd6 12. Qxd6 {Now my queen is close to the black king and threatening to prevent him from castling. If he plays 12. ... Ne7 then 13. Re1 pins the knight to the king and the king cannot castle.} Qd7 {Probably best.} 13. Qg3 {I decide not to go for the quick check on e1. g7 is weak and will delay him a tempo.} f6 14. Bf4 {Threatening to win the knight.} Na6 15. Rad1 {Separating the queen and king. Black is lost here.} Qf5 16. Qxg7 {! The winning move. Black's king is toast.} Qxf4 17. Qf7# {Simple ending. Comments welcome!}
