1. f4 {Lately I'm trying Bird's opening in Blitz chess .} e6 2. e4 d5 {Some times I play Nf3 here, but this time I was trying something else.} 3. exd5 Qxd5 {Here my opponent take his Queen out.} 4. Nc3 {Let's make his Queen run across the board a little bit :).} Qf5 5. d3 {protecting my f pawn.} Nf6 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be3 {Whit this move I'm closing down on his Queen.} Bd6 8. Nh4 {He has only one place to go whit his Queen. I couldn't take control of a5 square, because a lot of moves has to be taken (2: 8.a3....9.b4....10.Nh4) but how could i know, if his Queen would remain on f5 so long. Unless 8.a3 b5 9.Nh4 and his Queen is lost.} Qa5 9. a3 b5 10. b4 {Another attack, only a6 square to go, or...} Nxb4 {sacrifice the knight for two pawns} 11. axb4 Qxb4 {now my knight is in trouble, so...} 12. Bd2 {bishop must go to d2 to protect him, but i leave my pawn on d4 hanging} Bxf4 {now we are even in material} 13. Nf3 Bb7 14. Be2 {preparing to castle} h6 {??} 15. O-O Bd6 16. Rb1 {it's time to attack his Queen :)} Qc5+ 17. Kh1 {I think the better move would be 17.d4 Qc6 18.Bb5 winning his Queen or 17.d4 Qa3 18... or 17.d4 Qf5 18... but i missed that} a6 18. d4 {a little bit late but still good enough} Qc6 19. Nxb5 {I have set a trap here if 19....axb5 20.Bxb5 forking the Queen, but my opponent saw that} O-O 20. Nxd6 cxd6 21. c4 Ne4 22. Be3 {here is a mistake I made, but luckily my opponent didn't see the move 22....Nc3 forking my Queen and rook} f5 23. Rb3 {correcting my mistake} a5 {??} 24. d5 exd5 25. cxd5 Qxd5 26. Qxd5+ {finally the Queens are off the table} Bxd5 27. Ra3 a4 28. Bb5 Bb3 29. Nd4 {here I could play 29. Bc6 forking his knight and rook on a8, i saw that later in the game.} Nc5 {protecting his bishop but the pawn on f 5 is mine :)} 30. Nxf5 {mljask} Ne4 {protecting another pawn but i have another move in my mind....but again I didn't saw 31.Bc6} 31. Ne7+ {well this move was in my mind} Kh8 32. Rxf8+ {exchanging rooks} Rxf8 {now here is my biggest mistake of the game I overlooked a fork 33.Ng6+...winning the rook and putting the game into my advance} 33. h3 {that is why I overlooked a for, because I was worried about my King.} Ra8 34. Bc6 {finnaly I have seen the move Bc6} Ng3+ 35. Kh2 {I think better move would be 35.Kg1} Nf1+ {that is why it would be better to play 35.Kg1} 36. Kg1 Rf8 {??} 37. Ng6+ {finally I have seen this fork :). Here my opponent resign. I think this was a pretty good game whit a lot of missed opportunities, but that is Blitz chess. Have a nice day.}
