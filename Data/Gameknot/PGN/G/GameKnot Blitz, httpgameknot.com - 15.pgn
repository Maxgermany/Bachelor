1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. Nbd2 h6 {Suboptimal, but understandable. This is a very classic London scheme. } 5. h3 {I return the courtesy. My move aims for a pawn's storm on the kingside. } e6 {Passive. The idea is to make my previous move a waste of time. But it is not quite so. } 6. e3 a6 {Another passive move by black. Not bad, just passive. } 7. g4 {Starting my thematic plan. Not a very successful one, to say the truth, but always fun. } Bd6 {As expected. } 8. Ne5 {Thematic, too. It can be played safely if black keeps his N on f6 (so not to play f6 at some point, even if... well, that's another story). Black can take with the B, and then retire the N to d7... that doesn't look so promising. } Ne4 {Not necessarily better than Nd7, because of...} 9. h4 {White is prepared for that. The pawns are marchin' in. Again, this is not a gimme for white. Yet. } Nxe5 {One of the possible moves. This allows to me the "surprise" retake...} 10. dxe5 {...winning a tempo, and being the black squares on my queenside strong enough to hold against a strong attack. At least I believe so. } Be7 {I can play Nf3, supporting the pawn, at the cost to being unable to play f3 to kick the white knight... all a very known game, and not really very interesting. I decided to play the other way and see what would happen...} 11. Nxe4 dxe4 12. Qxd8+ Bxd8 {My h pawn is safe, his pieces are not developed but with better potential than mine. Here my opponent started to go under with tempo so I started to write down my moves quickly... and I allowed the situation to complicate. And I made SO many mistakes...} 13. Bg2 {Attacking the pawn. I can't allow black to reorganize his pieces. Time is all. } f5 14. exf6 e.p. {My dsb is free. Other answers would have lead to the same result. } Bxf6 {I have a pawn hanging, but I want my B to be really strong, and a central pawn...} 15. Bxe4 {? Not necessary. After a defensive move like o-o-o, black can't save the e5 pawn anyway, so no need to lose one. } Bxb2 16. Rb1 Bc3+ 17. Ke2 Rb8 {I can take the pawn, but much better would be, again, Nc6+ [Edit:Bc6+]. l didn't see the strong next black's move, but I don't know how to stop it anyway. } 18. a4 {? Not a bad move as it will be useful later, but not now. A player should have seen Bc6+ or Bxc7, both very strong. I just made my second mistake. The problem is that I am allowing black...} e5 {Ouch!!!! Novice's mistake punished. } 19. Bg3 Bxg4+ {Ouch again! } 20. Kd3 {!? Not fearing Rd8+ because of the threat on the B. f3 would have been much better!} Ba5 {I just forced him to abandon e5. } 21. Bc6+ {...but now I see the check and played it, to prevent him to castle. } Ke7 22. Bxe5 {?? Giving the bishop. But wait:} Bf5+ {?? Black prefers to keep on harassing my king, but this is a mistake since...} 23. e4 {Now black virtually lost the piece!} Rbd8+ 24. Kc4 Be6+ 25. Bd5 {If c6, Rxb7+. } Bxd5+ 26. exd5 {This outcome gives black a fork with the b7 and g7 pawns, both threatened. } b6 27. Bxg7 Rh7 28. Be5 Kd7 29. f4 {It seems that the engdame is a gimme for white, since the f pawn is unbalancing the game in its favour. } Rf8 30. Rhf1 Rf5 31. Rbd1 Rhf7 32. d6 c6 33. Rfg1 b5+ 34. Kb3 {Black won't take because he doesn't want to disrupt his pawn's chain. } Bd8 35. Rg6 {? I should have gone Rg8, so after Bxh4, Ra8 poses a double trheat on black (Rxa6 and Ra7+ followed by d7).} h5 36. Rh6 {?? Just a waste of time. } Bxh4 37. c4 {Trying to do something. } Bg3 {Black managed to get  a nice position, given the disadvantage. Mistakes cost!} 38. cxb5 {Just a little tricky. I allow my f4 pawn to be taken, but fo good reasons. } cxb5 39. axb5 axb5 40. Rc1 {! This was the plan. White now has too many threats to be met. Rc7+ starts dangerous lines for black. } Bxf4 41. Rc7+ {My opponent resigned here. Let's suppose: } Ke8 42. Rh8+ Rf7f8 43. Rc8+ Kd7 44. Rc7+ Ke6 45. Re7+ Kd5 46. d7 Bxe5 47. Rxf8 Rxf8 48. Re8 Bf6 49. Rxf8 Be7 50. d8=Q+ Bxd8 51. Rxd8+ {}
