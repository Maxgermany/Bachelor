1. e4 c5 {I tried diffrent variations against e4 but nothing has proven to be better than sicilian.} 2. c4 {White pushed the game into Gloria variation. I've rarely met this variation so I decided to follow the book strictky or at least as far as I could.} Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 4. d3 Bg7 5. Bg5 {Until this move everything was usual. I don't know what the idea of ths move was but it didn't existed in the DB. I decided to castle early, because as I said I haven't played the Gloria variation so often.} Nf6 6. Bxf6 {Well if Bg5 wasn't a complete mistake so that is a blunder. Why would you possibly play that ? Can someone answer me ? You lose a turn to bring your bishop ahead and then exchange it for a undeveloped knight. Additionaly he allows my black squared bishop to open his diagonal and threaten c3 and put pressure on b2 and a1} Bxf6 7. Nf3 d6 8. Nd5 {This move is obviously a mistake. He wants to have the possibility of Bc7 but doesn't see that Bxb2} Bxb2 9. Rb1 Qa5+ {Of course I don't retreat immediately. White's mistakes give me a oppurtunity to attack the uncastled king.} 10. Nd2 {Only possible move if he wants to castle in the future.} Bd4 {I retreat but not fully. My bishop is still in a good position, but White's chances to castle and put an end to my attack are big.} 11. f3 {Another mistake. I don't have an idea what's the purpose of this move. He opens my black squared and makes his castling very complicated. } e6 {I eliminate the danger of Bc7 i order to make my attack easier.} 12. Nf4 {he retreats to the ony possible position and } Qxa2 {I win another pawn.} 13. Ne2 {Well that is another move I don't like. He leaves the pawn on d3 without any support and tries without having enough power to force my bishop to retreat.} Be3 {As I said - not enough support} 14. Nb3 Nb4 {I involve my kight in the attack in order to have more power and to push him for Bc7#} 15. Na1 Bd2+ {I decide that is it time to attack and force the king to move from his hide place} 16. Kf2 Nxd3+ {The unsupported d3 pawn helps me to continue my attack and bring the king further away.} 17. Kg3 {only possible move because of Be3#} h5 {Here I need to bring another figure in the attack and the h7 pawn is ideal for it.} 18. Nc2 {White's last mistake. Not so bad as a move but only when the king isn't near mate. I mean the knight does nothing to help the king of escaping the dangoures situation. A possibly better move is h4 which would at least give the king a chance to survive.} h4+ {Predictable and leading in any way to checkmate.} 19. Kh3 {the other possibility leads to Kg4	e5#} Nf2# {The thing which I've learned from this game is always to be concentrated because every move can be a step to a win but also to a loss.}
