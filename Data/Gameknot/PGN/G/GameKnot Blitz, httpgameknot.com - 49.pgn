1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. Nf3 h6 {Avoiding Ng5. Not the most aggressive move.} 4. d4 d6 5. O-O Nf6 6. Nc3 {Pretty normal looking game so far. White has the lead in development.} Be7 7. d5 Nd4 {? loses a pawn.} 8. Nxd4 exd4 9. Qxd4 {White has a pawn to the good and seems to be ahead in development.} O-O 10. Qd3 {Not sure why I did this move. It just felt right.} a6 11. a4 c6 {Attempting to weaken the center for white.} 12. f4 cxd5 {Attempting to develop to gain some initiative. } 13. Nxd5 Nh7 14. f5 Bf6 {I am eyeing black's kingside as it may become cut off from the center if I can land my pawn on f6 or cause other mayhem. } 15. Rb1 {?! Wasn't sure what to do. This seemed like a non-stupid move to do.} Bd7 16. Qg3 b5 17. axb5 Bxb5 {Forcing the trade of the bishops.} 18. Bxb5 axb5 19. Bxh6 {!? Wins a pawn.} Re8 20. Rf4 {This is where things become interesting.} Bg5 {Forcing the trade of bishops.} 21. Bxg5 Qxg5 22. Rg4 Qh6 23. Rf1 {Need the rook to push f6.} Nf6 {? Not a good choice. Seems smart but leaves black open for an attack.} 24. Rxg7+ {! Now black is in trouble.} Qxg7 {This may not have been the best choice to refute the attack. } 25. Nxf6+ Kf8 26. Nd7+ Kg8 27. Nf6+ {?! I wasn't sure what to do and needed a moment to think. So I repeated the moves to see if any other moves were possible.} Kf8 28. Qxd6+ {! This seems to be the correct line.} Re7 {Forced.} 29. Nd7+ Ke8 30. f6 {Black is done. 30. ... Rxd7 31. Qe5+ Kf8 32. fxg7+ Kg8. Also. 30. ... Rxd7 31. fxg7 Rxd6 32. g8=Q+ Ke7 33. Qxh8 is also winning. } Qxf6 31. Nxf6+ Kf8 32. Nh7+ Kg7 33. Qxe7 Ra1 {Suicidal move. } 34. Qxf7+ {Black proceeded to use the next 7 minutes of his time to timeout in true blitz fashion.}
