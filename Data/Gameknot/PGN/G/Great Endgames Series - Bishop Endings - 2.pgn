1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bg5 O-O 6. e3 Nbd7 7. Qc2 c6 8. a3 Re8 9. Rd1 Nf8 10. Bd3 dxc4 11. Bxc4 Nd5 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 13. O-O b6 14. Rdc1 Bb7 15. Bd3 Rec8 16. Nxd5 exd5 17. Bf5 Rc7 18. b4 g6 19. Bd3 Ne6 20. Qb2 Rac8 21. Be2 c5 22. bxc5 bxc5 23. dxc5 Nxc5 24. Qb4 Ne6 25. Qxe7 Rxe7 26. Rxc8+ Bxc8 27. Rc1 Rc7 28. Rxc7 Nxc7 29. Nd4 Bd7 30. Kf1 Kf8 31. Ke1 Ke7 32. Kd2 Kd6 33. Kc3 f6 34. Kb4 Be8 35. Bb5 Bf7 36. a4 Be6 37. Nb3 Bc8 38. Nd4 Be6 39. Bd3 Bd7 40. h4 Ne6 41. Bb5 Nxd4 42. exd4 Bc8 {Yanofsky notes that the game was adjourned in this position, and the other competitors in the tournament all thought it was drawn. However, by very fine play, Yanofsky proves otherwise. White has the advantage of the more active king and the better bishop, principally because of the black pawn on d5, which blocks in his own prelate. Black also has two of his kingside pawns on white squares, and Yanofsky hurries to capitalize on this. The first stage of his plan is to fix all three black kingside pawns on light squares ..} 43. Bd3 f5 {Coming rather quietly, but Yanofsky argues that the move is practically forced anyway. The threat is g2-g3, followed by h4-hS. Black can try to bring his bishop over, to defend the kingside pawns, but then he allows the white king into a6, when the a-pawn or dpawn will fall. Yanofsky gives the variation 43. ... Bd7 44. g3 Be8 45. Bb5 Bf7 46. Ka5 Kc7 47. Ka6 Kb8 48. a5 and Black is close to zugzwang. 48. ..g5 (48. ...Ka8 49 Bc6+ Kb8 50. Bb5, followed by Kc5, wins the d-pawn)  49. f4 (in view of the next note, 49. Bd3 h6 50. Bb5 and Kc5 is simpler)  49 ... h6 (the computer points out 49 ... gxh4! 50 gxh4 Bg6! which probably draws, as White's king gets stuck on a6) and now 50. Ba4! is the full "Volkswagen", as Nigel Short calls it: 50. ...Be6 51. Be8! followed by Kb5-c5.} 44. f4 {Immediately fixing the pawns on light squares.} Be6 45. g3 Bd7 46. Bb5 {At present, the black bishop is ideally placed on d7, from where it is able to swing over to either wing. White's main plan is to play h4-h5, but if he prepares that with 46. Be2, then Black has 46. ...Be8. Yanofsky therefore drives the enemy bishop off its ideal square, forcing it to choose an inferior post.} Bc8 {Black chooses to maintain the guard of a6, but now the bishop loses the chance to come to e8, defending the other wing. If instead 46. ...Be6, keeping the option of coming to f7, then White moves in on the queenside instead: 47. Ka5 Kc7 48. Ka6 Kb8 49. Be8 as in the note to move 43.} 47. Be2 {With the enemy bishop no longer able to reach the e8-h5 diagonal, White can now prepare his h4-h5 break.} Kc6 {47 ... h5 would obviously create a fatal weakness on g6, and after 48. Bb5 there would already be no way to avoid loss of material, in view of the threat Be8. The king and pawn ending is of course lost after 48. ...Bd7 49. Bxd7 Kxd7 50. Kc5 Ke6 51. Kc6.} 48. h5 gxh5 {If Black does not capture, White will have a pleasant choice between exchanging pawns, creating a fatal weakness on g6, or pushing on to h6. The latter creates various tactical threats involving the promotion of the h-pawn, for example 48. ...Be6 49. h6 Bc8? 50. Bb5+ Kd6 51. Be8 and there is no defence to the threat of Bxg6.} 49. Bxh5 {Now Black has a further weakness on f5.} Kb6 50. a5+ Kc6 {Yanofsky points out that 50. ...Ka6 leads to a comic state of helplessness for Black after 51. Bf7 Bb7 52. Be6.} 51. Be8+ Kd6 52. Kb5 {White is gradually able to inch into the enemy camp.} Ke7 53. Bh5 Kd6 54. Be2 Bb7 55. Bd3 Bc8 56. Bc2 {Zugzwang again. The king cannot move without allowing the white king into c5, the bishop cannot go to b7 because the f5-pawn drops, and if the bishop moves to d7 or e6, it allows the white king into a6. There is only one other move.} h6 57. Bd3 {But that only staves off the moment of truth by one move. Now Black must make a concession.} Bd7+ 58. Ka6 Kc7 59. Kxa7 Bc8 {Black has been forced to surrender a pawn. He tries to make things difficult, by boxing in the white king, but once again zugzwang defeats him.} 60. Bc2 h5 {This condemns another pawn to oblivion, but if 60. ...Be6 61. Ka6 Kc6 then White frees his king by means of 62. Ba4+.} 61. Bd1 Kc6 62. Ba4+ {62. Bxh5 Kb5 63 a6 would also have won (63 ...Bxa6? 64. Be2+), but Yanofsky prefers not even to allow Black that forlorn hope of counterplay.} Kc7 63. Be8 Be6 64. a6 {Megabase gives the final move as 64 Ka6, but Yanofsky's own book gives the text. Either way, the position is obviously hopeless for Black. After 64 a6, Yanofsky gives the further line 64. ...Bc8 65. Bxh5 Be6 66. Bg6 Bc8 67. Bf7 Kc6 68. Bg8! with another zugzwang. The pawn promotes after 68. ...Kd6 69. Kb6. A splendid piece of precision play by the Canadian Champion, who was a noted endgame expert. His best game collection (alas, a bibliographical rarity these days) contains a number of finely played endgames, and can be highly recommended.}
