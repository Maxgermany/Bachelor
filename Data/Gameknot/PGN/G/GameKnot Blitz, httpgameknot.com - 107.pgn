Nh3 {I'm going for g5 square whit my knight, if my opponent choose to block it with h6, I have possibility to play my knight to f4. } d6 {Making room for LB.} 7. Ng5 {Nice position for my knight :).} Be6 {OK let do some exchange....} 8. Nxe6 fxe6 9. Bxe6 {Here i gained material back, and place my LB to a very dangerous position.} Qe7 10. Qb3 {It is time to take the White lady to action.} d5 {? I think my opponent try to isolate my LB, but he gave me a chance to support him whit my e pawn.} 11. exd5 {Dangerous position for me, because my LB is now pinned to white King. But not so dangerous, if he take my pawn whit his knight, white lady will come even more closer to black King, and his knight is lost for a pawn.} Na5 {Ops here comes the pain :)} 12. Qb5+ Nd7 {Nice, I don't have to worry about my pawn on d5 anymore :)} 13. Qxa5 {...so I take his free knight} b6 {OK I will move my Queen to a better place ;) } 14.

Qc6 {...now she is in very good place - for me ;)} Rd8 {yes, yes, take care of your rook, but whit this move, the King is in a very tight place...} 16. O-O {Time to unpin my bishop, and bring my rook into action... } h6 {? wasted move.} 17. Re1 {Now his Queen is pinned, and double check is on horizon, if he move her.} Qh4 {Well he did move her, and put me into a mate threat, but I'm on the move, and I have a mate already prepared :)} 18. Bxd7+ {Mr. King move to f7 please...} Kf7 {Thank you :)} 19. Qe6# {And it's over :). Nice game (for me), and if you see, my Queen side is totally undeveloped. Have a nice day.}
