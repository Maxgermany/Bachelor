1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 {Nothing too unusual except the choice in opening by white.} 4. Bc4 d6 {I feel like there could have been an attack on f7 looming. Comment please as I do not play Nf6 for quite some time.} 5. O-O Be7 6. d4 Nc6 7. Qe1 Bg4 8. c3 {Necessary to defend d4. Although playing d5 seems like an interesting idea too for white.} Bxf3 9. Rxf3 Nf6 10. e5 {I had an "oh crud" moment here, but lo! There was something in story! An attack perhaps?} dxe5 11. dxe5 Bc5+ 12. Kh1 Ng4 {Suddenly it is white who is underdeveloped! What on earth happened? Last I checked black was the one who needed development! } 13. e6 {Is this White's best line? Comments please :)} Nce5 14. exf7+ Kf8 15. Be3 {?! This loses an entire rook. I don't think this is the best choice.} Nxe3 16. Rxe3 Bxe3 17. Na3 Ng4 18. h3 Nf2+ 19. Kh2 g4 20. Qe2 {A good choice...except for} g3+ 21. Kg1 Nxh3+ 22. Kh1 {?? Kf1 gives White a tiny chance of survival instead of instant death.} Qh4 {Thanks for reading this far! This was an okay game despite the lack of annotations. Feel free to contribute in comments!!}
