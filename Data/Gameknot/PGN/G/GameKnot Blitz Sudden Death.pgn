1. e4 d5 {Learned a new thing from this opening; try not to lose your queen if possible.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 e6 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Bd3 {White's opening at this point is solid, I should have stepped up how aggressive I was.} Be7 7. Bd2 O-O 8. O-O Qb6 {? I'm behind in development, what is the point of moving my queen again?} 9. Rb1 Nc6 {?? This loses my queen in an amateur fashion!} 10. Na4 {At this point I woke up and realized I'm in some deep trouble.} Qxd4 11. Nxd4 Nxd4 {I almost resigned at this point. Sometimes though, it only seems right to make someone earn his win. I've lost at this point.} 12. Bg5 h6 13. Bxf6 {Trading off the material to make his material advantage stronger.} Bxf6 14. c3 Nc6 {Still nothing going for me...maybe I should think of something to do?} 15. Nc5 b6 16. Ne4 Be7 {At this point I'm wondering how my opponent is going to attack and if I should go super aggressive since my endgame will be rough.} 17. Qf3 Bb7 18. Qg3 {Getting his queen into play. Really though I think he should move his pieces forward since he's +5.} Rac8 19. f3 f5 {An aggressive move that leaves a weakpoint at e6. At this point losing a pawn is not so bad, what I'm worried about is losing control of my kingside.} 20. Nf2 Bd6 {Bc5 gets kicked out by b4 and is not really a threat since I'm unwilling to exchange minor pieces.} 21. Qh4 Ne5 {At this point my position is better as I have control but it is still imbalanced. } 22. Bc2 {? Be2 would have been a better choice since I can now do...} Bxf3 {! This complicates the game but strengthens my position.} 23. Nh3 {23. gxf3?? Nxf3+ 24. Kh1 Nxh4. I would have targeted e6 with Bb3. Maybe that is a little better.} Bg4 {Maybe it was better to keep him on the long diagonal as it gives the white king more pressure. Comment if it seems better.} 24. Nf4 {Maneuvering his knight into position. The main problem is that his pieces are not working together, there needs to be more cooperation and less passivity. } Rf6 25. h3 {?! This opens up the kingside which is advantageous for me.} g5 {My threat is more prevailing since he must move his queen.} 26. Qg3 gxf4 {Again, my threat is stronger.} 27. Rxf4 Ng6 {At last I get to use my discover attack! Setting those things up remind me of loading a shotgun, I'm not sure why.} 28. hxg4 Bxf4 {Material is now equal. My pieces are better placed though, but my king is somewhat open as his pawns are gone. } 29. Qh3 {At this point I felt good about my position. It was workable and my rooks could protect my king from his limited protection if I kept my minor pieces busy.} Rcf8 30. g3 Bg5 {Be3+ is unneccesary. His king is good where it is at.} 31. gxf5 exf5 32. Rf1 {At this point Ne7 seems like the only move.} f4 {!? The final battle. My f pawn advances instead of putting my knight into the 7th rank. He is just what I need to finish off the kingside protection. 33. Bxg6 Rxg6 34. gxf4 Bxg4+ and my position looks OK. My analysis was not solid at this point, it just seemed like the right stab.} 33. gxf4 Nxf4 {Now things are cooking. I am threatening Ne2+/Nh3+ followed by Rxf1+ so his queen must protect both squares.} 34. Qg4 Kh8 {Removing the pin. Ne2+/Nh3+ leaves us with a different colored bishop draw. At least now he is the one fighting for a draw! I was playing with the idea of 35. ... h5 36. Qxg5 Nh3+} 35. Rxf4 {?? The position cannot take this and he does not have the material to sacrifice. Maybe he was hoping to land his queen on h7 but that will not work because of...} Rf6xf4 36. Qh3 {...my threat to take his bishop! Rf1+ followed by R1f2+. His queen must defend f1!} Rf4f3 {! I don't give myself exclamation marks lightly, in general my moves aren't worthy of them but this is the final blow. The bishop is lost and he now needs to fight for perpetual check, g2 is the only square to defend the bishop but that is not good because...} 37. Qg2 Be3+ {And the game is over.} 38. Kh1 Rf3f1+ 39. Kh2 Rf1f2 {0-1. A solid victory from a shattered opening. Even minor pieces and rooks can work together to overcome royalty. What did we learn? If you have a high advantage in material stay in the game you may have not won just yet...}
