1. d4 {This was a non rated Grunfeld Defense game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my friend Ananya (ananyapathak). Ananya, here is a quote from our previous game: "According to MCO, the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality, and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. ..." So since I won with the White side, I intentionally played the Grunfeld as Black to see how I can handle the other side. This is the first time playing the Black side of this defense.} Nf6 { } 2. c4 { } g6 { } 3. Nc3 { } d5 { } 4. cxd5 { } Nxd5 { } 5. e4 { } Nxc3 6. bxc3 {So Ananya, as I mentioned, I chose to play the Black side of the Grunfeld Defense, Exchange Variation, to see how I do against you since I played the same from the White side previously. So here you have the pawn center we spoke of in the last game. Your game plan should be to maintain your strong pawn center. My game plan is to undermine your pawn center. } Bg7 {My attack on your pawns begins with this move, same as you did as black.} 7. Ne2 { } c5 { } 8. Be3 { } Qa5 { } 9. Qd2 { } O-O { } 10. h3 { } cxd4 {In order to weaken the White pawn storm, PxP is usually necessary.} 11. cxd4 { } Qxd2+ { } 12. Bxd2 { } Nc6 { } 13. Bc3 { } Rd8 { } 14. d5 {I would have suggested further defending the d-pawn. You could have played 14. Rd1, removing the rook from the deadly a1-h8 diagonal. If you choose later to play d5, it would be safer because the rook is not on that line of fire. The move you chose here enabled my strong knight move (14. ... Nb4!).} Nb4 {The knight cannot safely be taken on b4 as 15. BxR looses the exchange (as we played in the actual game). I think the best move is 15. BxB. I would not fork your king and rook, because after NxR you play BxN. You would have gotten a bishop and knight for a rook, a better deal for you. Instead I would play KxB, then I still have the Knight threat.} 15. Bxb4 { } Bxa1 { } 16. Bxe7 {Ananya, you may have felt justified in losing the exchange, in order to get the passed d-pawn advanced to the 6th rank. When I looked at this line, I eagerly played it because it gave me a material advantage and I could not see a way for you to force the pawn any further, after I put my bishop on d7 and rook on e8. Since you were way behind in development, you bishop and rook would take a long time to back the pawn up. I was sure I'd come out on top and in a worst case scenario, I'd always be able to give up the exchange via RxB, then win the pawn back on e7. This would make us even steven again. As it turned out I was able to win the bishop, knight and d-pawn in exchange for the rook! Pretty nice exchange rate! Better than the U.S. dollar!} Re8 { } 17. d6 { } Kg7 {In an attempt to trade off your DSB, I planned to play Bf6. Once we trade DSB's, it would be easier to attack the d-pawn. As it turned out, (though not in my plan at this point) the king on g7 was also needed to get your knight. See move 22.} 18. Nf4 { } Bc3+ {When you put your knight here on f4, I changed my mind about Bf6. I felt the bishop was more needed on the a5-d8 diagonal, to threaten the bishop trade via Bd8 and to prevent Nd5, then Nc7. If you got your knight to c7, RxB does not work as well as it did in the game, because I can't get the knight. At this point after the night move, I saw your threat of Nd5 then Nf6. So, I planned on how to deal with that, as you saw in the game.} 19. Kd1 { } Bd7 { This square was the only one available to move the bishop, (since I would not want you to play NxB if I play Be6. That would weaken my pawn structure). But more than that, the bishop was needed on d2, to prevent Bb5.} 20. Nd5 {As expected. } Ba4+ {At this stage in the game, the king is a fighting piece. So I made this move to limit your king's mobility. His only options are Kc1 where he is stuck for now on the back rank, or Ke2, where he temporarily blocks in your bishop.} 21. Ke2 Ba5 {So this is to prevent Nc7, to see if you'd play Nf6(???).} 22. Nf6 {(???) You did it! This move looks aggressive, but it allows me to gain too much material. I gain a bishop, a knight and a pawn (a value of 7 points). You gain a rook (5 points). All I needed to do is 22. ... RxB, removing the knight's defense, 23. PxR KxN. Then you can't defend the pawn, and if you push the pawn to promote, I play RxQ, bringing all of my pieces into play. You were already down the exchange and could not afford to lose any more material. You were also behind in development, and could not afford to help mine.} Rxe7 {Here we go!} 23. dxe7 Kxf6 24. e8=Q {You'd be better off making me take with my king. When you promote the pawn you force me to take with my remaining rook, completing my development. I appreciated that. ;-)} Rxe8 { } 25. f3 { } Ke5 {The king is a fighter. } 26. Kf2 { } Bb6+ {Again, I'm trying to further limit your king's mobility.} 27. Kg3 { } Kd4 { } 28. Kg4 { } Bc7 {Limiting your king further. The g3 square is no longer available!} 29. Kg5 { } Be5 {Now you can go take the h2 pawn. Then Rh8 is mate.} 30. f4 f6+ 31. Kg4 Bd7+ 32. Kf3 Bd6 {You resigned. Though I don't see an immediate mate threat, there was no way to defend your e-pawn.  ******************************************************************** Good game, Ananya! Glad to play you!}
