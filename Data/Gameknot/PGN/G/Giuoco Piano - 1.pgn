1. e4 {I don't make many errors in this game, but my first one is enough to finish me off, the others being incidental. An interesting variant of the Italian game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. O-O Nf6 {Castling, instead of playing 4.c3 obviously invites an attack on the e-pawn.} 5. d4 {White doesn't defend the attacked pawn, but goes straight on the attack. Clearly 5...Nxd4 loses the e-pawn; 5...Bb6 seems unnecesarily passive; 5...exd5, I learn, leads to the Max Lange Attack, which I do not fancy facing, so...} Bxd4 {This seems to give Black the most winning chances, at least according to the database!} 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 {The Knight can easily be driven away, but for now White's e-pawn is attacked.} 7. f4 {Once again White leaves defence for later and continues to attack. In a way it's a great demonstration of how to utilise having the first move; Black is continually on the back foot, so to speak.} d6 {Defending the pawn and renewing the attack on the e-pawn. We're still comfortably in the database with Black having the best of the games.} 8. fxe5 dxe5 9. Bg5 {Now this is a really wicked move. The analysis has me slightly ahead, but it's clear that White is going to disrupt my K-side pawns at some point, the only plus being that if he does I will have an open file against his King.} Be6 {Inviting an exchange that will allow me to return my Knight from its outpost before it's attacked. the more popular database move, 9...Qe7, was probably better.} 10. Na3 {My dark-squared Bishop has gone, so I can't punish this by doubling and isolating White's pawns. Not is it there to interpose on e7. Maybe allowing the Max Lange attack was safer?} Bxc4 {I certainly don't want too much pressure on f7 so I exchange.} 11. Nxc4 {The computer has the game level, but I'm not convinced, despite White's isolated pawn. My Knight is pinned, my e-pawn is attacked and White has open files for his Rook and Queen. And I haven't castled. It may be just as well, as those K-side pawns are going to get messed up.} Qe7 {In the meantime I defend my pawn.} 12. Bxf6 {Here it comes...} gxf6 {At least I have an open file of my own to attack down.} 13. c3 {White dislodges my sole advanced piece.} Ne6 {I'm driven away, but I can attack g2 via f4 from here.} 14. b4 {I'm unsure of the point of this move, unless it's to prevent my Knight going to c5? I'm surprised, actually, that we are still in the database.} Nf4 15. Kh1 {I suppose I'd hoped for 15.g3, to allow my Knight to go to h3.} Rg8 {At this point, the only remaining game has a continuation of 15...Qe6, attacking the Knight, but I want to get my Rook onto the open file as quickly as possible. Significantly, this is where the analysis has the turning point of the game.} 16. Ne3 {Defending g7. } c6 {In another line, White attacked with the Queen via a4, so I decide to prevent that check.} 17. Qa4 {I'm surprised to see that White still plays the Queen here; I have quite missed its significance.} Nd3 {I'm still building up against g2 and miss the deadly threat...} 18. Nd5 {Of course, now the Knight has moved, White's Knight is allowed here; the c-pawn is pinned and the horrible fork on f6 is unavoidable. I'm doomed already.} Qd6 19. Nxf6+ Ke7 20. Nxg8+ Rxg8 {I decide that I'll get the other Rook on the open file even if it does allow White to pinch my a-pawn.} 21. Rad1 {White has no intention of going pawn hunting though, pinning my Knight instead. I have a few rather hopeful threats left...} Qg6 {He's not going to take the Knight, obviously.} 22. Qc2 Nf4 23. g3 {Any hope of a win on g2 has gone and I should look to whatever defence I can muster, retreating to e6.} Nh3 {Defence, though, will simply entail a slightly longer game!} 24. Rf5 {The attack, when it comes now, is swift!} f6 25. Qd2 Ng5 {Too late I see the danger and return the Knight, but there's no escapeing...} 26. Qd6+ Kf7 27. Qc7+ Kf8 28. Rd8+ {It's mate soon and I resign. Even without my first error I was in trouble, and this is an opening line for me to watch out for!}
