Qd4 Qxd4 50. Rxd4 Kg7 51. a5 Ra6 52. Rd5 Rf6 53. Rd4 Ra6 {This is the textbook demonstration of how to exploit an extra, outside passed pawn in a rook ending, with the stronger side's rook behind the passed pawn. If the white rook were on a6 and the black rook on a4, the game would be a draw, although it is not as easy to defend as once thought, as mentioned in the next example, but as it is, White is winning by force. The ending is also of great historical significance, because this was game 34 of the AlekhineCapablanca world championship match. Alekhine led 5-3 in decisive games, needing six wins to take the world title, so this was the endgame which dethroned the great "invincible" Cuban and gave the chess world its fourth world champion.} 54. Ra4 {The vital first step. The rook takes up position behind its passed pawn. Now the black rook is tied to a6, else the white pawn will advance, whilst the white rook can make tempo moves back down the a-file, as required. White's plan is as follows:  1. Bring his king over towards the pawn. The black king will have to stand in opposition, to prevent the white king reaching b5 and forcing the advance of the pawn. 2. Once the kings stand in opposition, a waiting move by the white rook will force the black king to give way; either it allows its opposite number into b5, or into the kingside (two weaknesses!}.} Kf6 55. Kf3 Ke5 56. Ke3 h5 {I have always thought it curious that, although this ending has been examined in almost every major endgame textbook, this move has hardly ever been commented upon. Yet it is open to the objection that it weakens the square g5 and so allows the white king an avenue via this square into black's kingside pawns, as indeed occurs later in the game. It therefore seems logical to suggest 56. ...Kd5, keeping the pawn on h6.   By a curious coincidence, just as this book was being written, German endgame expert Dr Karsten Muller devoted one of his Chess Cafe endgame columns to an examination of this very move, prompted by  analysis supplied by a German amateur, Erich Korber. The full analysis is too extensive to reproduce here, and can be found in Muller's column anyway, but the conclusion is that White still wins. The main line of the analysis immediately exploits Black's failure to play 56 ...h5, as follows: 57. h5 Ke6 (or 57. ...g5 58. f4 gxf4+ 59. Kxf4 and White's king invades the kingside, rather as in the final phase of the game continuation) 58. hxg6 fxg6 and White will now be able to create another passed pawn, this time on the  king side.  Just as in the game, Black will not be able to hold both fronts: 59. f4 h5 60. Kd4 Kd6 61. Ra3! and White wins in similar fashion to the game: his king will either penetrate on the queenside and support the apawn, or will attack the kingside pawns, supported at the crucial moment by a switch of his rook. Readers wishing to see the complete analysis should visit www.chesscafe.com, and look up the Karsten Muller article "News on a classical rook endgame", dated 19 October 2011.} 57. Kd3 Kd5 58. Kc3 Kc5 {Step one has been accomplished.} 59. Ra2 {Step 2. Black's king must give way.} Kb5 {59 ... 'it>ds? 60 ÙÄÅ¶b4 obviously loses much more quickly.} 60. Kb3 {Before advancing his king, White repeats moves.} Kc5 61. Kc3 Kb5 62. Kd4 {Continuing the next stage of the plan. Now the white king will mount a raid on the black kingside pawns,  and seek to establish a decisive material advantage on that side of the board. As usual, Black cannot take the a-pawn, because the resulting king and pawn ending would be hopeless, so his only defensive idea is to "change the guard" on the queenside; the king will occupy a6, blocking the passed pawn, and the black rook will endeavour to hold off the white king.} Rd6+ 63. Ke5 Re6+ 64. Kf4 Ka6 65. Kg5 Re5+ 66. Kh6 Rf5 {For the time being, Black has achieved his best possible defensive formation. His king holds up the passed pawn, whilst his rook defends the kingside pawns. However, as so often, zugzwang will prove to be the straw that breaks the camel's back} 67. f4 {"Do not hurry!" Alekhine is here guilty of breaking that cardinal rule, and although it does not imperil the win, it does make it harder. I am sure a Rubinstein or an Ulf Andersson would have played the precise zugzwang finish 67. Kg7! Rf3 68. Kf8! Rf5 69. Kg8! Triangulation. 69. ...Rf3 (or 69. ...Rf6 70. f4 Rf5 71. Kg7) 70. Kg7! Rf5 71. f4 and Black must lose a pawn.} Rc5 {Seizing his chance to re-position the rook onto the second rank, where he has enough squares to avoid zugzwang.} 68. Ra3 {68 ...Rc3 was a threat.} Rc7 69. Kg7 Rd7 {Now we can see that White has complicated things. His rook has lost much of its mobility, because of the need to defend g3, whilst the black rook has plenty of squares on the second rank and cannot be driven into zugzwang. Fortunately, White still has another way of breaking the enemy resistance - undermining his kingside pawn structure with a pawn break.} 70. f5 {This is the key idea. Black must capture, after which the h-pawn falls and his remaining kingside pawns are weak.} gxf5 71. Kh6 f4 {71. ...Rd5 was another defensive try, but then 72. Kg5! (72 Kxh5? f4+) 72. ...Rc5 73. Kf6 Rd5 74. Kxf7 f4 (passive play also loses, e.g. 74. ...Rc5 75. Kf6 Rd5 76. Rf3! etc.) 75. gxf4 Rf5+ 76. Kg6 Rxf4 77. Kxh5 and wins.} 72. gxf4 Rd5 73. Kg7 Rf5 74. Ra4 Kb5 {Clearly, the only hope.} 75. Re4 {The decisive switch to the kingside. The a-pawn will fall, but the black king is too far away to avoid  devastation on the opposite flank.} Ka6 {7S ...Kxa5? 76. Re5+ is immediately decisive.} 76. Kh6 Rxa5 {Black could still pose practical problems by 76 ...Kb7 77. Re7+ Ka6 78. Re5 Rxf4 79. Kxh5 f6, although the tablebase confirms that White is winning with the transfer of his rook to the hfile by 80. Re3 Ka5 81. Rh3 etc.} 77. Re5 Ra1 78. Kxh5 Rg1 79. Rg5 Rh1 80. Rf5 Kb6 81. Rxf7 Kc6 82. Re7 {Of course, many endings with this material distribution are theoretically drawn, but not with the black king cut off so far away.}
