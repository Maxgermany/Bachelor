1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 f6 {!?  Apparently this is a well known and dubious opening for black where white can safely capture the pawn as its recapture creates havoc worse than losing a pawn.  After seeing the point of the commenters, I think I have to say I was wrong about this game being interesting.  In my small defense, it is a blitz game, and I had never seen this opening before.  Forced into the line Shredder (2600) continues against itself 3... Ne7 4.Nc4 d5 5.exd5 Nxe5 6.Nc3 c6} 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. c3 {Looking forward to trying to exploit g5 and a bishop or knight on b4 would complicate things.  As to the question of 4.Nxe5, I think we have to put it in a gambit category, but unfortunately I answered the wrong question.  3.Nxe5 cannot be considered a gambit as no_genius illustrates with his example of an annotation with it.    I tried looking this position up in the database and was surprised to see that the position here has not only occurred in a rated games setting but occurred fairly frequently ordered below by frequency of occurrence by players where one player is 1600+.  There are even some 1900+ rated players who missed the force of 3.Nxe5.} Na5 {Okay, I got it.  I missed the original threat.  Seeing it now I have to think that had both players recognized it after the original opportunity play might have proceeded.  I originally said, "This really does eliminate many of the ideas around g5 and f7," and nuntar adds the following lines as winning for white, and I must congratulate him on his analysis: 5.Nxe5! [A] 5... fxe5 6. Qh5+ [A1]6...Ke7 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Qd5+ [A2]6... g6 7. Qxe5+ forking knight and rook. [B] 6... Ke7 then 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Qd5+ also picks up the knight, as well as putting Black's king in a horrible position;  [C] 5... Nxc4 6. Qh5+  [C1] 6... Ke7 7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Nxc4+ Kc5 (or Kc6) 9. Qd5# "with a nice mid-board mate." [C2] 6... g6 7. Nxg6 which Nuntar assesses as "clearly wins"  All his analysis is spot on for except for his assesment of C2 which is a touch too optimistic but correctly picks white as winning.  The probable continuation --courtesy of iPod Touch's Shredder as 2600 (I cheated)-- point to white as winning:  [C2a] 8.Qxg8 Kf7 9.Qh7+ Bg7 10.f4 Ne7 11.d3 f5 12.Qh8 Where white's pawn structure is superior and black's pieces have been compelled to non-optimal squares.  When the Queen's come off the board, Black will have the bishop pair and both knights.  White will have both rooks, a pawn advantage, a good center and the choice of placing his bishop and knight on squares of his choosing, and an exposed black king.} 5. Qa4 Nxc4 6. Qxc4 {And the position is interesting.} Bd6 {Odd.  Perhaps he expects the d4 push when exchanges would place the bishop with decent scope, but I really have not committed to it yet.} 7. d4 {But, I decide that Bb4+ is no threat and the king can make it to safely rather easily.} a6 {He decides to expel the Queen but more effective is exd4 clearing a diagonal for the bishop.  Additionally there are complications that arise and White can maintain the queen in good position for several more moves.} 8. dxe5 b5 {Given preparation, this would have been a good move.} 9. Qd5 {Black is forced to drop a piece.  Black can choose either bishop or the rook.  Probably most natural is Rb8, but after exd6 black will have trouble controlling d6.}
