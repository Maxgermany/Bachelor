1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Nothing that I'm not used to.} Bf5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 e6 {Oddly enough this position is very similar to the blitz game I played where I beat a 1700.} 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Bxf6 gxf6 {Taking with his queen would lose a pawn.} 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. e3 a6 9. Bd3 {Still showing similarities to the 1700 game.} Bg4 10. h3 Bh5 11. Qe2 {Allows kingside or queenside castling.} Bb4 12. a3 Bxc3+ {I wonder if this was worth it... It brings my pawn closer to the center and gives me a half open file that I send an attack down later and it gives up his bishop for a knight but it does isolate my pawn.} 13. bxc3 Qe7 14. Rb1 O-O-O {Maybe, just maybe he castled into it.} 15. Qb2 Na5 16. Bf5+ {Pining his b pawn.} Kb8 17. Bd3 {Now I threaten Bxa6. I think white might have the edge here.} Rd6 18. Nd2 Rb6 {! Defuses my attack.} 19. Qc2 Rxb1+ 20. Qxb1 Bg6 {! Prevents Bxa6 by pinning it to my queen and forcing a trade.} 21. Bxg6 fxg6 22. O-O {Putting my king to safety and getting my other rook into the game.} Qxa3 {But as it turns out o-o was an oversight that dropped a pawn. It is very difficult for me to last against such a high rated player where a tiny inaccuracy can be punished.} 23. Rc1 {Thinking about renewing my attack.} Nc4 {? I don't think this is good, it removed a defender of the b pawn, and it allows doubled pawns and it trades a good knight for a passive one.} 24. Nxc4 dxc4 25. Rc2 {I believe that black has only a slight edge.} b5 26. Ra2 Qxc3 {? I don't like this, it allows me to trade pawns and allow the b pawn to be undefended.} 27. Rxa6 Qb3 28. Qa1 {Now the h file is where my attack is located.} Kb7 29. Ra7+ Kc6 30. Qa6+ {Wins back my pawn.} Kd7 31. Rb7 {I could have taken his pawn, I could have moved my queen to b7 threatening Qxc7+, but I think this is best. It threatens Rxb5 which would attack his queen, and it also allows my queen to possible double up behind the rook. } Qa4 32. Qxb5+ {I think this trade was in my best interests but it was a hard decision. } Qxb5 33. Rxb5 Ra8 {!} 34. Rc5 Ra1+ 35. Kh2 Rc1 36. Kg3 Kd6 37. Kf4 {My rook is doing a good job of confining his king.} c6 38. g4 {Waiting move mostly.} c3 {His c pawn is no threat as my rook prevents his king from coming to its aid.} 39. e4 c2 {I almost played e5+?? here, before realizing that after fxe5+ I'd be in BIG trouble.} 40. Ke3 {My king comes over to win his pawn.} Re1+ 41. Kd2 Rxe4 42. Kd3 {!! This is what ensures that I'm not down by a pawn after this trade. I am very glad I found it as if I didn't I might have lost. Taking his pawn immediately would have allowed him to take my d pawn and make life very difficult for me.} f5 43. gxf5 gxf5 {Now both of our kingside pawns are isolated. It's looking like a draw.} 44. Rxc2 Rh4 45. Ke3 {Nothing I could do about him taking that pawn.} Rxh3+ 46. Kf4 Rh4+ 47. Kxf5 Rxd4 {Now I'm down by one but I think I have a good chance of drawing.} 48. Re2 h5 49. Kg5 h4 50. Re3 c5 51. Rh3 c4 {Taking his pawn would be crazy as after the rook trade there would be nothing to stop his pawn.} 52. f4 {So instead I play this.} Rd3 53. Rxh4 {No way would I have taken his rook there.} c3 54. Rh2 Rd2 55. Rh3 c2 56. Rc3 {Now with my rook behind his pawn he can't promote until his king gets down there. Meanwhile I am pushing my pawn...} Kd5 57. f5 Kd4 58. Rc8 {! Insures the draw.} Rg2+ 59. Kh6 Kd3 60. f6 Rh2+ 61. Kg7 Rg2+ 62. Kh8 Rf2 63. Kg7 Kd2 64. f7 {If he promotes then I capture his queen he takes my rook, I promote he takes my queen I take his rook and draw. } Rg2+ 65. Kf6 Rf2+ 66. Kg7 Rg2+ 67. Kf6 c1=Q {He accepts the draw.} 68. Rxc1 Kxc1 69. f8=Q Rf2+ 70. Kg7 Rxf8 71. Kxf8 {Good game nandrew! It was close the whole time! Please comment and rate.}
