[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {This was a tournament game, My opponent was the highest rated in the group and is one of the highest rated players that I have beaten, at the start of the tournament he was in the 1700's. For me one of the highlights of the game was a forced march down 3/4 the board by my opponents king to his ultimate demise.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {I've played the scandinavian with varied success against higher rated opponents, it seems to catch some of them out. This is the Lasker variation} 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. Bc4 e6 5. Qf3 {I haven't seen this move often but its still book, I'm not clear of the purpose of this move for white} c6 6. Nge2 Nf6 7. O-O Bd6 8. Ng3 {This takes us out of the gameknot database. Which only gives 8. d4 though I am sure that move is to come} O-O 9. Nh5 {This was a totally unexpected blunder, the analysis prefers  9. Nge4 Nxe4 10. Nxe4 Bc7 11. d4 Na6} Nxh5 10. Be2 Nf4 11. d4 {This seems to me to be to discourage Qe5 but I am looking to play Qc7 to add to the knights defence} Qc7 {I think with hindsight Nxe2 might have been better here} 12. Bxf4 Bxf4 {Being ahead in material I am more than happy to exchange. } 13. g3 Bd6 14. a3 b6 {looking to get my lsb on the h1-a8 diagonal} 15. Rad1 Nd7 16. Ne4 Be7 {Although I am happy to exchange I would like to keep my bishops as long as I am able} 17. b4 Bb7 18. Bd3 c5 19. c3 f5 {I'm not sure if white overlooked this but the computer didn't give any judgement at this point} 20. Qg2 fxe4 {Analysis declares this a mistake by black, though I am not at all clear why. The computer gives Mistake: +5.86 » … fxe4 21. Bxe4 Rab8 22. dxc5 Bxe4 23. Qxe4 Rf6 24. cxb6 Nxb6 25. Rd3 Nc4 26. f4 Nxa3 27. Rfd1 Qb6+ 28. Kg2 Qb7 29. Qxb7 Rxb7   The computer prefers Kh8 21. g4 cxb4 22. cxb4 Rac8 23. Kh1 fxe4 24. Bxe4 Ba6 25. Rfe1 Qf4 26. Bc6 Nf6 27. Rxe6 Qxg4 28. Qxg4 Nxg4 29. Rxe7 Rxc6} 21. Bxe4 Bxe4 {My strategy now is to simplify and try to not give white a chance to get back into the game} 22. Qxe4 cxb4 23. Qxe6+ Rf7 24. cxb4 Raf8 {This ties whites f rook to the defence of a pawn for now. The power of these rooks will become clear at the end of the game} 25. b5 {I dont understand this move at all, I was expecting white to push his passed pawn on d} Bxa3 {I'm happy to be greedy, whites pawn advantage is reducing which suits me} 26. Qb3 Bd6 27. Rdc1 Qb7 28. Rc6 Bb8 29. Re1 Kh8 {breaking the pin on my rook, white needs to decide how to defend his f pawn} 30. Re2 Nf6 {heading to g4 to pressure the f pawn} 31. Rce6 Ng4 32. Re6e8 Bd6 {This is a mistake, best is … Rxf2 33. Rxf2 Rxe8 34. Rf1 Nxh2 35. Qe6 Rc8 36. Qf7 Qxf7 37. Rxf7 Kg8 38. Rd7 Bxg3 39. Rxa7 Bb8 40. Rd7 Nf3+ 41. Kg2  At the time I wanted to avoid fxe8 and overlooked Rxf2 as an option} 33. f4 Nf6 {hoping to budge the rook} 34. Re8e6 Qd7 35. h3 Bb8 36. Qb4 Nd5 {I was quite pleased when I saw this, clearly the white queen can avoid the obvious threat, the real threat is bxf4, gxf4 forking the rooks} 37. Qb3 {I think I would have preferred Qa3 here, though the computer calls this a mistake preferring 37. Qe1 Bxf4 38. Re8 Bd6 39. Rxf8+ Rxf8} Bxf4 {I'm not sure that black could have prevented this} 38. gxf4 {probably best not to take, but what else can white do? According to the analysis his best option was 8. Kg2 Bxg3 39. Kxg3 Nf4 40. Re1 Qxd4 but to me that looks uncomfortable for white.} Nxf4 39. d5 {This is a blunder for white though I of course didn't see that, I wanted to avoid the pawn fork from nxe6, dxe6. The computer gives  Blunder: +24.16 » 39. d5 Nxe6 40. Qc4 Rf1+ 41. Kg2 Ng5 42. Qd3 R1f3 43. Qxf3 Rxf3 44. Re6 Qxd5 45. Re8+ Rf8+ 46. Kh2 Rxe8 47. h4 Re2+ 48. Kg1 Best: +15.66 » 39. Kh2 Nxe2 40. Rxe2 Rf2+ 41. Rxf2 Rxf2+ 42. Kg3 Qxd4 43. Qf3 Rxf3+ 44. Kxf3 Qd5+ 45. Kf4 g5+ 46. Ke3 Qxb5 47. Ke4 Qe8+ 48. Kf5 Qd7+ 49. Kf6} Nxe2+ {Here the analysis gives mate in 12 which I will leave as an excercise for the reader} 40. Rxe2 Rf7f3 {My intent here was Qxh3 bringing my queen into the thick of it. The computer gives mate in 11.} 41. Re3 {The computer gives this as mate in 5 which is quite a jump from previously. Fortunately for me I did see this one and programmed in some conditional moves} Rf3f1+ 42. Kg2 {The white king starts his march up the board} Rf8f2+ 43. Kg3 Qd6+ 44. Kg4 Qf4+ 45. Kh5 g6# {I find it somehow satisfying to get mate with a pawn, even more so due to the difference in ratings.  Thanks for reading please comment on where and why I could have improved}
