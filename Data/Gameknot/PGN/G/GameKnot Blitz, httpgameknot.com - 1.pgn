[Opening "Alekhine's defence (B02), Scandinavian variation"]

1. e4 {Standard e4 opening} Nf6 {Black opts for Alekhine's defence, which I know nothing about.} 2. Nc3 {So I just defend the pawn.} e5 3. Nf3 {And go for the Spanish, which I'm more comfortable with} Nc6 4. Bb5 Bc5 5. O-O O-O 6. d3 Nd4 {Not worth capturing, as that would only expose the other knight to attack.} 7. Bg5 {Developing the bishop and pinning black Knight to queen. I only realised afterwards that I'd made a mistake by not moving the white bishop out of the line of attack. True, I can recapture with the knight, but I've come to regard the light square bishop as more valuable, especially in this kind of opening.} Nxb5 8. Nxb5 c6 9. Nc3 Re8 10. Ne2 {I think I was thinking if the d4 pawn push here.} d5 {An interesting move, as if he anticipated my thinking, and countered with his own pawn push. If I don't do anything, he will occupy the d4 square, controlling the centre.} 11. Bxf6 {First remove one of the defenders of the d5 pawn, then exd5.} Qxf6 12. exd5 cxd5 13. d4 {And complete the initial intention of occupying d4. Looking at this position now, both knights and queen on the white diagonal seems to invite a pin from the white bishop, which black never makes.} e4 {Does not seem a strong move. It only helps the knight to a better square.} 14. Ne5 Bd6 {Moving the bishop out of the way, and adds a third attacker on the knight.} 15. f4 {Another defender on the knight, and opening the file for the took, should he capture en passant, which is what I was expecting.} Qh4 {This seems to invite G3, but better is...} 16. h3 {Keeping the king protected, and preventing the pin on white queen.} Bxe5 {A little surprised. It did not seem a great loss.} 17. fxe5 {Opening the file} Be6 {Protecting from knf4 attack, but blocking the rook} 18. Qe1 {Probably one of the most significant moves of the game. I was looking for the exchange, as his queen looked dangerous. If he avoided it, the white queen takes possession of an important diagonal.} Qg5 19. Qg3 {Still looking for the exchange, giving some play to white knight.} Qd2 {I never saw this. I spent almost a minute trying to figure this out. I had to save the knight. Black will capture the pawn. I had thought of capturing white bishop, but something better came along.} 20. Nf4 Qxc2 {It was here that a strong move occurred to me.} 21. Rf2 {Attacking the queen and preparing to double the rooks . Suddenly, a lot of fire power is being directed towards black king. Maybe he should have gone for the exchange after all.} Qc8 22. Raf1 {It was here that I noticed the dangerous looking knh5} Qd7 {Black was trying to add a defender to f7, but also walked into a royal fork a little down the road, which he avoids by resigning after the next move.} 23. Nh5 {The game could have continued though, with kf8.}
