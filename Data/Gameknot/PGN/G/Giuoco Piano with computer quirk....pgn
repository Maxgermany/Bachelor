[Opening "Hungarian defence (C50)"]

1. e4 {I don't make any inaccuracies in this opening, but slowly my first-move advantage slips away and Black gets quite a lead. And then messes it up - or does he?} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Be7 {Unusually passive reply from my opponent! It does stop my Knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would!} 4. O-O Nf6 5. d3 {Perhaps 5.Nc3 was better? I didn't fancy the tactical complications should Black take the e-pawn and then play d5.} O-O 6. Nc3 d6 {We both develop normally, and I see the advantage of Black having the dark-squared Bishop on e7, behind the pawn chain. It doesn't get driven back and can join a K-side attack.} 7. h3 {Now I'm the one being over-cautious, preventing the pin on the Knight. But Black has more aggressive plans than a mere pin.} Na5 {Attempting to double my pawns and removing the Bishop that's aimed at the King is not a bad idea!} 8. Nd2 {I can't prevent the exchange, but I can ensure my pawns don't get doubled.} a6 9. a4 {Preventing 9...b5. But I've rather handed the initiative to Black.} Nxc4 10. Nxc4 Be6 {Another attempt to double pawns.} 11. Nd2 {So I retreat.} c6 {Allowing the Queen the option of heading to the Q-side and preparing for a possible d5.} 12. Nf3 {I get back to f3, having made four moves to prevent the doubling of my pawns, which doesn't see too good a deal, in retrospect. But now my dark-squared Bishop is free.} b5 {Back on the Q-side, Black is opening a file for his Rook.} 13. axb5 {I can't see a problem with allowing an open a-file, since my Rook is on it as well.} axb5 14. Bg5 {This seems the best square for the Bishop, even though it doesn't actually threaten anything. And I have to move it to give my Rook a defence.} Rxa1 15. Qxa1 {Black has conceded control of the a-file, but taken my Queen away from the main game.} Nh5 {Black is looking for exchanges, being happier in the endgame.} 16. Be3 {For the present I want to keep my Bishop on the board.} Qd7 {I can see Black is setting up an attack on my h-pawn, which I had no real need to advance. I don't fancy allowing him to open up my position, even for a point advantage...} 17. Kh2 {So I defend with ym King too.} f5 {Black has built up a strong K-side attack now.} 18. Ng5 {One of those Bishops has to go; having two lined up side by side is too dangerous.} Bxg5 19. Bxg5 f4 {Black cuts off my Bishop's retreat.} 20. Qd1 {This drives the Knight to f6...} Nf6 21. Bxf6 {Where I can exchange and avoid the Bishop being trapped.} Rxf6 22. Qf3 {Adding to the defence of the h-pawn.} Rh6 {Black builds up against it. I can't see I've done anything wrong, but I'm under a lot of pressure!} 23. Kg1 {My King retreats. Despite having made no inaccuracies, the computer has me a massive -1.55 behind at this point. And then, according to the analysis, Black blows it...} Bxh3 {Wiping out his advantage with the following, probably drawn, result: â€¦ Bxh3 24. gxh3 Rxh3 25. Qg2 Rh6 26. Qf3 Rg6+ 27. Kh2 Rh6+ 28. Kg2 Rg6+ 29. Kh2... and we repeat. But wait! } 24. gxh3 {When I actually play the obvious capture, I'm down -4.38! Good to know even a computer analysis can be wrong.} Rxh3 25. Qg2 f3 {And instead of retreating as per the computer's drawn repeat of moves, Black advances his f-pawn and I'm in real trouble.} 26. Qg5 {My only escape square!} Rh6 {Black gets ready to pin my Queen...} 27. Qf5 {I thought I'd escaped here, because I have a check on c8 if the Queen moves...} Rg6+ 28. Kh2 Qe7 {The check only works if the Queen helpfully goes here, instead of d8} 29. Qc8+ Kf7 30. Qf5+ Rf6 {There's no chance of a repeat of checks though, since the Rook can block.} 31. Qh5+ Kg8 32. Rg1 {In case I get lucky and Black plays 32...Rh6 right away....} Qe6 {Before guarding the square with the Queen as well.} 33. Kg3 {Panic, and I've lost my Rook and the game. 33.Ra1 with the threat of check on a8 might have given me a little more time.} Rg6+ 34. Kxf3 Rxg1 {But now I'm too far down in material...} 35. Qh4 {And preparing a fairly pointless back-rank check...} Qf6+ {Just forces a Queen exchange.} 36. Qxf6 gxf6 37. Ne2 Rb1 {I carry on for a few moves} 38. b3 Rb2 39. c4 bxc4 40. bxc4 {Even getting rid of a few pawns isn't going to help.} Rb3 41. Ke3 Kf7 42. Ng3 Rb6 43. Nf5 c5 44. f4 h5 45. fxe5 fxe5 46. Kf3 Kg6 47. Kg3 Rb3 48. Nh4+ Kf6 49. Kf2 Rxd3 50. Nf5 Ke6 51. Ng7+ {Black allows me one final pawn to seize.} Kd7 52. Nxh5 Rd4 {But as the others must fall, I resign. Curious that the move the computer has as Black's first error was actually the move that won the game! Beware the computer analysis!}
