1. e3 d5 2. Nc3 e5 {I like claiming the center.} 3. g3 Nf6 4. Bg2 d4 {I feel like I'm overextending but c5 will allow me to hang onto the d pawn even if I have to exchange the d pawn.} 5. exd4 exd4 6. Ne4 c5 7. d3 Nc6 8. Bg5 Be7 {This opening seems kind of even. Black has more space but is slightly overextended. } 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Qe2 {I did not get this move at first. Really, he was planning for an interesting game by castling queenside. It quickly became a race for the kill. I don't mind trading away my black squared bishop as he may be bad if my pawns stay on the board. Otherwise he may be useful for an attack on the queenside.} O-O 11. O-O-O Qa5 {Abandoning my bishop, I go for the queenside. Not much theory but just going with intuition.} 12. Kb1 Nb4 13. a3 Be6 {Banking on the threat of Qa2+, Qa1+, Qxb2.} 14. Nxf6+ gxf6 15. Qd2 Qa4 {I still am not quite sure how to attack, 16. ... Nxc2 17. Qxc2 Bb3 18. Qd2 Bxd1 leaves me up the exchange. If he does not take the knight Nxa3+ is an option.} 16. Bxb7 {?? This is not appropriate. It opens the b line. White should be focusing on attacking my kingside as opposite side castling is usually a race to kill the king. } Rab8 {Not just a reflex, this takes advantage of the b column and gains a tempo. Considering my g pawn is gone, my king is relatively safe.} 17. Be4 {I played with the idea of f5 as Bxh7+ is an interesting line. } Nd5 {I have a couple of options here Nxc2 is still an option. Qxa3 is an option with the discovered knight check, it just did not look promising. c4 is just a plain bad idea. I chose this move as if 18. Bxd5 Bxd5 19. f3 Qxa3 and my attack is looking good.} 18. Ka1 {breaking the pin. I thought my attack may be over at this point. However, I found a nice sacrifice.} Rxb2 {!! I win. The threat of Qxa3# is too strong to refuse the rook. c1 was a better square for his king, although I can still drive a good attack.} 19. Kxb2 {Game over.} Rb8+ 20. Ka2 Nc3+ {Ka1 is forced due to the double check. GG mate.}
