1. e4 {Usual King's Pawn Opening.} e5 {King's Pawn Game as usual.} 2. Nf3 {Once again, being offensive is in White's nature.} d6 {I don't usually do this, but moving my pawn to d6... here we go.} 3. Bc4 {Bc4 for some reason. } Be6 {I initiated a bishop trade early in the game.} 4. Bxe6 {He decides to take it.} fxe6 5. d3 d5 6. Qe2 {Qe2 for more protection, I assume. I'm not sure that's a good move on White's part.} Nc6 {Finally allowed my Nc6 into play.} 7. exd5 {He takes my pawn.} exd5 8. Nxe5 {Knight trade this time. Unfortunately, White will be up by 1 point.} Nxe5 {I decided to do it.} 9. Qxe5+ {White Queen takes my knight and checks me. I'm not too worried though.} Qe7 {Queen trade if White agrees.} 10. Qxe7+ {White does.} Bxe7 {Bishop and knight will be my main tools now. } 11. O-O {White castles.} O-O-O {So do I, but I did it on the Queen's side.} 12. Re1 {Re1 threatening Be7 to take control of the e-file. However, my Knight that hasn't moved yet will still protect my bishop. } g6 {Pawn time. I probably should have done a better move though.} 13. Nc3 {However, White gets to bring his knight into play.} c6 {Giving my King a bit of leeway just in case... but I'll soon regret that.} 14. Be3 {Be3 I didn't notice that my pawn at a7 was unprotected.} h6 {Horrible move on my part.} 15. Bxa7 {Now I realized that I needed to be more aware. It was my mistake which would cost me much more.} Bg5 {Sent my bishop to g5 to see if I could take the Rook at e1.} 16. Na4 {I didn't know where that White Knight was going...} Bf4 {Huge mistake #2 for me as Black. My mouse decided to click even though I wanted to move to d2 instead of f4.} 17. Nb6+ {Nb6 checks my King.} Kc7 {I move my king to the only possible position allowed.} 18. Re6 {Re6 to double team my King with the other Rook that hasn't moved yet.} g5 {I decided to protect my pawn by moving it to g5.} 19. Rae1 {That double Rook team there. It wasn't going to scare me.} Bd2 {I threaten it with Bd2.} 20. Re1e2 {He wasn't scared though.} Bc1 {I'll just take that pawn at b2.} 21. Rg6 {I didn't know why Rg6 but it turned out later that he wanted to check my King at g7.} Bxb2 {I took the pawn.} 22. Rg7+ {Rg7 check. I could easily take it with my bishop.} Kd6 {But I didn't notice until it was too late and I moved my king instead. Huge mistake #3 here....} 23. Rg6+ {He checks me again.} Kc7 {So I move back, hoping he didn't notice that my Bishop was still at b2.} 24. c4 {But he does and moves his pawn to c4. } dxc4 {Huge mistake #4 here... I took the pawn and didn't notice that Re2 was threatening to take my Bishop.} 25. Rxb2 {And he took it.} Rxd3 {So I took his pawn to try to make up for my blunders.} 26. Rg7+ {He checks me once more now that his Rook is safe.} Kd8 {I fall back to d8.} 27. Nxc4 {His Knight takes another pawn, not noticing the terrible position that his King was in..} Rd1# {I managed to checkmate White with only my Rook at d1 because White was too focused on taking my pieces and didn't give his King an escape route. Honestly, I should have lost this game, but White was too focused on trying to get my King and not protecting his King.}
