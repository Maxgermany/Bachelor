[Opening "Old Indian defence (A41)"]

1. d4 {My opponent starts with d4, so I expect a more positional response to my opening.} d6 {This is my way of entering Philidor's Defense without the annoying Bc4 variations.  I will play Nf6 in response to the move e4.} 2. c4 {Instead of e4, my opponent goes with a more positional option.  He reserves the opportunity to move the e pawn to e3 or e4.} c6 {Another part of my opening setup, allowing the queen to go to c7 and guarding the d5 square.} 3. Nc3 {Continuing his development and targeting both e4 and d5.} Nf6 {I respond with the same idea.  It is still possible for him to play e4 if he wants to.} 4. g3 {Instead he opts to fianchetto the bishop.  This doesn't seem to me like the best setup against a pawn on c6 and a queen on c7, but maybe he counted on pressure on the long diagonal. } Nbd7 {I continue to prepare for an e5 push.} 5. Bg2 {He completes the fianchetto, and looks ready to castle on the kingside.} e5 {The e5 break is finally here, and it is up to white whether to exchange the pawn or let it remain there.} 6. Nf3 {White adds pressure to e5 and is ready to castle.} Qc7 {I add defense to e5 and have the queen well placed to guard c6 as well.} 7. O-O {White castles and retains a slight lead in development.} a5 {I was concerned about a b4 push and a queenside attack on the c6 pawn.  This move is thematic in this opening, but it is not always good as it leaves a hole on b6 that can be reached by the c3 knight via a4.} 8. b3 {Preparing a queenside fianchetto and possibly preparing a queenside advance.} g6 {This move is a bit unusual for my system, as the bishop usually goes on e7.  But I felt that it would be stronger on g7 to counter his fianchetto.} 9. Bb2 {He completes his fianchetto.} Bg7 {And so do I.} 10. e3 {This secures the d4 pawn and frees up white's queen.} O-O {I take the opportunity to castle.  Development is about even except for my c8 bishop which is trapped at the moment.} 11. Re1 {I'm not sure that this is a great place for the rook, because I won't exchange on d4 but he might exchange on e5.  d1 and c1 would be good places for the white rooks.} Re8 {I counter on the e file, and my rook is much better placed than his.} 12. Qc2 {Allowing the queen to control several important squares.  The g6 pawn does dampen the queen's influence somewhat.} Nf8 {Planning to relocate to e6.  This also allows the c8 bishop out.} 13. d5 {Keeps the knight off e6 and starting to lock the center.} Bf5 {My bishop finally comes into play.  Now development is finally equal.} 14. e4 {Locks the center even more.  This probably isn't a great idea because it keeps both of white's bishops out of the game, while my c8 bishop will remain active.} Bg4 {Continuing to apply pressure on the kingside.} 15. h3 {This kicks the bishop but creates a weakness on the kingside.  Now the bishop and queen can line up to target the pawn.} Bd7 {Retreats the bishop and waiting to attack the h3 pawn.} 16. a4 {This is not a good move because it takes the a4 square away from the knight.  It also creates a weak pawn on b3, which will be an important factor later.} Nh5 {Attempting to provoke g4 after which the knight will go to f4.} 17. Kh2 {Solidifying the kingside.} f5 {Trying to break up the kingside with f4.} 18. Nh4 {Attacking the f5 pawn. } f4 {Moving further into the kingside and clearing the path of the bishop to attack h3.} 19. g4 {Locking the kingside pawns and forcing the knight back.} Nf6 {Retreating and attacking g4.} 20. Bf3 {Blocking the f pawn and protecting g4.} Qd8 {Threatening to play Nxg4+ and win a pawn because the h4 knight is hanging.} 21. Ng2 {Preventing the Nxg4 tactic.} h5 {Continuing to break up the kingside.} 22. dxc6 {Opening the d file.} bxc6 {Recapturing.} 23. gxh5 {Exchanging.} gxh5 {I take back.} 24. Qd3 {White is trying to win the d6 pawn and black can't really guard it.  I decide to try to set a trap instead.} Qc7 {Defending the pawn one time.} 25. Rad1 {Adding another attacker.} Ne6 {Here my plan is to play Nd4 and trap a piece after black takes the pawn.} 26. Qxd6 {Wins a pawn.} Qxd6 {I exchange in order to trap the rook.} 27. Rxd6 {He recaptures.} Nd4 {Now the rook is trapped.  The bishop is under attack and I can play Kf7 and Bf8 and win the rook.} 28. Bxh5 {This is tactic that doesn't work.  After the game, my opponent told me that he missed the fork on f3.} Nxh5 {I take the bishop and now my bishop is unguarded.} 29. Rxd7 {Takes my bishop and is up two pawns.  There is just one problem.} Nf3+ {This is what my opponent missed.} 30. Kh1 {Forced.} Nxe1 {And I win the exchange.  I have a rook for a knight and two pawns, but my pieces can coordinate better.} 31. Nxe1 {He recaptures and the endgame begins.} Red8 {Trying to win the e file.} 32. Rxd8+ {Rc7 would be much better by keeping up the pressure.  This allows me to completely dominate the e file.} Rxd8 {Recapturing.} 33. Nf3 {Bringing the knight back into play and attacking the e5 pawn.} Rb8 {Attacking the weak b3 pawn.  This is the consequence of white playing a4 all the way back on move 16.} 34. Nd2 {Defending b3.} Nf6 {Planning to go to d7 and then d5 to pile up on the b3 pawn.} 35. Kg2 {Moving the king towards the center.} Nd7 {Heading for c5.} 36. Ba3 {Cutting off the c5 square.} Bf8 {Forcing the bishop to give way.} 37. Bxf8 {I would have kept the bishops on to maintain some counter play, but white is in big trouble either way.} Kxf8 {Recapturing.} 38. Na2 {This knight is heading to c1 to defend b3 again.} Kf7 {Moving the king towards the center.} 39. Nc1 {Defending b3 again.} Nc5 {Double attack on b3, forcing both knights to stay where they are.} 40. h4 {Trying to create counter play with the passed pawn.} Kf6 {Moving towards the center and the pawn.} 41. Kh3 {Bringing the king to help the pawn.} Rg8 {Cutting the king off from g4.} 42. Kh2 {White is close to zugswang, so he sticks to moving the king. } Rg7 {I was low on time, so I tried to think of a winning plan on his time.} 43. f3 {A bad move that opens the second rank up completely.  That is not a good idea when trying to defend against a rook.} Rg8 {Again looking for a plan.} 44. Ne2 {Trying to free up the knights.  Here I saw what I needed to do and forced the knight back to c1.} Rb8 {Attacking b3 again.} 45. Nc1 {Forced to defend.} Rd8 {Attacking the knight and it has no where to go.  Nf1 loses to the fork Rd1.} 46. b4 {Another mistake.  My opponent missed that the capture was with check.  The check would have been avoided if the pawn hadn't been moved from f2 to f3.} Rxd2+ {Here white resigned.  This game is a pretty good example of how to play with a rook versus a knight and pawns.  I got an open file for my rook and tied his knights down to defending pawns.  With white reduced to passivity, it was relatively easily for me to break down his defensive wall.}
