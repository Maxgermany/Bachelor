1. c4 {Once more, English Opening.  Always use this OTB and for now, will be using it on Gameknot as well.} Nf6 {Black keeps his options open, probably looking for d4 which transposes into a Queen's Indian.} 2. Nc3 {But I prefer to stay within the English lines, doubling my attack on the d5 square.} e5 {Probably considered the main line response.} 3. Nf3 {Natural development move, forcing Black to defend the e5 Pawn.} Nc6 {The natural defence of the e5 Pawn, developing a piece.  This takes us into the Four Knights Variation of the English.} 4. d4 {Attempting to provoke an exchange of Knights.} exd4 5. Nxd4 Bb4 {Which Black rejects, instead pinning my c3 Knight.} 6. Bg5 {Asks Black if he is really ready to exchange?} Bxc3+ {Which Black decides he is.  I think I'd have castled here instead, as a waiting move to see what White had in mind.} 7. bxc3 {However, in the short term things are looking up for Black, material is even but White now has doubled Pawns on the c-file.} O-O 8. e3 h6 {Black decides to drive away the White Bishop.  White has two options, either take the Knight as an exchange or retreat.  Bxf6 would've allowed Black's Queen to come out and play, which I wasn't ready for yet, so instead I decided to disrupt the Black King-Side Pawn formation by drawing out his Pawns in chase of my Bishop.  This was a tactic that paid off later in the game, allowing me to squeeze an advantage out of the game.} 9. Bf4 g5 {I realise this presented a huge target for Black and had its intended effect of drawing out Black's King-Side Pawn defence.  Instead, I think Black should've considered d6, opening up the light-side Bishop and protecting the weak c7 Pawn.} 10. Bg3 d6 {Black's defensive Pawn structure is weak, something that can be picked at as the game progresses.} 11. Qc2 {Enables the Queen-side castle, which by now I had decided was my best option, and helps put some pressure on the Black King which diverts his attention from my intended Queen-side attack.} Ne5 12. c5 b6 13. cxd6 cxd6 {Material is even, but White is already beginning to establish a lead positionally.} 14. h4 {I had two options here, h4 or O-O-O.  Normally I would've castled first, then pushed the Pawn.  But during my match with easy19 he had suggested I should always look at how a position can be achieved, then reverse the move order and see if anything jogs loose.  I decided I preferred the look of h4, but in hindsight think that perhaps I took the lesson too literally and should've stuck to my gut instinct of O-O-O.} g4 15. O-O-O Qe7 {As I wanted, all of Black's pieces are now positioned to repel an attack on the King-side.  So in order to gain some more value from the game I begin my attack on the Queen-side.} 16. Bf4 {Threatens Black's h4 Pawn, disrupting his defence further.} h5 17. Bg5 {Pins Black's Knight at f6.} d5 18. f4 {Placing a threat on Black's Knight.} Ned7 {Moves to relative safety and opens up the e-file for Black's Queen to begin an attack on the undefended e3 Pawn.} 19. Bb5 Qxe3+ {Black wins a Pawn, checking my King.} 20. Kb2 Qe4 {Black offers an exchange of Queens.  I was happy to oblige, but didn't want Black to be able to move his d-Pawn onto the e-file, so rather than take the offered Queen I. . .} 21. Rhe1 {Forced Black into making the exchange in a more positionally favourable position for me.} Qxc2+ 22. Kxc2 Ne4 23. Bc6 {Forks Black's d5 Pawn and his Rook.} Rb8 24. Be7 {A threat on the other Black Rook, now both my Bishops are well positioned to cause mayhem :o)} Re8 {Black desperately tries to send my Bishop away.} 25. Nf5 {A weak pins on Black's d5 pawn and removes the threat on my Bishop, allowing him to stay where he is for now.} Kh7 26. Rxd5 {Equalises the material and threatens Black's Knight.} Ndf6 {Defends Black's Knight at e4 and threatens White's Rook.} 27. Re5 Bxf5 {I love this little exchange here for White :o)} 28. Bxe8 Rxe8 29. Rxf5 Rxe7 30. Rxf6 Kg7 {At the end of which, White has won a Rook, a Bishop and a Knight for both his hard working Bishops and Knight.} 31. Rc6 {Shifting my Rook away from danger and placing the focus on Black's Queenside again.} f5 32. a4 g3 {Stops White from being able to defend either the f or h Pawns.  I prefer Kg8 instead.} 33. c4 Kf7 34. Re3 Nc5 {Forks my Rook and a4 Pawn and blocks the advance of my c4 Pawn.} 35. Rxe7+ {I accept the exchange.} Kxe7 36. Rg6 {Looking at getting rid of the a7 Pawn.} Ne4 {Black misjudged my aim, defending the wrong Pawn.  I prefer Ne6, which would've stopped me from being able to play my next move, which was the decisive one leading the victory.} 37. Rg7+ {Although the game is not over, at this point I was sure I was capable of winning the match.  Black is forced to abandon his a7 Pawn, which will allow me to Queen one of my Pawns on that side.} Kf6 {I think a better move would've been Kd6, to attempt to stop the advance of my Pawn's towards his back rank.} 38. Rxa7 Nc5 39. Kc3 Ne6 40. Ra6 Nxf4 41. Rxb6+ {The way is clear for a run by my a or c Pawn.  I decided on sending the a-Pawn because the Rook protects his advance.} Ke5 42. Rb5+ Kd6 43. a5 Nxg2 {And Black moves himself into forced mate - 44.a6 Nf4 45.a7 Ne2+ 46.Kb2 Nd4 47.Rd5+ Ke7 48.Rxd4 g2 49.a8=Q g1=Q 50.Qb7+ Kf6 51.Qc6+ Kg7 52.Rd7+ Kh8 53.Qf6+ Qg7 54.Qxg7#.  I didn't spot this until analysis, but was confident that I would be able to Queen with 1 move to spare.} 44. a6 Ne3 45. a7 g2 46. a8=Q g1=Q {Nd1+ would've extended the game slightly, but it's all over now. 47.Qa6+ Kd7 48.Rb7+ Ke8 49.Qa8# compared to 47.Kd2 g1=Q 48.Qd5+ Ke7 49.Rb7+ Ke8 50.Qd7+ Kf8 51.Qf7#.} 47. Qa6+ {And Black admits defeat.  A wonderful game that I enjoyed greatly.}
