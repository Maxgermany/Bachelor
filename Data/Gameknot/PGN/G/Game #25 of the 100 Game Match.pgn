1. d4 {oldgus (warren) and I began playing each other months ago during a Queen's Gambit tourney.  We struck up a friendship and began playing each other regularly.  Eventually, we decided to play a 100 game match.  At the time of this annotation, my record against oldgus is 6 wins, 18 losses, and two draws (although our record against each other is roughly equal over the last 10 games).  This annotation was done without assistance from computer although the gameknot computer analysis is available.} Nf6 {I haven't played the King's Indian too much and wanted to learn.} 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {All standard book moves to this point.} 5. Be3 O-O 6. f3 {From my reading, White has employed the Samisch Variation.  White's center is relatively stable and he is in position to begin King-side attack.  A typical plan for White might include Qd2, Bh6, g2-g4, and h2-h4.  However, 6.f3 does inhibit his N on g1.} c5 {6...c5, from my reading, has become a popular method of attacking White's center.  This leads to the sacrifice of a pawn by Black.} 7. dxc5 dxc5 8. Bxc5 Nc6 {At this point, Black has a nice diagonal for his DSB, a lead in development, and a hole on d4.  However, White also is eying the d5 square with his N.} 9. Qxd8 Rxd8 10. Ba3 {Black is likely to move Nd7 and 10. Ba3 anticipates this move.} a5 {Queen side operations for Black?  Nb4 is now on the table.} 11. Rd1 Be6 {Development.  And besides, an exchange of R's would help White's King to escape over to the Q-side.} 12. Nd5 {And White's N moves to d5.  Taking the N would lead to recapture with the c-pawn and a nasty line of White pawns.} Nb4 {12...Nb4, eying Nc2+ and the end of White's DSB.} 13. Nxe7+ {Black goes down 2 pawns} Kh8 14. Rxd8+ Rxd8 15. Bxb4 axb4 {Black is down 2 pawns and his Q-side pawn structure is not happy.  And Ne7 is not pleasing.  Black does have the B-pair and a lead in development.} 16. Nd5 Ra8 {Looking at a2 while the DSB is looking at b2.} 17. Nxb4 {hmmm, Black is down 3 pawns.} Nd7 18. Ne2 {White allows the DSB to take on b2.  If White tried to protect b2, say with 18. b3, then 18...Bc3+ loses Nb4.} Bxb2 19. Nd5 Nc5 {18...Nc5?  Here, I believe, Black errs.  Black was thinking that he could simply grab a2 later and wanted to develop more pieces into the attack.  The R on a2 would have been nice and caused White much concern.  } 20. Nec3 {Bluntly, Black just missed this move.  a2 is well guarded and White's N's are connected.  It's not clear where Black can break through.  Black demonstrates his lack of calculation finesse.} Na4 {Obviously seeking to attack Nc3.} 21. Nd1 Bd4 {Black didn't want to trade N for B.  And the DSB is nicely centralized.} 22. Nc7 {This was anticipated and it made me sad.  I wanted to keep my B-pair.} Rc8 23. Nxe6 fxe6 {Black still has more active pieces White's extra pawns are problematic.} 24. Kd2 Nb6 25. Ne3 Na4 {Black seems to be floundering without a plan at this point.  } 26. Bd3 {And White's pieces are joining the game while Black's K is sleeping in the corner.} Bc3+ 27. Ke2 Ra8 {Still trying to grab a2} 28. f4 Nb2 29. Nd5 {And here, White makes a speculative sacrifice.  oldgus told me he could not resist.  He clearly believed that Black would not be able to stop the avalanche of White pawns.  } exd5 {Black feels obliged to accept the sacrifice.  Was there anything better for Black?  I certainly couldn't find it.} 30. cxd5 Bd4 {Centralizing the DSB.} 31. Bb1 {Protecting a2...Oh how I wish I had taken a2 on move 18.} Rc8 32. g3 Kg8 {The K wakes up and decides his services could be helpful.} 33. Re1 Kf7 34. e5 {The ants go marching 1 by 1 hurrah! hurrah!} Rc5 {34...Rc5  The hope was 35.	d6  Bxe5   36.fxe5  Rxe5+  37. Kf2 and Black would have also been able to scoop up d6.} 35. Be4 {But White sees Black's plan.} Na4 {Potentially forking White's K and B} 36. Kd3 Bc3 37. e6+ Ke7 38. Rc1 {Well, the B is pinned for the moment as Black is certainly not interested in exchanging pieces at the moment.} Nb2+ 39. Ke2 {39. Ke3? would have been quite good for Black.} Na4 40. g4 {The march continues.} Rc4 41. Kf3 b5 {Counterattack?} 42. f5 gxf5 43. Bxf5 {I actually expected 43. gxf5 as that would have advanced a pawn.  Plus, it looks scary to have three connected passed pawns.} h6 {Pretty well forced.} 44. Rb1 Nb2 {44...Nb2 blocks White's Rook and provides the possibility of attacking a2.} 45. a3 Ra4 46. h4 {I'm really starting to hate those pawns.} Rxa3 {Finally, 28 moves later, Black gets his pawn.} 47. g5 hxg5 48. hxg5 Be5+ {Centralizing the Bishop with a bit of tempo.} 49. Kg4 Rg3+ {White only has two choices.} 50. Kh5 Bf4 {Black thought he had g5.} 51. Bg4 {stupid Bishop.} Rd3 {Maybe Black can grab d5.} 52. Rf1 {stupid Rook.} Rd4 53. Bf3 Nc4 {The N was doing no good over on b2.  It may be possible to push b5 with counterattack chances.} 54. Rd1 {And White decides to exchange Rs.  Black has no choice in the matter.} Rxd1 55. Bxd1 Ne3 56. Bb3 {And at this point, a draw was decided upon.  Neither side could see how to break through--any ideas are welcome.  Please, feel free to criticize mercilessly as all comments are welcome.  My sincere thanks to oldgus as he has spent a good deal of time helping me improve my play.  My slow climb up the 1700s has been very much due to his efforts.}
