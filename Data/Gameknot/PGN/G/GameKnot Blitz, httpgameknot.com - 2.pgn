[Opening "King's Indian (A48), East Indian defence"]

1. d4 {A blitz game. My opponent had a higher rating, around 1700. I did not expect to win.} Nf6 {Going for the Nimzo-Indian defence} 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 d5 {I had no clear ideas here. I just thought of going for something sharp.} 4. c5 Bg7 {Carrying on with normal development} 5. Nc3 c6 6. b4 a6 7. a4 {White is clearly going for a pawn attack on the queen side. At this stage, I decided to leave off trying to counter this, and switch attention to normal development on the king side.} O-O 8. Bf4 {Good occupation of the diagonal.} Nbd7 9. b5 axb5 10. axb5 Rxa1 11. Qxa1 {The queen now has control of the a file, and is contesting the long diagonal. He is on the way to having a spatial advantage on the queen side, but to compensate, black has developed a solid defense on the king side.} Re8 {Creating space for the knight.} 12. b6 Nf8 13. Bc7 {Only one place to retreat.} Qd7 14. Ne5 {It now looks like white is developing a threatening attack, but the black defensive structure is solid.} Qe6 {Primarily defending f7, but also looking at white king} 15. e3 {Completing the pawn chain and opening the file for white bishop} Ne4 {At this stage, the knight is the only piece I wanted to move, keeping the king side structure solid and stable.} 16. Be2 {Preparing to attack the queen} Qf5 {Looking at Qf2#} 17. O-O Nd7 {A blunder, I think. The knight was alright where it was, but hard to see what would have been a better move.} 18. Bg4 {Strong check to the queen, winning the knight. I considered resigning.} Qf6 {Just moving out the way, but moving to a useful square.} 19. Bxd7 Bxd7 20. Nxd7 Qf5 {Moving to safety, and checking the knight.} 21. Ne5 Nd2 {The move I should have played earlier, I think. Again, the king side structure is solid. It appeared that there was no piece there which could be moved without creating a weakness. Only the knight was free to move. Here it would move the castle, then move back, threatening check. Just messing around, really.} 22. Re1 Ne4 23. Nf3 {Defending f2, but creating space for the e5 push} e5 {Bringing the castle into the game} 24. Nxe5 {Queen will win back the pawn with tempo} Qxf2+ 25. Kh1 {I was running out of time. I think I had a little over a minute, whereas white had around five. Nothing to do but to move back.} Qf5 {Rf1 maybe? But instead...} 26. Nf3 {Hard to see the point here.} Nf2+ {Again, just messing around. Again, it seems that this knight is the only piece which can move. All the others are keeping the defensive balance.} 27. Kg1 Ng4 {Attacking e3, the base of the pawn structure. Black has kept tempo, dictating the pace of the game, and preventing Qa7.} 28. Re2 {Planning to double up with the Queen? But the pawn is still underdefended.} Rxe3 29. Rxe3 Nxe3 {Although behind in points, black has compensated with tempo.} 30. Qa8+ {Easily defended, losing the pawn though.} Bf8 31. Qxb7 Qc2 {All of a sudden, things are looking dangerous for white. There is no way to save the knight, but more dangerous is the threatened mate on g2, which white appears to have overlooked.} 32. Nxd5 Qxg2# {}
