1. e4 {Hello i'd like to annotate this game because i found it fascinating...It was a game for the 5th round of 61st GK Tournament. I play with black here.  So he started with e4.} e5 {I played e5. I always prefer that move instead of playing c5.} 2. Nf3 {Typical.} Nc6 {And typical reply too. I don't like Nf6.} 3. Bb5 {He played with his white bishop. Nice move.} Nf6 {I replied by opening the knight and pushing e4 pawn. I like to open the king's side pieces.} 4. Nc3 {In order to protect the e4 pawn.} Bc5 {I open the bishop. I wanted to castle and also open my white bishop with d6 pawn.} 5. O-O O-O {We castled, so far a quiet game. Noone is risking.} 6. Nxe5 {So he attacked in the e pawn and i accepted that, nice move. He wanted to open the game and not being pathetic. i have the tendency as black to play a quiet game ( i prefer to play with white pawns).} Nxe5 {So i took it.} 7. d4 {I imagined that. Otherwise it would have been a bad move for him.} Bxd4 {I decided to sacrifice the bishop! Bye bye Bishop! I think i made the right choice.} 8. Qxd4 {He took my bishop and he's queen has somehow a more attacking attitude.} Qe7 {I decided to open my queen too and protect my knight.} 9. Bg5 {Now he's pushing the other knight but still i have no worries. Nice movement anyway.} c6 {I said now it's time to push his white bishop cause i did not like the square he controlled. But i had doubts for that movement..Nevermind!} 10. Bd3 {He put it back. I still didn't have a serious plan in my mind.} Nxd3 {So i decided to take his bishop and sacrifice my knight.} 11. cxd3 {Still it's ok!} d6 {d6 for opening the way for my white bishop. Another one would be fine i think..h6..But i did not make it so far.} 12. Qb4 {I didn't actually understand this move cause i believe Bxf6 would be better. But ok he might have another plan in his mind.} Qe5 {I put my queen in a better square i think.} 13. f4 {Nice! Now he shows me he likes to attack. But for me in a risky way. Who knows?} Qe7 {So i out my queen back!} 14. e5 {e5?! Strange move for me. But nice! Haha.} c5 {Well i played c5 for pushing his queen cause i didn't want to respond in his e5 movement.} 15. exf6 {Mmmmmmm strange again. At first i said oups whats that? What am i to do? But with a second thought i said ''great''! This is brilliant! He was attacking in an anorthodox way! See that..Qe3+!!} Qe3+ {Awesome!! My black queen must be so happy!} 16. Kh1 {Nowhere else to go!} cxb4 {Sorry mate but that was great!} 17. fxg7 {Ok that's good.} Kxg7 {No worries at all!} 18. Nd5 Qxd3 {I took the pawn and control the game...No i have to move fast and checkmate.} 19. Rad1 Qc4 {He's pushing my queen.} 20. b3 Qc2 {Still no worries!} 21. Nxb4 Qf5 22. Rxd6 {Took my pawn!} f6 {And push his bishop!} 23. Bh4 Be6 {Time for my bishop to move..} 24. Nd3 Rac8 {Open the rook.} 25. Bf2 Bd5 {Worthless.} 26. Bxa7 {Bad move.} Qxd3 {Of course i took it.. He had no chances of winning.} 27. Rxd5 {Bad move again.} Qxf1+ {That's nice.} 28. Bg1 {The only think he can do.} Rc1 {Im' going for checkmate.} 29. Rd7+ {Worthless.} Kg8 30. Rg7+ {Again bad move.} Kxg7 {Bye bye rook!} 31. g4 {Nothing else to do.} Qxg1# {And checkmate. I think that was nice. COmment and rate the game if you like! Thanks very much, Mario Dag!}
