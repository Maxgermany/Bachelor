1. e4 {A very tough game!!!     This was a GK tournament, all I needed was a draw and my opponent had more games to play but loosing to me meant he was out. A draw would have given him hope provided he won the rest of his games.} c5 {I remember when I would almost always loose to this move.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 e6 4. Bb5 {I learned later to just play my game and would be able to handle black.} Nge7 5. d3 g6 {When one plays the Sicilian I usually castle on the opposite side and push my pawns till the defense crumbles. It usually works quite well.} 6. Be3 {This was the start to my castling queen's side.} Bg7 {Mistake by black.} 7. Bxc5 O-O 8. Bxc6 {Just try to see if black is attentive. Would he capture using the knight?} dxc6 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Qd2 b5 11. O-O-O {Usually I wouldn't castle this side with my opponent better developed but I thought he was not that strong a player.} a5 {I was being played in my own game, but I know not to panic.} 12. h4 {Trying the pawn push.} e5 {Good move by black. The g pawn won't get into the attack that easily and a single pawn is not that destructive.} 13. h5 Bg4 14. h6 Bf6 {Black starts to play quite well. There is a deadly move for black Bg5.} 15. Kb1 Bxf3 16. gxf3 Bg5 17. Qe1 a4 {Black is pawn down but developing much better. I decide to use my pieces more effectively.} 18. Qg1 Bf4 19. Ne2 Bg5 {Black starts to waste moves.} 20. Qg3 f5 {This seems to be a mistake by black. } 21. Rdg1 {This attack means that the bishop cannot move to f6 because the f-pawn would be lost.} Bd2 22. c3 {An attempt at getting a bishop exchange with pawn.} f4 23. Qg4 b4 24. c4 {If left unchecked the bishop will be capture free.} b3 25. a3 Qd6 26. Rh2 {At this point I was caught in a corner and could only make subtle moves. There was no way to defend the pawn.} Qxd3+ 27. Ka1 {It would seem black just had to capture the knight. However the next moves would likely follow: 27. Ka1 Qxe2 28. Qe6+ Rf7 29. Rhg2 Qd3 30. Rxg6+ Kh8 31. Qxf7 In other words with the queen out of the defense black would be at white's messy.  29. Rhg2 being the killer move.    } Qd6 {A wise move.} 28. Rhg2 Rf6 29. Rd1 Rd8 30. Nc3 Qf8 31. Nb1 Ba5 32. Rxd8 Qxd8 33. Qg5 Qd6 34. Rg1 Bb6 35. Rd1 Qxd1 {Positional exchange.} 36. Qxf6 Qd7 37. Qxe5 Bxf2 38. Qxf4 Bd4 39. e5 c5 {At this point I notice that black is in his ideal position. He has mighty few moves.} 40. Qf6 {Tightening the grip} Qc7 41. Qe6+ {I wonder if f4 would have been a better move. It just lacks strength I guess.} Kf8 42. Qf6+ {This was my first opportunity to get a draw.} Qf7 43. Qxf7+ {But I thought my position was stronger being pawn up.} Kxf7 44. f4 Ke6 45. Nc3 {From this point on analysis of moves was taking a long time. Conditional moves were difficult to make because of the many options. As it stood this looked more like a draw. I offered my opponent a draw...} g5 {He turned it down with an excellent move. It seemed like the killer move, and I wasn't supposed to lose.} 46. fxg5 Bxe5 47. Ne4 Kf5 {Rushed move. Bf5 would have been more powerful. Though not necessarily the winning move.} 48. Nxc5 Kxg5 49. Nxa4 Bd4 50. Kb1 {This is where black got the opportunity to win it. I made my move at night and couldn't even sleep because it looked like black had won it. All he needed to do was block my king at this very point with Be3. My king had to get to the h flange in about the same number of moves black needed to queen his pawn. By blocking my king preventing black would have been nearly impossible.} Kxh6 {I was so glad he didn't see the move.} 51. Kc1 Kg5 52. Nc3 h5 53. c5 {At this point I knew the game was won. A combination of luck and some analysis helped win it. I didn't need to defend the pawn yet unless black captured my C-pawn first.} Bxc3 54. bxc3 h4 55. c6 h3 56. c7 h2 57. c8=Q h1=Q+ 58. Kb2 Qd1 59. Qg8+ Kf6 60. Qxb3 Qe2+ 61. Qc2 Qb5+ 62. Kc1 Qf1+ 63. Qd1 Qf4+ 64. Kc2 Qe4+ 65. Kc1 Qf4+ {I was almost stuck here until I realized that a1 was well protected. The first idea was to force a defense that would lead to a check but it didn't look like it was coming.} 66. Kb2 Qf2+ 67. Ka1 Qa7 {The next 14 moves were set as conditional. One would normally resign but there were always opportunities in this game for both players.} 68. Qd4+ Qxd4 69. cxd4 Ke6 70. Kb2 Kd5 71. Kb3 Kxd4 72. Kb4 Kd5 73. Kb5 Kd6 74. Kb6 Kd7 75. Kb7 Kd6 76. a4 Kc5 77. a5 Kb5 78. a6 Kc5 79. a7 Kd5 80. a8=Q Kd4 81. Qe8 Kd5 82. Qe3 Kd6 83. Qe4 Kc5 84. Kc7 Kb5 85. Qd4 Ka5 86. Kc6 Ka6 87. Qb6# {The only one out of the group. Good play from my opponent.}
