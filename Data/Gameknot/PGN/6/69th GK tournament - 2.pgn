Qe4 Bf5 {At the time I was not sure how good of a move this was.  Basically, I was just messing with the queen. } 14. Qf4 {good move, will make me think twice before moving the bishop.} Rfd8 {Not really sure what I was doing here, other than I like to exchange pieces.} 15. Qxc7 {He got greedy!.  Did not think about the path he was openly up to the qreen. } Rdc8 16. Qxb7 {He got even more greedy!  Now I have a path to the queen and a way to put the queen in danger at the same time. } Na5 {At this point I know I was going to win.  I just opened up so many attacks.} 17. Qb5 {There was nowhere to go that would save the queen.  He may as well taken a pawn at a7 or f7.} Rxc2+ {Check! and it only gets worse for the next move} 18. Kb1 {White does only move} Rc5+ {check again!} 19. Qd3 {Not really sure how good/bad of a move this is} Rb8 {Go for the checkmate at b2} 20. Rd2 {white backs up the pawn} Nc4 {I add the knight to the fight} 21. b3 {All moves were bad at this point, but b3 may have been the worst} Na3# {}
