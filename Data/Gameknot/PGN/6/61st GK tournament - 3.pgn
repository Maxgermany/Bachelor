1. e4 {The most logical move. } c6 {this follows the Caro-Kann defence.Although it seems strange,but it projects d5 without the need for the queen or knight to recapture.} 2. d4 {The most logical answer to Black's second move.} d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 {3....dxe4 is the best move as black seems to have nothing more constructive than it.} 4. Nxe4 g6 5. Nf3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7. Nxf6+ Bxf6 8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O {untill now,this follows GAMEKNOT database.} Re8 10. Re1 Nd7 11. Bf4 {to prevent 11....e5.} Nb6 12. Bb3 Nd5 13. Bg3 b6 14. Rc1 Bb7 15. c3 e6 16. a3 Qe7 17. Qc2 c5 18. c4 {c4!!} Nc7 19. d5 {it is clear that 19....exd5 loses to 20.Rxe7.} Qd7 20. d6 Na6 21. Ba4 Bc6 22. Bxc6 Qxc6 23. Rcd1 Red8 24. Rd2 Nb8 25. Be5 {Be5!!! if 25....Bh8 26.Bxh8 then 27.Qc3+ followed by 28.Qf6!! and if 25....Bxe5 then 26.Ne5 threatening white queen and white has much better game. and if 25....Kg7   26.Bxf6+ 26....Kxf6   27.Qc3+ 27....Kf5    28.Qe5#   } Bg7 26. Bxg7 Kxg7 27. Qc3+ Kg8 {27....f6 would be a mistake because of 28.Rxe6!} 28. Ne5 {threatening the black queen.} Qb7 29. Ng4 {29.Ng4!!!! white threatens 30.Nh6+ then 31.Qh8#.} h5 {black finds the best and only defence that doesn't lead to mate or queen or rock sacrifices.} 30. Nf6+ Kf8 {again black finds best defense as 30....Kg7 will lead to a discovered check and 30....Kh8 31.Nxh5 and black is forced to play f6 to avoid mate next move.} 31. Nxh5 {31.Nxh5!!!! white threatening Qh8#  if 31....gxh5 32.Qh8# if 31....f5 then 32.Qh8+ 32....Kf7   33.Qg7+ 33....Ke8   34.Nf6#   } Ke8 {for the third time,black found the best move.} 32. Nf6+ Kf8 33. Nh5 Ke8 34. Qg7 {34.Qg7!!!! here black resigned because white threatening 35.Rxe6+ if 35....fxe6 36.Nf6# and if 35....Kd7 36.Re7+ and queen dies.  Black,with the best defense,will lose at least another two pawns to avoid mate or queen or rock sacrifices and he is already a pawn down.}
