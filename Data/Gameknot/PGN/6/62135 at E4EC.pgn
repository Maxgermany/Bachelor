1. e4 c5 {I opened with the Sicilian Defense. As I use to against 1.e4.} 2. Bc4 e6 {By the way, this game was played through e-mail, at the fully automated e-mail chess site E4EC. I started playing a little a year ago by e-mail because I wanted training for my ICCF correspondence chess tournaments! Have continued to do so, of course it´s easier to play on a server, but it´s kinda fun with e-mail too.} 3. Nc3 Nc6 {One thing you must been alert on, is that nearly every single e-mail chess site has it´s own specific rules, for example time controls and allowing/ not allowing external help as game databases, computer analysis can be much different from site to site. This site, E4EC, are not allowing any help at all, not even Opening Explorer!} 4. Nf3 a6 5. d3 g6 {I planning fianchetto at g7.} 6. a3 Bg7 7. Bd2 Nge7 8. Na4 {???? Bad move! Allows a pawn fork against White´s Bishop at c4 and Knight at a4.} b5 9. Nxc5 bxc4 10. dxc4 Bxb2 {Now I get a free pawn too! And an open b-file!} 11. Ra2 Bg7 {Back is safest!} 12. Ng5 O-O {Castling. Probably it would be the best move also for White to castle in the next move?} 13. Qf3 {Aiming at pawn f7.} Qb6 {Threatening the Knight at c5, but also will also win Rook a2 in the next move, if White plays wrong here.} 14. Nb3 {The best defense move.} Nd4 {Kinda tricky. If White takes my Knight with his Knight at b3, I will win White´s Rook a2 with check! Also threatening White´s Queen! } 15. Qh3 {Counter-threat! White is threatening mate in one at h7 in next move! A defense move is a must!} h6 {h6. Pretty simple.} 16. Nf3 {??? Bad move. Are blocking White Queen from protecting the b3-square, which will lead to tactics and White Rook-loss. } Nxb3 17. cxb3 Qxb3 {Now Rook a2 is lost!} 18. O-O {Castling, but White has already lost to much material!} Qxa2 {It´s not getting better for White now.} 19. Bxh6 f6 20. e5 {A counter-attack against Black´s King begins to develop.} Qxc4 21. exf6 Rxf6 22. Ng5 {And there comes the Knight!} Bb7 23. Bxg7 Kxg7 24. Qh7+ {Kinda worrying attack against my King!} Kf8 25. Qh8+ Ng8 {The only move.} 26. Nh7+ {A fork.} Ke7 27. Qg7+ Rf7 {Saves the day for Black´s Rook.} 28. Qxg6 Qe4 {Trying to force exchange. Because of Black´s huge material advantage it´s a good idea!} 29. Qg5+ {Trying to continue the attack.} Nf6 {But now has Black good defenders of his King.} 30. Nxf6 Rxf6 31. Qg7+ Rf7 32. Qg5+ Ke8 33. f3 Qd4+ {Centralizing the Queen with check and tempo gain.} 34. Rf2 Rc8 {All pieces must be activated.} 35. h3 Rc5 {I´m slowly improving my position.} 36. Qg3 Rg7 {Threatening White´s Queen and also aiming at White´s pawn at g2.} 37. Qb8+ Ke7 {Now can White take Black´s bishop. But it´s not really a good idea!} 38. Qxb7 Rc1+ {White´s Rook is pinned! White gave up! }
