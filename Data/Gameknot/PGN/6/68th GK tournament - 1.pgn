[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C88), closed, Leonhardt variation"]

1. e4 {I Annotate this game for two reasons: 1: I won for the first time over a 2110 rated guy 2: I kinda feel like Mikhail Tal and all of those grand masters who sacrifice in this game. you will see what I mean later on.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {So it's a Ruy Lopez.} a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 {Once black plays d6 it is a classical variation. I know some players who are as high rated as this guy who don't like to play black in this position because they feel like a target to white. But this position has been played by the best players in the world so it's nothing wrong with this position for black.} 8. c3 Na5 {This is the chigorin's variation. Nb8 is Keres i think.} 9. Bc2 c5 10. d4 Qc7 {He played Qc7. It is a playable move. There are other moves in this position as well.} 11. h3 {Just preventing the Bishop to come to g4 pinning the knight and putting pressure on d4.} O-O 12. Nbd2 {Well here i wasn't sure how to play so i decided Nd2. I have seen games where white tries to put the b-knight all the way to g3 in this position so that's pretty much what i did.} g6 {this is a common way to play with black in this position: g6,Re8,Bf8,Bg7.} 13. Nf1 {Just preparing to move my knight to g3.} Re8 14. Ng3 {I believe I played wrong here since i changed my mind afterwards. i wanted to play g4 instead so i was thinking to move the knight,play g4 and then move the knight back. But that would loose time. However,then again i dont see any flaws with Ng3,it's not a bad move.} Bf8 15. d5 {Here i decided to push on with the pawn and block his Light squared bishop. I was thinking that to much pressure was on d4 since i was planning to ignore that pawn so pushing on lets me concentrate on other stuff,like how to proceed a king side attack or something.} Bg7 16. Bd2 {well as you see this move looses time...} Nc4 17. Bc1 Nb6 18. Bd2 {I decided that i really wanted to develop the bishop somehow even if it cost me putting his knight on a better square. I was really thinking on moving the queen to c1 and have controll over the c1-h6 diagonal.} h6 {He probably knew that i was planning to move my queen behind my bishop and play Bh6 which could be dangerous for him.} 19. Qc1 {And i did it.} Kh7 {this was the point of h6. now two pieces protects h6 and if he feels threaten, Ng8 for more protection.} 20. Ne2 {Here,like i said earlier, i decided to withdraw my knight,play g4 and then play it back again to g3. it can be dangerous for black.} Nc4 {he moves back his knight. Now he wins my dark squared bishop. I didn't see that move coming and exchanging a rather passive knight for a potential dangerous dark squared bishop is a good thing i believe. Even tho black mostly plays something like Nbd7,c4,Nc5.} 21. Kh2 {well i couldn't do anything about Nxd2 so i decided to prepare g4. if i play g4 immediately then h5 and the h3 pawn would be hanging.} Nxd2 22. Qxd2 Bd7 {This move connect his rooks.} 23. Reg1 {I wanted to prepare g4 more now that i had the chance. Rooks are best behind pawns is what Dr. Tarrach said i think.} Ng8 {Over protecting his strong point and he might play f5 in the future which can tricky to meet.} 24. g4 {Now i had to play g4 stopping f5 and being aggressive.} Qc8 {if I advance my g-pawn then he'll take my h-pawn. } 25. Rg2 {I wasn't sure how to play here so i decided that doubling the rooks makes it better for white since the a1-rook isn't doing anything anyways.} g5 {stopping the g-pawn from advancing.} 26. Rag1 f6 {Now this looks very solid for black. I wasn't sure what to play here,maybe Ng3,Nh5 would be ok to play.} 27. h4 {I decided to exchange defenders, it might be easier for a break through in this position.} Kg6 {Well this is simply over protecting again.} 28. hxg5 fxg5 {Now black can get very nasty in the f-file. He can seize it,triple his rooks+queen and maybe have a winning chance here. I wasn't sure how to play here either because Ng3 would be met by Bxg4.That's why the pawn exchange i did was probably a bad one. Some people would prefer black in this position because of the f-file. However Now I decided to take action...} 29. Nh4+ {This is a surprising move i made. I think black can defend himself against this knight sacrifice but not doing anything and just wait for black to take the f-file was not an option for me. I am very proud of this move and most of the moves black makes leads to a win for me. I kinda feel like grand masters who make sacrifices like this when i played this move.} gxh4 30. g5 {g5, advancing the pawn attacking the g-file. this is the point of the last move i made.} h5 {now black stops white from taking the g-file. the position is closed and the question is how white should proceed with his attack.} 31. f4 {i have seen in attacks and learned to try to open as many files as possible. besides i looked at other moves and thought this was the best move to play.} Bg4 {now came bishop g4. That nasty bishop can be very annoying here, This outpost is a strong one and the question is how white shall proceed with that move.} 32. Rg2xg4 {A second sacrifice by me! i decided that the bishop was annoying where it was placed and even tho i am a rook down i am confident that i will win.} hxg4 33. f5+ {This is probably the best move in this position,now i can simply take his two pawns and with seizing the h-file and two united passed pawns,i can have a winning chance in this position.} Kf7 {well 33. ... Kh5 trying to protect his g-pawn would loose after the third sacrifice 34. Ng3+ hxg3 35. Kxg3 followed by Rh1#.} 34. Rxg4 {Now with f5 i cut off his queen making it easy to take his pawns.} c4 {giving him more space} 35. Rxh4 Qc5 {Now i had to do something because Qf2+ can be draw or a loosing move in the future (due to material losses) } 36. Ng3 {moving my knight. Now my knight will participate in the battle against his king as well.} Rab8 {I think he was focusing on a counter attack,forcing me to think about the Queen side.} 37. Rh7 {I refused to think about the queen side,i could have played a3 but i guess it wouldn't make a difference after a5.} b4 38. f6 {i had to attack his king somehow. I analyzed the latest 10 moves carefully of course and i figured this move (f6) is the best of all the moves in order to mate him.} Nxf6 {well that's one way to do it. 38. bxc3 would be met by 39. Rxg7+ Kf8 40.g6 Nxf6 41. Rf7+ Kg8 42. Qh6.} 39. gxf6 {Taking Knight.} Kxf6 {Now this position might be considered a little tricky. the king side is open and very dangerous for black.} 40. Nh5+ {The best move here,winning the bishop.} Kg6 {Blunder! 40. ... Kf7 would be at least a draw after 41. Rxg7+ Kf8 42. Rg8+ Kf7 43. Rg7+ etc. and if he tries to run after 40. Nh5+ with 40. ... Ke7?? then 41. Rxg7+ Kd8 42. Qg5+ Kc8 43. Qf5+ Kd8 44. Qd7#} 41. Rxg7+ Kxh5 42. Qg5# {Yeah! my first victory against a high rated player. probably the highest victory i even have had. I am not sure if the knight sacrifice was a good one but it made me win and i am proud of it!}
