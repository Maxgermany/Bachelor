1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 {This move has a long pedigree. Aron Niemzowitsch in the 1920's, Salo Flohr in the 1930's, World Champions Tigran Petrosyan and Vassili Smyslov in the 1950's and 1960's, and in the 1980's Kasparov's predecessor as champion, Anatoli Karpov, have all made use of it. The idea is to develop the KN at KB3 and be able to reply to NxN with... NxN, thus preserving the Black pawn structure.} 5. Ng5 {Should Black now play 5... P-KR3, the knight does not have to retreat. White plays 6 N-K6!, and 6... PxN??? is answered by 7 Q-R5 ch P-N3 8 QxP mate.} Ngf6 {Kasparov develops his Knight and prevents Deep Blue from playing a future Q-R5.} 6. Bd3 {Black still cannot kick the Knight: 6... P-KR3 7 N-K6! PxN??? 8 B-N6 mate!} e6 7. Ng1f3 h6 {The most reliable move is 7... B-Q3. After 8 Q-K2, then Black can safely play ... P-KR3. } 8. Nxe6 Qe7 {The alternative, which nobody really trusts, is the immediate capture of the Knight with 8... PxN. Black did use this alternative line in Wolff vs. Zuniga (1994) and managed to win the game.} 9. O-O fxe6 {If 9... QxN? 10 R-K1 wins the Q.} 10. Bg6+ {The Black king must move, and the Black KNP is blocked, causing a severe cramping of Black's position.} Kd8 11. Bf4 {The bishop cuts across the center and aims at the Black king. 11 P-QB4 was used instead in Leko vs. Bakhtazde (1994) and White won in 22 moves. This move is equally as strong as 11 B-B4.} b5 {The first brand-new move. The idea is to prevent P-QB4 by White and play N/3-Q4. It also gives the QB some mobility.} 12. a4 {The idea is to open the QR file for White's rook.} Bb7 13. Re1 {Deep Blue continues to pile on the pressure.} Nd5 14. Bg3 Kc8 {It's a bad sign when the world champion, as early as move 14, is reduced to sliding his King one square. It means that Kasparov's position is so disorganized that useful moves can't be found.} 15. axb5 {Time to blast open the QR file.} cxb5 16. Qd3 {White develops his queen with tempo, attacking the QNP.} Bc6 {Kasparov guards the pawn and prepares a refuge at QN2 for his King.} 17. Bf5 {Simple and strong. The KP is brought under fire, and it's hard to find a defense.} exf5 {Kasparov sacrifices his Queen, hoping to break Deep Blue's attack.} 18. Rxe7 Bxe7 {What's at stake is the safety of the Black king and the supremacy of humankind. White's entire army is in play. The black forces are in disarray. The future seems bleak.} 19. c4 {Kasparov resigns. Deep Blue wins the match, 3.5-2.5. For fans of Kasparov, everything was gone with the win. (After-match analysis by Mr. Pandolfini) Why *did* Kasparov lose? Surely, he was enervated. Most authorities believe that Garri simply wore himself out. He got advantageous positions but exhausted himself in the process, working out the intricacies of unfamiliar lines. After five of these intense struggles, over a mere eight days, Kasparov had nothing left for the fateful sixth game. -- BP [My own hypothesis is that Kasparov's spirit was broken by game 5. He had what seemed a sure win stolen away when Deep Blue came up with an astonishing perpetual check after Kasparov queened a pawn in the endgame. Kasparov then had zero days rest in between Games 5 and 6, and was still in psychological shock. If he'd had a day off to regain his mental equilibrium, we might well have seen a much sharper Garri Kasparov in the decisive 6th game. -- LA]}
