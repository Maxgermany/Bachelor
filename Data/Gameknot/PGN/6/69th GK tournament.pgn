1. e4 e5 {A standard opening. Me as black. This was a must win game for me to stay in the tournement so I put in a huge amount of thinking time} 2. Bc4 Nf6 {I start with pressure on the pawn!} 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d3 {I want to take initiative early, and I go into offensive mode early.} Na5 5. Nf3 {White continues with normal development. } Nxc4 6. dxc4 {The doubled up pawns is what I want. I had hoped this move would be critical later in the game, but it did not create as much havoc for white as I had hoped.} Bb4 {I pin the knight to the rook, thinking at the time for a tripled pawn.} 7. Bd2 d6 {I open up the white squared bishop and further protect my e pawn from the anticipated exchange on c3} 8. O-O Bxc3 {white breaks the pin and i initiate the exchange} 9. Bxc3 {exchange accepted.} O-O 10. Re1 {I castle and white brings out his rook, this is where i really start using my head muscle} c6 11. h3 Be6 12. b3 {At this pont i think I have the upper hand. My main thoughts at this point were to smash my way through the h3 pawn. I intended it to happen very soon but I did not want to make a single mistake so spent a few moves removing all my weakness.} Qd7 13. a4 {I move my queen into position.} h6 {I do not attack. I see a potentially horrible attack on my e5 pawn from the knight and bishop. I also see the white knight moving to g4 after i move bxh3. This would attack my bishop and open then queens path to move onto the kings side. h6 prevents this.} 14. a5 {I don't know what white was doing here but I was thankful for it.} Rad8 {This was to free up my knight from defending the queen. White could take e5, I would retake with my pawn and leave myself vunerable to a queen exchange. I am still vunerable here but i can move my horse around now.} 15. a6 b6 {I don't think white expected me to pass on the pawn.} 16. Re3 {Whites pawns on the queen side are now pretty useless. I was really pleased with my flat pawn wall holding up everything. The wall was controlling key squares and could not be broken up as white had a locked pawn and a doubled pawn. } Qc7 17. Qe2 {I wanted to throw  a curve ball at white now so move.,,} Nh5 {I am aiming to key the knight onto f4. If white moves his g pawn out to kick me off it leaves his h pawn very vunerable. My main thought was that he has to move his queen, now giving me a bishop and a knight attack on the h pawn. (Why it was so important for me to free my knight of defensive duty).} 18. b4 Nf4 19. Qf1 {White does what I expected.} Qd7 {I move my queen on to attack the h pawn. I felt really confident at this point, a 3 piece attack on a weak point, a well placed knight and a strong pawn wall. White with a doubled pawn and no light squared bish} 20. c5 Nxh3+ {I attack. The computer puts this as a blunder. Suggesting I take the white pawn on C5. How this is a blunder but I have no idea why, it suggests moving the queen around at the back??} 21. Kh2 {I can see no other alternative for white, takng the knight would result in both defensive pawns down and a bishop attack on the queen. with black queen ready to go g4.} Nf4 {The horse takes his place again.} 22. Ng1 f6 {I did this to prepare for move 24 d5. I wanted to free the d pawn from defensive duty. Overall, my e5 pawn, while maintaining a solid centre and good defence for the knight was a high cost piece for me to maintain.} 23. g3 Ng6 {White kicks me off after protecting h square wth knight.} 24. Rd3 d5 {I move up my d pawn.} 25. cxb6 {White exchanges to his detriment, he starts to lose material now.} axb6 26. f3 d4 {I push my pawn onto the d4, a move planned since move 22.} 27. Be1 {4 main pieces on the back line, woot!} Bc4 {Big smile on my face, but kicked myself when i noticed I had this earlier, i was to focused on moving up my d pawn.} 28. c3 Bxd3 29. Qxd3 Rda8 30. c4 Qc8 {a few pawn moves and I put some pressure on whites passed pawn.} 31. b5 c5 {I fully lock up the pawn structure, hoping to just wait white out.} 32. Bd2 f5 {I start offering exchanges.} 33. Re1 f4 {I lock it up.} 34. g4 Qd8 35. Qf1 Qh4+ {Trying to get my queen behind his line.} 36. Qh3 {dont fancy a queen swap} Qf6 37. Kg2 Qd6 38. Ne2 {Want to push up the d pawn now.} d3 39. Nc3 Qd4 40. Nd5 {This sequence is good for me, and wins me another point. I know white is hoping i take the pawn, leaving him open to the fork. I also know he has not sen my counter as it is a couple of moves long.} Qxc4 41. Nxb6 {White forks,} Qc2 {I pin the bishop. White can do nothing to save it, and it if he takes my rook he exchanges a rook for a knight and a bishop.} 42. Nxa8 Qxd2+ 43. Kf1 Rxa8 {which he does.  White times out. Then re instates. I a comfortable with this position. I am particularly proud of this game. I may not have made the best moves, but I did not leave myself vunerable anywhere, assuring my house was in good order before I attacked.}
