1. c4 {I've long had a dislike for the English, enjoying tactics more than positional play I've found this opening to cater almost exclusively to the latter. However lately, after much pressure from my friends, I've started examining and playing it, finding some interest in its dynamic positions and large transpositional value. } Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 Bb4 {Some of my favorite lines for black in the English involve this move, which helps to shape the game slightly more tactically. } 4. Qc2 b6 {We start to enter less common lines, black seeks to weaken White's control of white central squares by posting his bishop on b7. Only 126 games in GK's World Database. } 5. a3 {Looking for possible Queenside expansion while gaining tempo on the Bishop, possibly preparing b4 to play Bb2. } Be7 {!? A much less common reply (only two moves in the database, while 76games have Bxc3). } 6. d4 {Grabbing more center. } Bb7 {The logical follow up to b6, however allows white to build a very strong center. Challenging White with d5 or c5 is probably better.} 7. e4 d6 {Preparing for Nbd7, we are still in the database but only barely. } 8. Bd3 {Continuing development and entrenching in the center. } Nbd7 {Of course. Black seems to be postponing castling until they can determine White's motives and then can pick a wing accordingly.} 9. e5 {Now we're in a single game in the database, the other contained 9. O-O c5 when Black castled short, produced lots of pressure after some logical seeming moves by White and won in 41 moves. That being said, castling is probably the stronger move, getting the king to safety and holding the advantage in the center. But this game will probably be more fun :) } dxe5 10. dxe5 Ng4 11. Be4 c6 {Not 11... Bxe4? 12. Qxe4 f5 13. exf6 Ngxf6 14. Qxe6 when Black isn't down much (just a pawn) but there is under considerable pressure. } 12. Bf4 {Adding protection to e5, reminiscent of lines in the Budapest Gambit. } Qc7 {Contesting that protection.} 13. O-O-O {Protecting the king as the game is about to open and controlling the file. More protection cannot be added to e5 but this move helps that goal indirectly. After 13...Ndxe5 either 14. Bg3 or 14. Kb1 removes the threat of Nd3+ getting out of the pin and winning the hanging bishop after which Black feels the power of the two bishops. 13...Nfxe5 fails faster to the strong sacrifice 14. Rxd7! Qxd7 15.Rd1} O-O-O {As played in the database game we've been following. } 14. h3 {Removing some protection of e5...} Ngxe5 {? This again allows for the rook sacrifice on d7, the database game went Nf6! when white does not wish to capture due to the discovered attack on his BSB. } 15. Rxd7 Rxd7 16. Nxe5 {? The wrong way to take back! Much stronger for white is 16. Bxe5 Bd6 17. Bxg7 Rg8 18. Bf6 Rxg2 19. Nd4 +- This move equalizes for black, and possibly even pushes the edge in that direction!} Bd6 {The correct was to punish White. } 17. Nxd7 Bxf4+ 18. Kb1 Qxd7 19. Rd1 Qe7 20. Qa4 {White's position is certainly not lost, just has to deal with being down a pawn, the pressure of two bishops, and an already weakened castled position. } Kb8 {Helps to return some edge for White. Stronger is 20...Qc5 21. Qxa7 Bb8 22. Qa4 f5 23. Bf3 Rd8 =-} 21. Bxc6 Bxc6 22. Qxc6 Rc8 23. Qe4 {Black has lost the bishop pair, pawns are equal again, and black's king is now more precariously placed than White's. =+} Bg5 {Not the strongest, which allows for tactics with the king and a strong post for the knight. } 24. Qe5+ Kb7 {?? Immediate blunder 24... Ka8 is better as this allows} 25. Ne4 {Threatening the fork at d6 while double attacking the bishop.} Rc6 26. Qxg5 f6 {Black does not want to trade down now.} 27. Qd2 Rxc4 {Losing to the same fork...} 28. Nd6+ {Black resigns. An interesting game, the sacrifice is sound and very strong, but must be followed correctly :) }
