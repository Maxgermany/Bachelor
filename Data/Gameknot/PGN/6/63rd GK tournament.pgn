1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening, one of my favorites however, i was playing black so he had to make the move.} d5 {My most usual reply to a queen's pawn opening} 2. c4 e6 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {Here, i took his Pawn, any top rated player would not recommend that, you will see the reason in the next move of white.} 4. Nc3 {Nc3. This move of white forces the black queen to move to a different square. As a result black wastes a move. White gets an advantage to develop his pieces faster than the black. I knew this thing before i played the game, still i made it. Well the blunder is yet to come.} Nc6 {Nc6?? This was the blunder i made. I didnt move my queen. This was a complete human error. I didnt notice that untill the next move.} 5. Nxd5 {As expected..} exd5 {At this point my queen was gone. I felt weak..} 6. e3 {White already had an upper hand at this stage. He was developing his pieces to finish up an already won game..} Nf6 7. Bb5 Bd6 {I knew he would definitely castle at a later stage in the game. At this point i was just expecting him to castle king side. Also i myself wanted to castle as soon as possible.} 8. Bxc6+ {Another jolt for me. Anybody would do that. Its a simple phenomenon that if you are at an advantage in a game, trade off equal pieces, this makes the opponent weaker and yourself stronger.} bxc6 {I was lagging on pieces, and my pawn structure had also shattered. Anybody looking at the board would definitely say that i have lost the game.} 9. Ne2 {Planning to castle..} O-O 10. O-O Ba6 {Although, i had planned an attack towards his king side, but i knew i cant make a direct attack. Plus i also had in mind not to let him move his queen. I was safe as long as his queen was at d1.} 11. Re1 {He freed his rook which was pinned in the earlier move.. i expected this.} Rab8 {As i didnt have my queen, so i was bound to take the help of my rooks..} 12. a3 {This was one wrong move he made. He had moved his pawn to a3 fearing my bishop attack at b4. However, he had other alternatives to defend his rook if i would have made that move. But this a3 move gave me an opportunity to launch a bishop-rook attack.} Bc4 13. Ng3 Rb3 14. e4 {He made this move to free his pieces to launch an attack on me, however he made a mistake. His e4 pawn was supported by his knight at g3 and Rook at e1. I could easily take this e4 pawn by my Knight at f6, if i traded his g3 knight by my bishop at d6. But at this stage he would not have been expecting this, as he thought i would not afford to lose one more piece and that too a bishop (which are better in endgames than knights).} Bxg3 {But i took this and the sequence of moves followed, i had done this to gain a positional advantage in the game. } 15. fxg3 Nxe4 {See, as i said positional advantage. I had launched an attack with a rook, bishop and a knight. And with all this i had some how restricted his queen's movement, thus not letting him make an attack.} 16. Re3 {He started feeling the threat of my attack, so wanted to break it by trading my rook. Another trading that anyone would happily do when in an advantage} Rb6 {I couldnt afford to lose my rook now} 17. b4 {With this he blocked my rook's attack. } Re8 {I took out another rook to attack. I had no option but to continue my attack. (Offense is the best way of defense). I was very happy as long as i was keeping his queen away from my king.} 18. Qg4 {Qg4! A good move by him. This ove had many advantages for him. 1. He was trying to launch an attack on my king. 2. He had enough support with his next move Rf3. This would have brought his Rook as well as Bishop at c1 into the attack. 3. I was not very well in a situation to defend my king if he would have done that as my Rook at b6 and Bishop at c4 were not in a position to defend my king. 4. In a way my Rook at e8 way pinned to rank-8 (base rank), because if i moved it from rank-8 i was to be checkmated at Qc8#} Re6 {Re6! A good move from my end. This was blocking his queen's attack at c8, plus my rook was ready for a front end defense, also was giving me time to bring my pieces to defend my king} 19. Qf5 {I think Rf3 was a better move. But i think he had something else in his mind, maybe he wanted to attack my f7 pawn with his next move as Rf3. Well whatever i got the time i wanted to bring my pieces to defense.} Rb8 20. Rf3 {Exactly as i thought, he was planning to attack my f7 pawn, but by now i was well equipped to handle this attack. See what i move next. This was his first and last attack on me, because after this he didn't get an opportunity to defend himself.} Nd6 {Nd6!! Now this move protects my f7 pawn, and on the other hand forces his queen to move back to g4, as moving his queen to f4 will restrict his bishop} 21. Qg4 {Now from next move onwards, see my selection of moves, he never got a chance to defend his king.} Re1+ 22. Kf2 Rf1+ 23. Ke3 Re8+ 24. Kf4 Re4+ 25. Kg5 h6+ 26. Kh5 g6+ {I wanted him to take my h6 pawn, so that i could have got his queen without giving away my rook, but he didnt} 27. Kh4 g5+ 28. Kh3 Rxg4 29. Kxg4 Be2 {pinned his rook} 30. h4 f5+ 31. Kh5 Kh7 {His rook at f3 was gone too. He knew he was not going to last for long. So he resigned. }
