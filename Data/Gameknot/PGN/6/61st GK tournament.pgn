1. e4 {Hey this is a game that i played for the 61st Gk Tournament, round 5. It was a strong match with a tough opponent. Comments about the game are really welcomed! So i played with black ( i like white more but what can i do?). The game started with e4.} e5 {I played e5. I don't often play the sicilian cause e5 suits me better.} 2. d4 {And then d4. Nice though most prefer to play Nf3.} exd4 {I accepted the challenge and took the pawn.} 3. Qxd4 {Typical reply.} Nc6 {Open the knight and push the queen back.} 4. Qd5 {Instead he played Qd5. I think Qd1 is better.} Nf6 {I open the other one knight. I wanted to develop all my pieces and hold a strong position.} 5. Qc4 {Again not the greatest position for his queen i think.} Be7 {I wanted to castled and though the position is quite pathetic i think is the best.} 6. Nf3 {he developed the knight!} O-O {I castled and try now to develop the rest of my pieces.} 7. c3 {c3? Playing Nc3 or Bd3 is better i think.} d5 {And now d5. Good move as i open the diagon for my bishop and also push the queen and the centre.} 8. exd5 {He took the pawn.} Nxd5 {And i took it back with my knight.} 9. g3 {g3? For me it's a bad move but ok if he's gonna play then Bg2.} Re8 {Still his king is exposed and i wanted to check and attack( generally).} 10. Nbd2 {He should have played Be2 i guess.} Bc5+ {And check.} 11. Ne4 {He played Ne4. Maybe it was the greatest reply.} Bb6 {I put the bishop back.} 12. Bg2 {Bg2? I think he's ignoring the threat coming from my rook.} f5 {f5! I think that was strong!} 13. Nh4 {He's not castled yet.} fxe4 {I took the knight and i should say i have a good position.} 14. O-O {He castled after many moves he spent.} Na5 {I push the queen. Nothing serious.} 15. Qe2 {He put it back.} Nf6 {Now i want to protect the pawn so Nf6 would be a good move.} 16. Be3 {Exchanging bishops? I didn't care actually.} Bg4 {Threatening the queen.} 17. Qb5 {Maybe Qc2 would be better.} a6 {a6 for queen.} 18. Qa4 Be2 {I played Be2 for both rook and then queen.} 19. Rfe1 {Typical.} Bb5 {Threaten his queen. I think he did not have a clear plan on his mind. And he's a piece down.} 20. Qc2 Nc4 {Open the knight. I wanted to be in square d6.} 21. Bf4 Bc6 {Protect the pawn.} 22. Rad1 {He's trying to attack to my queen. Good move.} Qe7 {The best square i guess.} 23. b3 Nd6 {I put it back where i wanted.} 24. c4 Ba5 {Push thee rook.} 25. Re2 {Logical.} Ng4 {Maybe i should have played another move.} 26. a3 {Now he wants the piece back.} Nf7 {So i played Nf7 proteck both knight and bishop later.} 27. b4 {b4. Good move.} Bb6 {Logical.} 28. Qc3 {Now he wants to push the g7 square.} Qe6 {I played with my queen to prevent his knight move to f5.} 29. c5 {Typical to put my bishop back.} Ba7 {Logical move. Now it's awkard there.} 30. Bh3 {He wants to push my knight. Good move.} g5 {So i played g5 instead.} 31. Bc1 {Bad move i guess. f3 would be better for him.} gxh4 {I took the other knight too.} 32. gxh4 {Logical.} Qg6 {There my queen is in a strong position.} 33. Bb2 {Obviously that move is good but now i think it's too late.} Ne3+ {Check.} 34. Kh1 {Only place to go.} Nxd1 {I took his rook.} 35. Qd4 {Bad move again.} e3+ {And anothe check in which he resigned. I hope you like my game!}
