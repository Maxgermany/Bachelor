1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c3 Bf5 4. Bg5 e6 5. Nbd2 c5 6. e3 Nc6 {Presses d4, but...} 7. Bxf6 {White sees that may attack black on queen's side and makes the exchange.} Qxf6 {Capturing with the pawn seems safer.} 8. Bb5 {White attempts to put black under pressure.} Be7 {Rc8 seems better.} 9. Qa4 {White presses the diagonal a4-e8.} Kd7 {Black seems very stingy here. Castling keeps black in play.} 10. Bxc6+ {White punishes black's poor defending.} Kc7 {Obviously the pawn can not capture the bishop because of 11.Ne5 and the Queen captures the pawn in c6 } 11. Ne5 {Bishop is safe. White centralized knight.} a6 {Last defensive chance or last mistake?} 12. Bxb7 {Black resigns. }
