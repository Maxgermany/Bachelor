1. d4 f5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {on 2...g6, trying for a Leningrad Dutch, there's the interesting 3.h4!, whipping up a quick K-side attack. } 3. Bg5 {And here's the move I want to try. The "recommended" line for white is to fianchetto on the king side and put pawns on c4 & d4.} e6 4. Nbd2 Be7 {Black's other option is 4...d5.} 5. Bxf6 Bxf6 6. e4 {The point of this variation - white now gains all sorts of space in the center. } fxe4 {White gets a clear advantage after this. Black's best try is probably to leave the tension in the center unresolved and play 6...O-O and 7...d5.} 7. Nxe4 d6 {?! this creates a weakness on e6.  Perhaps black wants to play ...e5 next? } 8. Bd3 Nc6 9. c3 {Now if black plays 9...O-O, my plan is to castle long and attack on the King side. 9.c3, besides supporting d4 and preventing ...Nb4, also readies "plan B" - expand on the Q-side - if black delays O-O.} Bd7 10. Qe2 {still preparing to castle long ...} Qe7 {But black makes a waiting move. } 11. O-O {I can't wait forever, so time for Plan B. } O-O {Clever - avoids the immediate K-side attack by waiting for white to castle first. } 12. b4 {Plan B is under way.} g6 {Sealing off the b1-h7 diagonal} 13. b5 Na5 {Poorly placed; perhaps 13...Nd8 instead, with ...Nf7 next to support ....e5.} 14. Nxf6+ {Getting rid of black's most active piece. His remaining B + N have no useful moves.} Qxf6 15. Nd2 {Preparing f4, after which the pawn on e6 becomes a permanent liability. } b6 {?! this is black's last chance to play ...e5. After 15...e5 16.dxe5 Qxe5 17.Qxe5 dxe5, white has a clear edge, but it's still anybody's game.  } 16. f4 Rae8 17. Rae1 Qg7 {Probably entertaining ideas of ...e5, but it's too late for that} 18. Ne4 {The N is on its way to g5, where it increases the pressure on e6.} d5 {This is a serious positional error, as now white's N will become a monster on e5. Surprisingly, GK's computer doesn't see anything wrong with this move. I would move 18...Nb7, trying for counterplay with ...c5. Note that 18...e5 loses to 19.fxe5 dxe5 20.dxe5, creating a strong passed pawn (and 20...Rxd5? or 20...Qxd5 21.Nf6+! wins).} 19. Ng5 h6 {? This fatally weakens g6. This is the losing move for black. Black needs to create counterplay with something like 19...c5. (GK recommends 19...c6, which is the same idea).} 20. Nf3 {Re-routing to the excellent e5 outpost.} Re7 21. Ne5 {The weakness on g6 is glaring.} Be8 {Trying to defend the weak g6 square} 22. Rf3 {! This obvious rook lift gives white a K-side attack after all. } Nb7 {? I was expecting 22...Rf6, though black is still in a bind after 23.Rg3 (the GK computer recommends 22...Rf6 23.Nxg6, which probably wins a pawn or two, but I think black has more serious problems after 22...Rf6 23.Rg3)} 23. Bxg6 Kh8 {or 23...Bxg6 24.Nxg6 with too many threats} 24. Rg3 Qf6 25. Bxe8 {25.Qh5 is playable right away, and is probably a quicker win, but I didn't see it until after I had already played BxB.} Rexe8 {? 25...Rfxe8 26.Qh5 Rg8 27.Ng6+ etc. black is still lost, but avoids the forced mate (which I missed, so I guess it didn't matter in the end).} 26. Qh5 {The prosaic 26.Ng6+ also wins, but I was looking for a mating attack. This actually does lead to a forced mate, but I missed it during the game. } Rfg8 27. Nd7 Qf5 {On 27...Qxf4 28.Rf1 settles matters} 28. Qxh6+ Qh7 29. Qf6+ {According to the GK computer, I miss a mate-in-8 here starting with 29.Rxe6 ... } Rg7 30. Nf8 {Black resigns here. Black can avoid mate with 30...Rxf8 31.Qxf8+ Rg8 32.Rxg8+ Qxg8 33.Qxg8+ Kxg8 but loses too much material in the process.}
