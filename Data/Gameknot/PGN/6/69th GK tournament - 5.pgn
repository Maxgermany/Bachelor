1. e4 {Hey everyone! This is a tournament game I played recently. The opponent resigned prematurely, but I was wondering if the experts could comment on my mistakes.} e5 2. Bc4 {He he plays the bc4. I looked at the opponents history and he seems to favor the 4 move checkmate.} c6 {In preparation for this, I start to develop my pieces slowly.} 3. Qf3 {As I said, he pulled out his Queen, and i have to block the 4 move checkmate.} Nf6 {This is the usual preventative measure against the 4 move. If anyone uses a different method, just let me know. I like this method because it also develops pieces, but I'm open to suggestion.} 4. d3 {I think he intends to challenge my knight with the bishop, but I don't see what damage that could do.} h6 {But since it was a tournament game, I decided to take preventative measures. I played h6 to block that attack.} 5. Ne2 {Here he obviously intends to castle, which gives me 2 free moves to begin to develop and build an attack.} Bc5 {This is not intended to be an amateur move, but I like the position of Bc5. It takes control of the middle of the board, and also attacks a weak position in white's line of pawns.} 6. h3 {I assume this move has a duel purpose: It blocks the advance of the knight, while also preventing the checkmate of the King behind three pawns later in the game.} O-O {Now that I am certain he will castle on this side, I decide to focus my attack on the Kingside pawns.} 7. Qg3 {I looked at his profile, and he also favors playing Bh6. This movement of the Queen prepares that move, because the pawn is now pinned.} Nh5 {Here is where I throw him a line, hoping he would take it. In the next few moves I will gain a significant advantage because of a move that appears to be a mistake.} 8. Qxe5 {It appears as if I just gave him a pawn, but he actually fell into a trap. I can now play Qa5+.} Qa5+ 9. Bd2 {This was his last chance to prevent the loss of his Queen. Had he moved his King instead, he would have prevented a check with Bxf2+.} Bxf2+ {Now he is in check, and his Queen is exposed, unprotected. His main option is Kxf2. I can now capture his queen and gain a significant advantage.} 10. Kxf2 Qxe5 {At this point I thought I had it locked up, but it turned out differently than I expected.} 11. Nbc3 {He is blocking Qxb2, which would expose his rook, although he could have played bc3 in response, with his bishop protected, but that was his choice.} d6 12. Raf1 b5 {The last two moves were unimportant, just building a position on either side. I have now challenged his bishop, forcing him to retreat. His only option is Bb3.} 13. Bb3 Re8 {I can now prevent him from taking pieces with his e4 pawn, because I have mated the rook and Queen. I later decide to capitalize on this weakness in his defense.} 14. g4 {He has now challenged my knight, but I don't see any danger in it.} Nf6 15. Ke1 {This is where I have him cornered, although I did not deliver checkmate in this game.} b4 {The knight had become a nuisance, so I forced it to Na4, to give myself more space and to keep him on the outside of the board. His knight is trapped on the side now.} 16. Na4 d5 {At this point, the capture of the black pawn would have resulted in checkmate, because it would open up the e file, where my rook and Queen had mated. I was simply testing for the easy checkmate.} 17. Bf4 {The opponent now challenges my Queen, and due to the fact that I would like to keep this strong position, I can only move backwards.} Qe7 {The position I chose also provided me with a position that prevents Nc5, protecting my position on his outside knight.} 18. e5 {He smartly attacks my knight, and I need to move it. But I also have the option of leaving it unattended, because the checkmate is still looming on the e file.} Na6 19. Rh2 {Now I need to move my knight, because he has defended against the checkmate. He has also inadvertently given himself a potential attacking position for later on in the game.} Nh7 20. Nd4 Bb7 21. Re2 {Pieces move around, most of it insignificant. But as you surely noticed, my bishop now protects the lone pawn at c6, and he has moved his rook to the e file. My strong position has faltered.} Qh4+ {I decide to put him in check, then take the easy pawn to increase my material advantage. This is where I think I made the mistake.} 22. Rff2 Qxh3 23. Nf5 {It became obvious to me that if I took the second pawn, he would fork my Queen and King, although my pawn protected it. But by taking his knight with the pawn, the g file then became clear. This was something I did not notice until it was too late.} Qxg4 24. Nxh6+ gxh6 {Now, if you notice, Rg2 now claims my Queen. I decide to exchange knight and rook for Queen, and given my material advantage I had no qualms over it, although it was not a conscious decision.} 25. Rfg2 Qxg2 26. Rxg2+ Kh8 27. Bxh6 Rxe5+ {We exchange pawns and I prepare to attempt a checkmate. Had he moved Re2, he would have been better off, although he did have a good position on me.} 28. Kd2 Rg8 {Now I propose the exchange of Rooks. No problem yet.} 29. Rf2 {He seems to want that pawn, and since he is down in material score, that is a smart avoidance. But I now see the traditional rook rook checkmate on the back rows.} Rh5 {Had he taken the pawn with his rook, I could have delivered checkmate with the two rooks. (30...Rg2, 31... Rh1) But he should not take the bate, because that would be a beginners mistake. Although his one saving grace was that he could move Kc3 or Ke3 should i put him in check with one of my rooks.} 30. Rxf7 {One aspect I had forgot at that point was that the King could escape at c3, e3. So I move the pawn forward (d4) to prevent that situation.} d4 31. Rxh7+ {Here he has now made a fair exchange of Rook and Bishop for Rook and knight. Due to the fact that I am ahead, I have no worries at this point.} Kxh7 {I take rook, he takes rook.} 32. Bxg8+ {Now I have two available bishops. I decided to take the white one, because the dark bishop only has one option, that option being Bf4. The white bishop could have done more damage than the dark one.} Kxg8 {Here he resigns, for no obvious reason. I was wondering if the pros could review the game and comment where necessary. Hope you enjoyed it!}
