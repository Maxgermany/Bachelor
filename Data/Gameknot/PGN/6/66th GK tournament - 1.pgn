1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. e3 c5 {Excited to play in my first GK tourney, I start out ambitiously.} 4. c3 Bf5 {!?? I was trying to make a reasonable move that was not in the DB, but next time I think I'll just steer the game into more familiar lines. This should be playable, but pressure on d5 and b7 make it dangerous for Black. …Bg4, …e6, …Nc6 and …Qb6 are all natural and good.} 5. Qb3 {! The most challenging.} Qb6 {? This move is sufficient in many analogous positions, but here c5 is undefended. …Qc8 is not very exciting, but it seems best.} 6. dxc5 {! Winning a pawn and forcing off the Queens at the same time.} Qxb3 7. axb3 {Black is down a clear pawn, with little prospect of ever getting it back. Whites two pairs of doubled pawns give some drawing hopes, however, and there is quite a bit of play left in the game.} Nc6 {…Nbd7 would force b4 right away and allow me to play …e5, but the Knight would then have nowhere to go.} 8. b4 {?! This is not yet necessary. With 8. Nf3, White develops, stops …e5, and reserves b4 for when Black has committed himself by …e6.} e5 9. Bg3 Be7 {This impressive center is a lot less potent without a Queen to provide attacking chances. White is clearly better, and Black is fighting to draw.} 10. Nd2 O-O 11. Ngf3 Nd7 {11. …e5 12. Nd4 held no interest for me. Now my Knight is passive, but I clear f6 for the Bishop.} 12. Bb5 {Adding more pressure to e5.} Bf6 13. O-O Rfd8 14. Nh4 {?! An odd move. 14. Rfe1 ∆ e4 is more to the point.} Be6 15. e4 {! This move would have more force with the Knight on f3 and the Rook on e1, but it is still an excellent way to break up Black's center.} a6 {Black must make the Bishop choose before clarifying the center. 15. …d4 16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. cxd4 exd4 18. Nf3 rounds up the d-pawn, while 15. …dxe4 16. Nxe4 Be7 17. Nd6 is no fun.} 16. exd5 Bxd5 17. Bc4 {Forcing a trade.} Nf8 {At least Black will get the d-file.} 18. Bxd5 Rxd5 19. Nc4 {! Tightening White's grip.} Rb8 {Anticipating Nd6.} 20. Rad1 {! And bye-bye d-file.} Rbd8 21. Ne3 {21. Nd6 Rxe1 22. Rxe1 Rd7 would be even better, but White still has everything under control.} Rd5d2 22. Rxd2 Rxd2 23. Nc4 {! Ejecting the Rook. Now …Re2 is tempting, with the threat of …Re4, but Nf3 leaves the Rook dangerously short of squares.} Rd5 24. Nf5 g6 25. Nfe3 Rd7 26. Rd1 {! And more exchanges.} Rxd1+ 27. Nxd1 Nd7 {Note at this point that, though White has perhaps not played with 100% accuracy, he has skillfully eliminated all of Black's best cheapo drawing tactics. There will be no Rook endgames, no Bishops of opposite colors, and there are still plenty of pawns on both sides of the board. Black now wants to try and advance the Kingside pawns, hoping first of all to exchange off as many pawns as possible and second of all to possibly get a passer of his own. At the same time, he needs to keep the Queenside pawns blockaded and deal with the threatened intrusion on d6.} 28. f3 {!? A clever way to activate the Knight. Nd6 right away is fine, too.} Kf8 29. Nf2 Be7 30. Ne4 {Aiming twice for d6.} f5 31. Ned6 b6 {The only way to break White's vicegrip on the position also trades off a set of doubled pawns.} 32. cxb6 Nxb6 33. Nxb6 Bxd6 34. Nc4 Bc7 {So now we see the character of this endgame: White has 3-vs-1 on the Queenside, but his pawns are doubled and awkward to get moving. Black has 4-vs-3 on the Kingside but has a hard time making much of it and will have to do a lot of defending.} 35. Kf1 Ke7 36. Ke2 Ke6 37. Kd3 g5 38. Bf2 h5 {The further advanced the pawns are, the more likely Black can tie White pieces down to the Kingside.} 39. Na3 {! making way for the b-pawn's advance. } e4+ {!? I thought this was very clever at the time, but White retains all of his advantage with precise play. Perhaps …Bd6 was better, holding the pawns due to 40. b4 Bxa3 41. bxa3 (bxc6? Bxb2 and now Black is even better) axb3 = The Black b-pawn holds back both its White counterparts. After 39. …Bd6 White can play Nc2 with the idea of supporting the lead b-pawn with either Be1 or Bc4, and then playing c4.} 40. fxe4 Ne5+ {The point – Black gets his pawn back, but nothing more.} 41. Ke2 {! Trying to hold onto the pawn is no good: 41. Ke2 Ng4+ 42. Ke2 (Kf3? fxe4+) Nxf2 43. exf5+ Kxf5 44. Kxf2 Bxh2 45. g3 h4 and Black's pawns are just as dangerous as White's, while the Bishop is obviously superior to the Knight. Or, 41. Kd4?? Bb6#} fxe4 42. h3 {! Otherwise either …Ng4 or …Nd6 will win a pawn for real.} Nd3 43. Be3 Nf4+ 44. Kf1 {! White has kept everything together and will slowly drive Black back. First, the threat of g3 provokes a concession.} g4 45. hxg4 hxg4 {Black has managed to exchange some pawns and even create a passed pawn on e4, but the Kingside pawns are now firmly blockaded and the initiative passes to White.} 46. b5 {! Without further ado.} axb5 47. Nxb5 Be5 48. Nd4+ Kd5 49. b3 Nd3 50. c4+ {! The Black King is short of squares.} Kd6 51. Nb5+ Kc6 52. Ke2 {Waste of time, but no damage done.} Nf4+ 53. Kf1 Nd3 54. Na3 {Organizing a further advance.} Bd6 {Aiming for a blockade on the dark squares.} 55. Nc2 Bc5 {? This Bishop will just get forced back.} 56. Ke2 {! After Bxc5 Kxc5, progress is more difficult.} Bd6 57. Nd4+ Kb6 58. Ne6+ Ka5 {! Going for Black's best bet, occupying b4. Still should be insufficient.} 59. c5 {!? A sharp line that shows that gives Black no time for …Kb4. On the other hand, the connected passed pawns now begin to get separated and harder to defend.  Ng5, simply going after the e-pawn, also deserved consideration.} Be5 60. c6 {? In hindsight, though this move looks scary, I think it is the reason Black could escape with a draw. The pawn now gets too advanced and, although Black must play extremely carefully, it is eventually lost. 60. Bd2+ Kb5 (Nb4? 61. c6! and Black loses a piece) 61. b4!? with the idea of 61. …Nxb4? 62. Bxb4 Kxb4 63. c6! and stopping the pawn will cost a Bishop. If Black can find a way to hold against this line, however, then perhaps we must go even further back to find a win for White.  } Ka6 {Forced, or else the pawn goes through.} 61. Ng5 {! And now, White switches the attack to Black's advanced, neglected Kingside pawns. 61. c7 Kb7 is pointless, of course.} Nf4+ {At least I can force a B-for-N trade and then win the c-pawn, but e5 is doomed and g5 is not far behind.} 62. Bxf4 Bxf4 63. Nxe4 Be5 {63. …Kb3 loses to Nf6 64. g3? Nd5+} 64. Nf2 {? Going after my last pawn. It was more challenging to play Kd3, though, and focus on shepherding home the remaining Queenside pawn. This would be similar to the actual game continuation, except that there would be an extra pair of pawns on the board to increase the winning chances.} g3 65. Ne4 Kb5 66. Kf3 Kxc6 67. Nxg3 Kb5 {I almost resigned instead of playing this move. Thank goodness I didn't! It is so easy to miss all the multitude of resources which are hidden in seemingly terrible positions. Here, even (temporarily) two pawns down in a simplified endgame, it seems that Black can draw no matter what White does!} 68. Nh5 {At this point, I thought that White had just thrown the game away. I wrote: "68. Ne4! is the key, refusing to abandon the b-pawn so easily. 68. Ne4 Kb4 69. Nd2 Bc3 70. Ke2 and if Black trades pieces and wins the b-pawn, then the g-pawn Queens. Otherwise, White will bring the King around to c2, switch the Knight to the Kingside, and Black cannot stop both pawns." Thanks to nuntar's input, I now realize that 69. …Kc3! should hold here. Therefore, we have to look earlier for where White could have saved the win.} Kb4 69. Ke4 Bh8 {! Plenty of other Bishop moves are good, but the exclam is for instructive value: this move goes to the heart of the position. To win, White needs to get the g-pawn to g8 without ever allowing Black to sac the Bishop for it. As long as the Bishop stays on the h8-a1 diagonal, the only way to prevent that sac is by blocking the diagonal with Nf6. Thus, Black puts the Bishop "inside" f6 so that White cannot block the Bishop without first ejecting it from h8. To do this, the White King must go to h7 or g8, where it no longer can support a Knight on f6. Since the White King cannot control h8 and f6 at once, White will need to bring up the pawn to support f6. That will give the Black King time to get back and control f6 himself, after which the Bishop cannot be blocked at all.} 70. g4 Kxb3 71. Kf5 Kc4 {The King hurries back to help control f6, after which the draw is assured for the reasons already stated at move 69.} 72. g5 Kd5 73. Kg6 {!? Tricksy! White has found a new way to deal with the Bishop: he threatens Nf6 first, and then Kh7, forcing a trade into a won King and Pawn endgame. Unfortunately for White, however, Black will simply retreat his Bishop for just long enough for the King to arrive and help out.} Bd4 {! Nf6 is now met with Ke3 and the pawn is tied to the defense of the Knight.} 74. Kf7 Ke5 {! It doesn't matter that the King blocks the Bishop temporarily. Black threatens to install the King on f4, forcing g3 and keeping the Knight of f6 forever.} 75. Nf6 Kf5 76. Nh7 {Otherwise we just repeat moves. 76. g6? Bxf6 is no help, of course.} Bc3 77. g6 Bb2 78. Nf8 Bc3 79. Ne6 {And White, seeing that there is no way to advance further, offered a draw. A very lucky escape against the top seed in my tournament group! At the same time, it teaches us to keep struggling as long as there are any chances left at all.}
