1. e4 {i like the Spanish opening so i played e4} e5 2. Nf3 d5 {oO i don't know the name of this opening but i know that black wastes many tempi and white can develop ## edit: it's the Elephant Gambit} 3. exd5 Qxd5 4. Nc3 {see? 2 white knights came out while black just developed its queen, which is now attacked} Qc5 5. d4 {to undo black's opening i thought a queen trade might be good to increase my development advantage} exd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 {black is undeveloped while white has opened the table} Bc5 8. Be3 {a trade on d4 is good for white because of the threat on g7/h8 from the white bishop} Nf6 {undoing the threat} 9. Bc4 {next development} O-O {black castles...} 10. O-O-O {white too but with a more active postion of the rook} Bxd4 11. Bxd4 {if i trade on f6 the g-line would be open which is good for white} Ng4 {i don't know what the intention is but maybe the fork on f2 if i move my bishop from d4 away} 12. Rd3 {trying to threaten with Rg3 followed by 14.Rxg7+ Kh8 15.Rg6+ f6 16.Bxf6+ Rxf6 17.Rxf6 with material advatage for white} g6 13. Nd5 {all my plans destroyed -.- but why not try to play Nd5 and threaten a mate?} Na6 {strange move...} 14. Ne7# {mate}
