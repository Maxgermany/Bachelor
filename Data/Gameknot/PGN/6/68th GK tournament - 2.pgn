1. e4 {In this game I recovered from a very bad start and ended the game with rather strong moves.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {White starts with the Ruy Lopez(Spanish game).} Bc5 {My usual response.} 4. c3 d6 5. d4 {White makes good moves with an early attack the sets me a bit off balance as I'm only playing to his tune.} exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ {Trying to control the game with a minor yet insignificant attack.} 7. Kf1 {The most common move is 7.Nc3 but white has other ideas} Bd7 8. Qa4 {White attacks the black bishop which is only defended by the knight.} Nge7 9. d5 {I didn't quite see the pawn move. White is sure to gain.} a6 {Trying to confuse white but it's too late at this stage.} 10. Bxc6 bxc6 11. Qxb4 cxd5 {At this stage I decided to keep fighting and taking any little advantages I had} 12. exd5 Nxd5 {Gaining a pawn to reduce the deficit} 13. Qe4+ Ne7 14. Nc3 O-O 15. Ng5 {White's attack starts. At this point I'm down in pieces but there is one principle I've always believed. Even if one may be down in pieces what matters is how many each player is using during the game. At this point white's rooks are inactive and would take longer bring in the game than black's.} Bf5 {The best form of defense...} 16. Qf3 c5 {Opening up for the queen. Opening up for more pieces.} 17. g3 {White decides to safeguard his rook while introducing a rook.} Re8 {Also introducing a rook. } 18. Kg2 h6 19. Nge4 d5 20. Nxc5 {Believe it or not this was a sacrifice to gain position. At this point my game is becoming stronger with emphasis on positional play.} Qc8 {A better move if you can see it fully. There is a good attack for black which is also position oriented.} 21. b4 {Of course the knight has to be protected.} Bh3+ 22. Kg1 Ng6 {The white rook is blocked from being introduced into the game while at this point the rook is threatening a mate.} 23. Bb2 Ne5 24. Qxd5 {Interestingly, yet another deliberate sacrifice though I didn't think white would go for it.} Qf5 {This is a very powerful combination threatening a mate. Actually, I didn't think white had a reply to it even after analyzing.} 25. f4 {Good move. I didn't see it before. } Rad8 {Trying to force white into submission. I was sure this time there was no possible response to this. } 26. Qe4 {A very good move. I actually thought my attack was done for and white would now regain the advantage. I took quite some time on this one.} Rd2 {I tried moving every piece in my mind before getting to this move. I guess that's what GM's do. } 27. Qxf5 {White didn't even realize what was happening with this fast response.} Nf3# {A very good opponent beaten by positional chess. This was my immortal.}
