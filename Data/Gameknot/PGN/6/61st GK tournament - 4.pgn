[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {I aim for the opening I know best as White, the Stonewall.  White seeks a pawn formation:  c3, d4, e3, f4, the K N eyeing e5.} Nf6 {Sometimes I play a Trompolski here (Bg5), but only against weaker opponents.} 2. e3 {I play the passive looking e3, opening the diagonal for the Bishop and preparing f4.} c5 {This wasn't according to plan.  White hoped for e6 or d5.  But the Stonewall plan against cd is ed! opening the diagonal for the Bishop.} 3. c3 {The usual order for White is Bd3, but given Black's surprise 2nd move, White gets in the critical Q side pawn formation, still planning to retake on d4 with the e pawn.} e6 {Black returns the initiative to White.  Perhaps better was Nc3.  White likes to see a pawn on the e6 square because it blocks the c8 Bishop, which often frustrates plans by developing to g4.} 4. Bd3 {White's setup is according to plan.  The order was changed, and Black looks a little awkward now with the c5 pawn.  White wants to continue f4, Nf3 and 0-0.  } d5 5. Nd2 {Because of Black's move, White prevents Black from occupying e4 with a Knight.} c4 {Now this pawn thrust is a waste of time.  Black forces the Bishop to a square it wanted to go to.} 6. Bc2 Nc6 {The Knight move prepares e5, which White immediately prevents while completing the Stonewall formation.} 7. f4 Bd6 {The Bishop is biting on granite.  White has an easy development.} 8. Ngf3 O-O 9. O-O b5 {This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.  } 10. Ne5 {Now Black can't play NxN because of the pawn fork.  And an exchange on e5 will open the f-file.} Bb7 11. Qe1 {White prepares the advance of the e pawn.  In some instances, White will defend e5 by playing the d2 N to f3.  In others, White plays a "rook lift" (Rf3-h3).} Nd7 {Black will often try f7-f5, a counter Stonewall.  Black's pieces are clustered on the Q-side whereas Whites target the poorly defended King.  Black's latest move removed a key defender from the K side.} 12. e4 {This opens the dark Bishop's diagonal, with the two Bishops raking the K side.  White doesn't give Black time to play f5.} Re8 {This move by Black I don't understand.} 13. Ndf3 {White defends e5 with a piece.} f6 {Black forces the "bone in his throat" to move.  (This phrase more properly applies to a N on the 6th rank.)} 14. Nxc6 {Circumstances have forced a change in plans.  White plays to force open the f-file.} Bxc6 15. e5 fxe5 16. fxe5 Be7 {f-file open.  The Black King is denuded.} 17. Qg3 {Brings force to bear on the vital region.} Nf8 {A haste retreat, to an unfavorable square.  White's next moves reduce Black's defenses, and game time.  The as yet unmoved Bishop on c1 will be exchanged for the developed Bishop on e7, and the White Knight assumes a threatening post.} 18. Bg5 Bxg5 19. Nxg5 {Everything is as before except the dark Bishops are gone and the Knight has advanced to a very threatening spot.  The f7 square is in bad shape, and h7 is doubly attacked.} g6 {Black chooses to blunt the attack on h7.  This may not have been critical at this time.  Better would have ben Re7.} 20. Nf7 Qe7 21. Rf6 {White puts more pressure on the g6 pawn.} Kg7 22. Qg5 {Black tried to defend g6 with his K, but now White threatens check on h6.} Kg8 23. Raf1 {White brings over his last undeveloped piece to join the party.} Rec8 {Another curious move by Black.  Now White works out  a little combination.} 24. Bxg6 hxg6 25. Rxg6+ Nxg6 26. Qxg6+ Kf8 27. Nd6+ {and my opponent resigned.  This won game is against the highest rated player I've played on GK.  Unfortunately, my other game is not going so well.}
