[Opening "Sicilian defence (B40)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. Nc3 a6 {Standard Sicilian opener.  As I always aim for the Sicilian Kan as black.} 4. e5 {Very surprised and really never play against an early advance to e5.  Out of the opening book but common sense leads to targeting it.} Nc6 5. b3 Qc7 6. Bb2 Nxe5 {Gladly take the pawn and while it does give him some diagonals to work with, I'm fairly confident in my position and always love being up on material.} 7. Be2 Nf6 8. O-O Neg4 {Repositioning the knight} 9. h3 {pretty sure this wasn't his best option.  Maybe d3?  Either way I'm not thrilled with white's position if I were playing as white.} Nh6 10. d3 Be7 {Just looking to develop and defend with an eye toward castling.} 11. Ne4 Nf5 {A beautiful outpost for the knight as white can't chase it away without exposing the king.  Most certainly don't want to move Nxe4 as white would surely follow with Bxg7 and taking on h6 the following move giving white much better board positioning.} 12. Nxf6+ Bxf6 13. Bxf6 gxf6 {Saw it playing into this when I had originally made my prior knight move and while at first glance one might think black has a ruined pawn structure, but this is a beautiful set up for an attack on white's king.} 14. c4 {This had to be a mistake as it weakens the d pawn and permits black to rest his knight on d4 should white move his knight.} Rg8 15. Nd2 {Probably is looking at moving Bf3 to sure up his king-side defenses.} Qf4 {I'm just trying to get my queen into an attacking position.  Ideally I was aiming to try to grab the h3 pawn with the g pawn currently pinned.} 16. Ne4 {Threatening with Nxf6+ forking the rook and king.  However, from this point on it's noticeable that almost every move white does is forced by black.} Nd4 {Take my post on d4 to allow my queen to defend the f pawn. Although right after I make my move I realize my c pawn is free for the taking if he so chooses, but...} 17. Kh1 {17. Nxc5 Qg5! threatens mate as well as white's knight!  White gets his king out of the way.  I honestly didn't see the Qg5 possibility until reviewing the game so I was in panic mode to move to b6 and was pleasantly pleased at the time with white not taking my c pawn.} b6 18. g3 {Perhaps Bf3 might have been better?} Qh6 {This is why Bf3 would have been better and he is forced to respond in a defensive way to my move giving me more initiative and forcing white to move the h pawn.} 19. h4 Bb7 20. Bf3 Ke7 {Perhaps better would have been Nxf3 21. Qxf3 Ke7 22. Rae1 f5! winning the knight.  And while I kind of missed the timing it turns out for the better as despite being a knight up, the middle would be clogged and under white's control.  I liked Ke7 better to further my attack.} 21. Bg2 f5 22. Ng5 Bxg2+ 23. Kxg2 f6 24. Nf3 Nxf3 25. Qxf3 f4 {Everything was just about forced up to this point (with the exchanges and all).  Time to materialize those pawns. I didn't want to Qxh4 because of Rh1! and following that up with Rxh7+.} 26. Kh2 f5 {I'm looking forward to moving Rg4 by playing f5.  Obviously I see the threat of Qxa8 but I'm in no hurry and there isn't much white can do.} 27. Rae1 Rab8 28. Re5 {Waste of a move.  Re5 effectively seals off that rook from the king-side and doesn't present any real threat to any piece.} Rg4 29. Rg1 Rbg8 {Doubling up the rooks.  Qh5 was an alternative.  I really just didn't see me losing the game at this point.} 30. Rg2 Qh5 31. Kg1 Rxh4 {A little unfortunate as I realize I probably miss played and couldn't add to my advantage.  White now has the choice of whether he wants to go 2 rooks vs. a queen or exchange of the queens and a rook.} 32. Qxh5 {White chooses the latter of the two and we go into the endgame.} Rxh5 33. gxf4 Rxg2+ 34. Kxg2 Rh4 35. Kg3 Rg4+ 36. Kh2 {Sacrifices the pawn on f4 to prevent black's rook from moving to g1 threatening white's entire queen side.} Rxf4 37. Kg2 Kf6 38. Re3 Kg5 {Preventing white from boxing me out of the king side (denying Rg3) as white can't afford to exchange rooks.} 39. a3 a5 40. f3 Rh4 {Much better was Rd4 and regretted that move the moment I made it as Rh4 does nothing for black.} 41. Re1 Rd4 {See? It's still the best move for black even after wasting a move.} 42. Rd1 Kf4 43. Kf2 {Forced to move his king over to defend against Ke3!  This allows me to begin the pawn exchanges in the middle to give me some moving room.} e5 44. Ke2 e4 45. fxe4 fxe4 46. Rf1+ {White doesn't want to exchange his rook.  Smart play.} Ke5 47. dxe4 Rxe4+ {Kxe4 is just flat out awful as it allows white to grab the h7 pawn.  This forces white to move his king to d3 (to prevent black from moving Kd4!)} 48. Kd3 h5 {Let the advancement begin!} 49. Rf8 Rd4+ {Can't afford to let white go Re8+! taking my rook for free.} 50. Kc3 Rf4 {Ke4 is not better as the h pawn will fall to white's Rh8.} 51. Rb8 {Pretty obvious moves from white but even he should know that rook is going to be forced to fall to the h pawn.} Rf3+ 52. Kc2 h4 53. Rxb6 d6 {Some cute positioning moves.} 54. Rb8 h3 {I think Kd4 could also send black to a Rook-2pawn vs. 3pawn endgame.} 55. Rh8 Kd4 {Now it's time for black to ensure the rook-pawn exchange.} 56. Rh4+ {Really, what else can white do? If white moves a4 black follows with Rf2+! 57. Kd1 h2 with black promoting and white exchanging.  Either way, the game really seems over at this point.} Ke3 57. b4 cxb4 58. axb4 axb4 59. Kb3 {Trying to get his c pawn to promote, not a bad idea but white is out of time.} Kf2+ 60. Kxb4 Kg2 61. Rh6 h2 {Forcing white to take h2 otherwise it will promote.} 62. Rxd6 {Chooses to go Rook-pawn vs. Queen-Rook.} h1=Q 63. c5 {This is mate in 5 for black.} Qb1+ 64. Kc4 Qb3+ 65. Kd4 Rf4+ 66. Ke5 Qe3+ 67. Kd5 Qe4# {gg.  Arguably the best game I've played to date.  A couple minor move errors but due to piece positioning white couldn't overcome being down that one pawn and was constantly playing defense the whole game.  Both games we played were very well played, splitting the series as each won as black.}
