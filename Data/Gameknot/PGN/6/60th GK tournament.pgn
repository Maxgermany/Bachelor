1. e4 {Just a game i thought i would add to the annotations as an example of removing the defender.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Both knights threaten to capture central pawns.} 3. Bc4 Bd6 {Development is a better option as you should never violate the golden rule " never move the same piece twice in the opening"} 4. d3 {Trying to open up some space for my bishop to pin the knight.} Nc6 5. Bg5 {Done.} a6 6. a3 {To prevent Bd4+} h6 {Black trying to expell the bishop.  I dont want to run around so the exchange was accepted.  Also gets the black queen out early which is potentially good for white as you will see in a few more moves.} 7. Bxf6 Qxf6 8. Nc3 Nd4 {Black trying to threaten Nxc2 or Nxf3 and if white Qxf3 then Black Qxf3 white will have to recapture with gxf3 leaving white king exposed. } 9. Nxd4 {accept the exchange works out better for white.} exd4 10. Nd5 {Lets push the queen shall we.} Qg6 11. Qf3 {Looking to threaten the potentially weak f7 pawn and force black to castle kingside} O-O {black takes the bait and the plan is in play.  Now to remove the defender of the e7 square and set up a fork.} 12. e5 Bxe5 {Black grabs the bait twice in a row and its all over.} 13. Ne7+ {Black resigns.}
