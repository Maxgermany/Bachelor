1. e4 {...this is one of those games that shows a willingness to give up material for development..part of the learning process and on this occasion it worked out ...but its not always the case... I took an offbeat approach to the Sicilian and I am getting a lot of interesting positions with it...} c5 2. Na3 {What the ..? Yes...Na3 is a slightly differing way to stick it to the book worm early..} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 {..pure development in mind...both bishops are loose ...} e6 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. c4 {..white is ahead on development but grabbing space..} Ndb4 7. d5 {..aiming for d6 clamp on the dark bishop..or open up the centre owing to development advantage} Nd4 8. Nxd4 cxd4 9. d6 f6 10. f4 {..trying to support d6..here black gets the run of things with the queen but...} a6 11. Nc2 Nxc2+ 12. Qxc2 fxe5 13. fxe5 Qa5+ 14. Bd2 Qxe5+ 15. Be2 Bxd6 16. Rf1 {..blacks king is stuck in the centre..he is 2 pieces down in development...} Qxh2 {..3 pawns up..? Should white panic...?  } 17. c5 Qh4+ 18. Kd1 Be7 {..not yet..Ra8 and Bc8 are asleep and need 2-3 moves to have any influence..Rh8 can only challenge Rf1} 19. Qc4 {centralise her majesty...} Rf8 20. Kc2 {...RxR favours white} Rxf1 21. Rxf1 Qe4+ 22. Bd3 {..I think black should look at maybe 21..b5 22 cb Rb8 to get some counter play} Qxg2 {..4 pawns up..?!} 23. Qxd4 {..ok 3...} Bf6 {..so whites king is in the middle..I have a strong pawn on c5...and 2 dangerous bishops...ok..what to do..} 24. Rxf6 gxf6 25. Qxf6 {..an exchange and pawns down...gone mad?  Nope..Blacks only active piece is the queen..} d6 26. Qh8+ {..her majesty goes in for some fun} Kd7 27. Qxh7+ {..3 pawns now..} Kd8 28. Be4 {..wait a minute ...oh look black is in trouble if I get to play cxd6...where does the queen go...?} Qf2 29. cxd6 Qc5+ 30. Kb1 {...wait a second..black is lost..he cant take the pawn..the bishops will pick up the queen by force or mate..eg 30..Qxd6 31. Bg5+ 32.Bg6+ 33. Bh6#} Qg1+ 31. Bc1 {..black has to give up the queen to stay in the game ! My opponent send a message mocking his queenside development...  So on this occassion is shows that giving up material for development worked..but I think you need to ensure the tempii you gain is sufficient to seriously wound the opponents position....}
