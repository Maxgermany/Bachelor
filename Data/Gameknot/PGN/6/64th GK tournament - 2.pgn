[Opening "Petrov's defence (C42)"]

1. e4 {Nothing special here. e4: the most common opening for white. } e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov's defense. Not too many people understand this opening, but I have used it on several occasions, and see scenarios where it works and situations where it doesn't. One thing I am confused, do most games end up in a draw with this opening or is there an advantage to one color and why?} 3. Qe2 {? - Not the response I was expecting. It traps the bishop and seems to hinder development just to protect the center e4 pawn.} d6 {My general response to the protection of e4. In this case, my c8 bishop is free to roam and attack or defend white. I know black bishop is cut off, but I usually don't mind this, as the game usually develops into a situation in which this bishop becomes very useful.} 4. d4 {?! - Seems like a move late, but still serves the purpose of attacking the center. Seems this would be more powerful at 3. d4!?} Be7 {Simple. I am just doing textbook strategy. The white bishop is still not developed so it seems as if I am ahead. Wonder if I castle too early or is the main goal here to get the king into a protected position by castling this early? Any feedback here would be appreciated.} 5. h3 {Blocks 5. ... Bg4, but development of the c2-bishop is still quite bad.} O-O 6. Bg5 {? - Is it just a manner of trading off the knights or is this person looking at something else?} Nbd7 {Because I don't want to trade here right away. I want white to play aggressively. It benefits me. I can set up successful counters without much retribution from white. (Even though I do block in my queen.)} 7. c4 {? - Transposing to a three pawn attack? Break my chain? Not exactly what I expected white to do, although it is a pretty aggressive approach. Let's see where it leads...} Nxe4 {! - Took my chance to play aggressive, since I see myself winning this exchange and taking advantage of the under-developed position white is in.} 8. Qxe4 Bxg5 9. dxe5 {White is fighting to hold the center. But I don't think there is enough here for white to hold on to. Being the strategist here, I let white decide which combinations he will approach me with.} Nxe5 10. Nxe5 {?? - I seriously think the bishop was a better option. Or better yet, why trade when down a pawn? Perhaps Nbd2(?) was a better option? Or even Be2, giving white king a protection route to castle. } dxe5 {! - Confirming my grasp on the central position. Both bishop is protected and pawn can't be taken. Removing the knights really opened the board, which can be good or bad for black.} 11. Nd2 {?? - FATAL miscalculation. Perhaps thinking of queen-side castle to try and regain central position? White is way too open to even think of trying this. 11. Bd3 to allow the king to reenter a closed protected area by castling kingside. This BAD miscalculation costs black dearly.} Qxd2# {}
