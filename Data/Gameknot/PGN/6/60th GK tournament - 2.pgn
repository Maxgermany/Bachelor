1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. h3 {I really thought this was going to be a sicilian by the books until this move.} g6 {Didn't know what else to do so I continued with the dragon sicilian setup.} 5. a3 {Another strange move. Somebody help me out with this one.} Bg7 6. Bc4 {What I think is interesting is he has developed his pieces much faster at the expense of virtually no pawn development.} O-O 7. Ng5 {I despise this move because the threat is always there and I do not like moving my pawns to chase the knight away. Also, there is 2 pieces to attack f7 pawn (right in line with my king).} Nbd7 8. d4 {That move is textbook sicilian if it was played on move number 3. I wondered if it would be possible to transition into a more normal sicilian game at this point. But there was no knight to take the pawn.} cxd4 9. Qxd4 Ne5 {Still sticking with sicilian dragon defense.} 10. Bf4 Nxc4 {To take away one threat on f7. } 11. Qxc4 Bd7 12. Bh2 a6 13. b4 Rc8 {I think by this point, the importance of a good pawn structure is evident.} 14. Qb3 Rxc3 15. Qa2 h6 16. Nxf7 Rxf7 17. g4 Nxe4 18. f3 Rcxf3 19. O-O-O Nc3 20. Qc4 Bb5 21. Qb3 Ne2+ 22. Kd2 Bc3+ 23. Qxc3 Rxc3 24. Rhe1 Rxh3 25. Reh1 e6 26. Rde1 Qg5+ {}
