[Opening "King's knight's gambit (C34)"]

1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 {Here playing white on a King's knight gambit. It's a blitz game 5min+15.} Nc6 {Well, me too I like to open with this knight. Fischer said d6 was the best continuation, giving the oportunity to pin quickly the knight with Bg4.} 4. Bc4 h6 {Thinking about to follow with g5, protecting the f pawn and threatening the king. I still prefer to do directly g5. When playing the king gambit, the tempo is so much important.} 5. O-O d6 6. d4 a6 {Thinking to move out my bishop, but by doing so he is losing tempo.} 7. Bxf4 {Getting back my pawn.} Nge7 8. e5 {Well I was thinking about a way to move away my knight or my bishop to attack f7. If black exchange it will give me this oportunity + it will give me space on the e line.} d5 {Well done.} 9. Be2 {Getting away of the knight's reach.} Be6 10. Nbd2 {Thinking about to continue with c4.} Nf5 11. Nb3 {I like going to b3 with my knight it give most of the times some nice places to go.} Qd7 12. Nc5 {? Well played too quickly here and forgot about the bishop. Rc1 would have been better I think. } Bxc5 13. dxc5 {Now Black got a passed pawn on the center and some of my pawns are pretty weak now.} O-O-O 14. b4 {? Well the knight just need to take it.} d4 15. b5 axb5 16. Bxb5 Ne3 {Threatening my queen and my rook, no choice to take it.} 17. Bxe3 dxe3 18. Qe2 {Qxd7, Rxd7, Bxc6, bxc6 would have gave me a nice position. But I didn't like that e pawn. Black was doing fine at this point.} Bd5 19. Ba6 {!! This side of the field is completly unprotected and the b line is freed. I don't think there's a way for black to escape the mate at this point.  If bxa6, then Qxa6+ followed by Rb1#} Bxf3 20. Bxb7+ Kxb7 {If Kb8, then Qa6 then Qa8#.} 21. Rab1+ Ka7 22. Qb5 {There's no way out.} Rdb8 23. Qa4+ Na5 24. Qxa5# {Well it was a good game.}
