1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {[B76] Reflections on a game from a dragon thematic tournament } 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O a6 {...a6 in the Yugoslav attack is generally a tempo loss and should be avoided unless there is a specific plan. White was not threatening to go to b5. Better are the main lines 9...d5, 9...Bd7 and 9...Nxd4 10.Bxd4 Be6. (look up some grandmaster games to understand the different ideas behind one of these lines).} 10. Kb1 {There is no immediate refutation of ...a6 although white might win a race to checkmate on the h-file. 10.h4 and 10.g4 are playable but I don't know exactly which is better. White should not play 10.Bc4 here because then 10...Nxd4 11.Bxd4 b5 would justify black's ...a6 move. 10. Kb1 is a useful waiting move, which prevents ...Qa5 due to the following trick played in the game. I thought White can take the time to play this due to black's slow move ...a6, and was planning on choosing between h4 and g4 next move.} Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Qa5 {?? This is not playable with the white king on b1. It was still possible to transpose to the 9...Nxd4 line with 11...Be6 followed by 12...Qc7, 13...Rfc8 and only then 14...Qa5. Although 9...a6 is going to be a harmful loss of tempo.} 12. Nd5 Qxd2 {This is not check!} 13. Nxe7+ Kh8 14. Rxd2 Be6 15. Bxf6 {I was trying to get my knight back to d5. In retrospect 15.Nd5 is probably better. I will have to recapture on d5 with a pawn, but will avoid opposite color bishop endings.} Bxf6 16. Nd5 Bxd5 17. Rxd5 Rfd8 18. Bd3 {?! Obviously it was time to move the bishop, but where? I was uncomfortable with Bc4 because of ...b5 and ...a5. Bd3 prevents ...f5 Be2 gets out of the way of the rooks, but is a passive square. g3/Bh3 is another plan. My bishop and h1-rook are worse than their counterparts, but if I can get the black pieces tied down to the defense of d6 then I can slowly improve white's position. } Rac8 19. Rd1 Rc5 {! One step closer to reach the opposite color bishop ending.} 20. Bf1 Rxd5 21. Rxd5 Be5 22. g3 g5 {!} 23. c3 {I couldn't figure out exactly what to do and was drifting around a bit.} Kg7 24. Kc2 Rc8 25. Bh3 {setting a trap, which black doesn't fall into right now, but...} Rc6 26. Bd7 Rc7 27. Bf5 h5 28. Kd1 {?!} Rc5 {?? This is the losing move, and the trap. I was afraid black could draw this position by: (a) playing ...b6. This will allow the a-pawn to advance to a5 if attacked by the bishop. Note white can't prevent ...a5 with b4 because c3 hangs, and if white plays a4 threatening a5 then black has time to play ...a5 first. (b) moving king to d8 or c7 (close enough to defend d6 and b6 pawns, and trying to stop a passed pawn in case of a ...b6; a4 a5; b4 axb4 cxb4 sequence (assuming the c3 pawn has to be well protected by white first- this means white's king and rook are passive) (c) only then trying to exchange rooks} 29. Rxc5 dxc5 30. Bc8 {With 2 extra pawns, the opposite color bishop ending is now won for white. The plan is to make passed pawns on opposite wings, as far apart as possible. Just because it's (theoretically) won does not mean it's resignable; the game HAS to be played out. One slip by white and it's drawn again. Black just has to suffer and patiently wait for a chance.} b6 31. Bxa6 h4 32. gxh4 Bxh2 33. hxg5 Bf4 34. Ke2 Bxg5 35. Kd3 Bc1 36. b3 Kg6 37. Kc4 Bb2 38. Bc8 Kf6 39. a4 Ke5 40. Kb5 Bxc3 41. Kxb6 Bd4 42. Kb5 Kd6 43. Kc4 Be3 44. b4 cxb4 45. Kxb4 Kc7 46. Bh3 Kb6 47. Bf1 Bc5+ 48. Kc4 Be3 49. Kd5 f6 50. Ke6 Bd4 51. f4 Kc7 52. e5 fxe5 53. f5 Kd8 54. f6 Ke8 55. a5 Kf8 56. Bd3 Ke8 57. a6 Ba7 {}
