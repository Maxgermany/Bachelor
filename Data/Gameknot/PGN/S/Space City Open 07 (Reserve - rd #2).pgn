1. Nf3 {As the second round of the Space City Open begins, I find myself looking at the wall chart and being traumatized when I see the last name of my next opponent. I am feeling fat and bloated from my pig out experience at Cracker Barrel, and the last thing in the world I want is to play this kid. He is 10, and definitely on his way up the ratings chart. Then I look a little closer, and realize that it's not the wunderkind, but his father that I am playing. Matt is the VP of the Alabama Chess Federation and a very cool guy, but he is a beginner who only really got into competetive play because of his kid. As is typical in a Swiss tourney, I go from playing the highest rated player in round one to the lowest rated player in round two. I open with 1. Nf3.} Nf6 {An interesting choice for a beginner. Let's see if he can handle a transposition.} 2. d4 {I see an opportunity to get into my pet QG lines (which constitute 80 % of my rated games with the white pieces). } d5 3. c4 {I put my mind into full Queens gambit mode. I feel secure whether he takes or not.} e6 {! I'm gonna give Matt full credit here for not being enticed by the apparent low hanging fruit. Most beginners snap off the c pawn quick. Black opts for a traditional QGD line.} 4. cxd5 {I feel confident in saying that I play this move 100% of the time. The exchange variation of the QGD is my all time favorite. At this point, I intend to play Rc1 as soon as possible and start raising Cain on the c file.} exd5 {Regaining equality.} 5. Nc3 Bb4 {Black develops nicely, and prepares to castle. Honestly, I expected Nc6......} 6. Bg5 {I seriously considered Qa4 , which I normally play against weaker players. But I realized that black has not been intimidated by me at all so far, and God forbid, may actually have some game. I reigned in my ego and played a logical developing move which established a nice pin.} Nc6 {Not bad, but not great IMHO. Bf5 seems to hold more promise.} 7. e3 Bg4 {Black keeps chugging right along, and makes another good move. I remind myself that over-confidence has taken down players far better than I, and that I should now double my efforts and start playing chess. No one is gonna just give me a point.} 8. h3 {!? I set the first trap. If he takes, I'll retake with my queen and have possibilities on f6. I know that developing my LSB is more logical, but I just had the feeling that my opponent was having problems keeping up with the consequences of the three pins on the board. His eyes and body language told me that he wanted to keep things as simple as possible, so I put him to the test.} Bxf3 {?! My gut feeling turned out to be right. Black tries to maintain some degree of tempo, but in the process allows me my wish.} 9. Qxf3 Qd7 {? Obviously annoyed by the pin against his queen, black blunders a pawn - and in the process wrecks his kingside pawns.} 10. Bxf6 gxf6 11. Qxf6 {I breathe a little easier now, and realize that I'm a pawn up with superior pawn structure. I now intend to trade off everything in sight and get into a won endgame.} Rg8 {Protecting his hanging rook and getting it to an open file.} 12. Bd3 {Daring black to play Rxg2, as I'll respond Qh8  winning a rook.} Qe7 {? Black assists me in my liquidation plans. Why trade queens here? The ladies promptly come off the board.} 13. Qxe7+ Nxe7 14. O-O {Getting to safety and protecting my g pawn.} h5 {This little fella was hanging anyway, so black pushes him into action.} 15. a3 {Please take, please take, please take............} Bd6 {Black wisely refuses, but moves his DSB to a vulnerable square. } 16. Nb5 {I now see doubled d pawns on the horizon.} a6 {?! 16...Rd8 17. Nxa7 c6 drops a pawn, but makes my knight vulnerable.} 17. Nxd6+ cxd6 18. Rac1 {Ok, things are looking good. I'm a pawn up, his six pawns are on four islands, and I have a juicy open file to work with. Time to clean house.} Kd7 {Connecting his rooks and keeping me out of c7.} 19. Rc2 {Preparing to double up while latently protecting g2 should he get any ideas of doubling down the g file.} Rg7 {Which he does.} 20. Rfc1 Nc6 {Trying to squash my ideas of play down the c file, but severely limiting this piece.} 21. b4 {I'm fully prepared to drop my a pawn if need be to harrass his knight. } Rag8 {Hitting g2 twice.} 22. Bf5+ {No need to panic about g2 just yet. ...let's get his king moving.} Ke7 23. f3 {g2 is now protected.} Kf6 {Black understands that the king is also a weapon, but moving it in front of its protection is not wise.} 24. g4 {As we both hit g4 three times, I felt comfortable making this aggressive move. The pin will have to be broken however.} Ne7 {! Removing one of the g4 protectors.} 25. Bd3 {I gasp in horror when I see that I'm about to return the pawn with check tempo for black. } Nf5 {?? 25...hxg 26. fxg Rxg  was the correct play. This was an outright blunder. I felt like the convict who was already strapped to the chair when the Governor calls at 11:59 pm.} 26. Bxf5 hxg4 {My good friend Matt just shook his head when he realized that I knew that I had dodged a bullet. With a chuckle to himself he rids himself of a pawn island.} 27. hxg4 Rh8 {As the g file is now a dead end, black moves over to the h file and hopes for action down it.} 28. Rh2 {Of course I can't allow him to double on the h file, so I offer up an exchange.} Re8 {Which he wisely declines by threatening my e pawn.} 29. Rc7 {?! I probably should have played Rce1 here, but felt that I could withstand the pressure should he take on e. } Kg5 {?! Rxe and black can at least establish some threats.} 30. f4+ Kf6 {Forced.} 31. Rh6+ {Ok, I've had enough of this. Time to get some pieces off of the board.} Rg6 {Forced yet again.} 32. Bxg6 fxg6 33. g5+ Kf5 34. Rf7+ {Looking for a way to put black out of my misery.} Kg4 {?! I expected Ke6 which may have prolonged the game as black could attempt to manuever behind his remaing pawns. } 35. Rxg6 {His g pawn was like an annoying speed bump, so I opt to remove it and just deal with his take on e3.} Rxe3 36. Kf2 {Just to be safe and get off of the edge. He still has mating material available to him.} Rxa3 37. Re6 {Bringing a defender back into action, and ensuring g pawn promotion.} Ra2+ 38. Re2 Ra3 39. g6 {Only now do I feel confident that the win is assured. I can safely defend all threats and black is gonna be hard pressed to deal with my passer.} Rf3+ 40. Ke1 Kh5 {Sorry Matt, you're not gonna catch him.} 41. g7 Rg3 {A last gasp effort to stop my promotion.} 42. Rh2+ {I get a nice little tactic to finish him off.} Kg4 43. g8=Q+ Kf3 44. Rf2+ {Wins his last offensive threat and wins the game.} Ke3 45. Qxg3+ {....and black resigned. We both had a good laugh at how reckless my 24. g4 was (I think he laughed harder than I did:) While obviously happy with the full point, I was somewhat disappointed with my game. I really should have put this one away far sooner I felt. I tell myself not to dwell on it, and start poring over the wall chart once again to see how things are shaping up. The field is 14 players large, and I'm #6 on the ratings list. I still have three tough games to go if I want to cash in this tourney. I really shouldn't be thinking about the margaritas I'll be drinking later tonight, but I'm really craving some alcohol induced relaxation. I pace nervously and smoke cigarettes waiting for round three.......}
