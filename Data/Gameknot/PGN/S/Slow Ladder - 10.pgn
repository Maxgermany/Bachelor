1. e4 {He opens with e4.} e5 {I answer e5} 2. Bc4 {he answers withBf1-c4} Bc5 {I answer with Bf8-c5.Is that not pretty i have"matched" each of his moves with same move.Can you see it?Don't worry if you cannot. I totally missed it to.Ke8 is very much in danger now.} 3. Qf3 {Qd1-f3 for white this is pivotal moment and where i lost the game,i should have been watching whole board.But no i was concentrating developing center.IF ONLY IF i had seen Qf3 i would have moved Ng8-f6 or even moved Qd8-e7 most likely i would have went with Ng8-f6.Basically my king is sitting there unprotected waiting to get killed!} d6 {VERY wrong move d7-d6.King is doomed} 4. Qxf7# {Qfe-f7# King is iced}
