1. e4 {Scandinava classica, interessante. Posizione per un sacrificio ma... non l'ho saputo portare avanti!!! My usual scandinavian - Lasker line, with a goog glance of danger for white. } d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. O-O Bf5 7. d4 e6 8. Ne5 Nd7 9. Bf4 Bd6 10. Bg4 {Till here everything's as in the "book" (well, "my" book). Now, the interesting idea I want to submit is o-o-o, exposing black to Nxf7, winning a rook for a knight but, in the last term, for two minor pieces, since the knight cannot escape and black will take the bishop in f4, threatening to go on with Bxh2 .  The question is: is this move playable for black? Taking into account that white can answer, for instance, BxBf5 and then leaving a lot of possibilities for black, but all leading to a weak e column.  This is the reason for I didn't play it, but still I wonder...} Ne7 {Best answer for white, probably, is 11. BxB, and after NxB... maybe 12. Ne4, or 12. g4!?} 11. Re1 O-O-O {I couldn't resist, but probably it would have been better before.} 12. Nxf7 {It loses two minor pieces for a rook, so it is good for black. But I wanted to go further.} Bxf4 13. g3 Nf6 {The sacrifice. Is Bd6 better? This is an important question, seeing the rest of the game. } 14. Bxf5 Nxf5 15. Nxd8 Rxd8 {Now, the rook will press on the d column, and after white takes the bishop, I saw a lot of danger for white. } 16. gxf4 {He accepted the sacrifice, probably he analyzed it very well. I always trust on my aggressive play, but not always it works...} Qxf4 {A quality under, but... what an attack!} 17. Ne2 Qg4+ {If Kf1, Qh3  with more or less the same result, but one move quicker! } 18. Ng3 Qh3 {First threat of a mate threat: Ng5.  If 19. f3, Nxg3, 20. h2xg3, Qxg3 , 21. Kf1, Ng4! (22. fxN, Rf8  and mate, and if 22. Qe2 or Qd2, Nh2  forcing white to lose the queen, and if 22. Re2, Qh1 , 23. Kd2 and Rxd4  wins the queen)! So he played...} 19. Nxf5 {It doesn't matter, my friend... :-)} Ng4 {Mate threat, as promised :-) } 20. Qd2 {If 20. Re2, it's mate in 2.} Qxh2+ 21. Kf1 {Now, my blindness. I didnt' considered 21. ..., Rf8.  Now, he can save the knight, winning a second piece. Say 22. Ng3. But then I can take Rxf2, and mate. And if he protects f2 with 23. Re2, Qh1#.   And if 22. Ne7 , I simply play Kd7, while 22. f3 loses the queen.  It appears as if, even if white has a move, he can't use it to save the game.   The only choice seems to be 22. Ke2, since after Qxf2 , 23. Kd1, QxQ, 24.QxQ, e6xf5, and despite the quality, black pawns should win but the game is still playable.   But meybe black has an even better choice: after 22. Ke2, Nxf7... what? The threat is to win the white queen with the knight after the discovered check.  So let's take a look at the possible moves for white.  A) 23. Rh1 doesn't help after Nxh1 , and now white have to choose between  1) 24. Kd1, Qg1 , 25. Qe1, QxQ, 26. KxQ, and after RxN black wins, or 25. Ke2, and QxRa1 or even 25. ..., Qg4 , 26. Ke6, RxN and white cannot take the Nh1 because of Rf5 , Ke2 and Qg2 , winning the rook, or  2) 24. Kd6, Qh3 , and now white again have to choose between 25. Ne3, Nf2 , 26. Ke2, Qf3 , 27. Ke1, QxRa1, winning, or 25. Qe3, QxN , 26. Kd2, Qf2 , 27. QxQ, and black wins because can save the h1 knight both with RxQ or NxQ (28. Rf1, Rf6!).   Last chance for white: B) 23. Qb4, threatening the rook... but, while the simple RxN balances the material, Ne4  or Ng4  require more work (23. ..., Ng4 , 24. Kd3, RxN, 25. Rxe6, Rf3 , 26. Kc4, Ne3 , 27. RxN (Kc5, Rf5  and mate...).  I didn't see it. Did I lose the occasion to be a Morphy? :-))))))} Qh1+ 22. Ke2 Qe4+ 23. Ne3 Rxd4 24. Qc3 Nh2 {Second mate threat. But white is above 3 points...} 25. Reg1 Qf3+ 26. Ke1 Qe4 27. Rxg7 {Probably white doesn't see the perpetual trap... or he welcomed it!} Qh1+ 28. Ke2 Qf3+ 29. Ke1 Qh1+ 30. Ke2 Qf3+ 31. Ke1 Qh1+ {}
