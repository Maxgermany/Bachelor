1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. a3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 d6 {The starting position for all the games.} 6. Bg5 O-O 7. e4 Nbd7 {Having already castled, Black has a slight edge in time, but White has more space. Also, Black's QB will have a difficult time getting out.} 8. e5 dxe5 {White was too impatiient. He had a strong center but after advancing...} 9. dxe5 Nxe5 {...his center has dissipated and I'm up a Pawn as well.} 10. Qxd8 Rxd8 {With his doubled, isolated QBP's, White wants to inflact a weakness in my pawn structure as well to compensate. but exchanging the Q's helps me. With every piece that vanishes my advantage of a Pawn gets bigger.} 11. Bxf6 gxf6 {I complete the exchange. } 12. Rd1 Rxd1+ {I gladly swap Rooks. White is now significantly behind in time, as his entire K-side still must be developed.} 13. Kxd1 b6 {I want to fianchetto the B so I can occupy the open Q file with my Rook.} 14. Ne2 Nxc4 {I'll gladly acquire another loose Pawn.} 15. a4 Bb7 {White's B is still blocked in and is in turn blocking in the R.} 16. Kc2 Rd8 {I now look to swap down.} 17. Nd4 Ne5 {A tactical retreat to a safe base.} 18. f4 Nc6 {Looking to exchange the Knights.} 19. Nxc6 Bxc6 {White does it for me. How nice.} 20. Rg1 Kg7 {Time to activate the King.} 21. g3 Kg6 {Pushing forwards.} 22. Bd3+ f5 {The simplest solution.} 23. Re1 Bxa4+ {Grabbing another loose Pawn.} 24. Kd2 Bb5 {Exploiting the pin.} 25. Re3 Rxd3+ {After 26 RxR BxR 27 KxB K-B3, I have an easily won King-and-Pawn end game. So White resigns.}
