[Opening "Sicilian (B45), Taimanov variation"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {These moves were compulsory.} e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {As opposed to 4. …Nf6, which is more common.  Actually, the first four or five moves of the Sicilian are so malleable and interchangeable, each often leading to a known, studied line, that the order of these moves is secondary to the ideas.  This particular position is known as the Taimanov variation.  In this system, black often hopes to place a bishop on b4 or c5.  Many interesting and complex positions can be reached from this position, including a form of the Hedgehog, the Maroczy Bind, and the Kasparov gambit.} 5. Nc3 {A natural developing move, but with a latent threat.  What would love to, at some point, get a knight to d6, which is arguably the most powerful square that he can sit on.  The permanent weaknesses incurred at d5 and d6 for black have to be dealt with, and much time and effort has been spent finding the best methods for which he can do so.  One drawback of the Taimanov variation is by moving the e-pawn, black has created a permanent hole at d6.  White would do well to try to exploit it.  A knight on c3 is a mere two moves away from the lethal square, and of course, many other factors will have to be in place if the white player hopes to properly use the square to its devastating potential, but the lack of pawn protection leaves the idea permanently in both players minds.} d6 {Black creates a tight little pawn barrier in the center.  What it restricts in space, it adds to defense, and given the weakness at d6, it makes sense to occupy it with a pawn as second best to being defended by one. } 6. g4 {An aggressive move to be sure, but not completely debilitating.  The weaknesses incurred at f3 and especially f4 are believed to be not life threatening with proper play.  But, as we’ll see, Polgar was able to exploit the weakness.  If a player of Shirov’s strength is unable to defend the weaknesses, perhaps the move itself should be considered suspect.  It hardly speaks well of the line if your only hope is that your opponent misplays.} a6 {An innocuous looking move, but with deep theory behind it.  An early a6 is a common theme in many lines of the Sicilian.  The b5 square is inherently weakened due to black’s first move and a6 seeks to both defend it, and prepare b7-b5, as this often makes white’s knights uncomfortable.  Black must be careful not to over extend here, but a7-a6 can hardly be considered doing so.  The prophylactic nature of the move, combined with its subtle power, make it a common choice at the Grandmaster level.   } 7. Be3 {Shirov brings out the bishop to its best square.  Bf4, aside from prohibiting an f2-f4 advance, gives black the opportunity to play e6-e5, forking the knight and bishop.  This also lends support to the d4 square, which is the weakness white must with for the entire game.} Nge7 {Polgar chooses the superior knight development move, instead of Nf6.  Nf6 is all well and good, it develops, it helps clear the way for a KS castle, and it attacks the g-pawn, but it allows the following line: [9.  Nxc6 bxc6 (now any hopes for b7-b5 are gone, and black’s pawn on a6 isn’t doing as stellar of a job as it was before) 10. g6! (and black is on her heels.  She loses a tempo, and good, central spots for her knights are quickly disappearing) 10. …Nd7 11. Qd2 a5 12. f4! (now white is exerting incredible pressure on the KS.  The f4 weakness has been successfully nullified, and the KS pawns are storming.  Perhaps this is what Shirov had in mind with his 6th move?  Oh, to be able to calculate like that over the board…)] .  Nge7 accomplishes nearly the same thing as Nf6, but without conceding a tempo when white plays g6.  Also, the move contests f5, which is going to be black’s key breakthrough.} 8. Nb3 {Shirov sees the impending b7-b5 break, and takes steps to limit the power of it.  Although one can argue that reacting to a move that hasn’t happened yet gives your opponent the upper hand, I don’t believe that is the case here.  Shirov probably reasons b7-b5 is going to happen regardless, so taking a turn to move the knight will also have to happen, and whether it happens on move 9 or move 10 is irrelevant.} b5 {The inevitable consequence of a6 in the Sicilian.  This move has yet to find an absolute refutation, and until it does, I’m sure black will keep using it as a potent weapon.} 9. f4 {Shirov thrusts forward and creates an intimidating looking pawn wall, but as is often the case with pawn moves, their committal nature comes back to haunt them.  The f4 thrust fatally weakened g4.  Now, rather than having a dominating pawn wall along e4-f4-g4, white has a debilitating weakness along the squares e3-f3-g3, and also the weakness extends to e4 and f4, which can no longer be defended by pawns.} Bb7 {Calmly and efficiently, Polgar applies additional pressure to the e4 square, in preparation for the onslaught.} 10. Qf3 {As if he senses the impending break, Shirov sends his queen in to defend all three pawns.  The fact that this is necessary goes to show how weak these squares have become.} g5 {Most annotations give this a double exclamation point, even by grandmasters who are reluctant to do so.  Polgar sacrifices a pawn, but in return she nullifies the strongest point in white’s position.   The queen, who had been shielded behind the pawn wall is now uncomfortably open.  White is now forced to put his attacking plans on hold as he cleans up the mess that has ensued.} 11. fxg5 {Shirov has little choice but to accept the sacrifice as after 12 f5 Ne5, black has permanent control of f4 and e5.  The counter-attacking 12. e5 is a slightly more edible, but still leaves the ugly holes across d4, e4, and f4, as well as an isolated e-pawn after the captures.  Shirov’s best chance was to ignore the threat with O-O-O, and start a more strategic counter attack, putting pressure on the e-file.  It would be hard to do so when so much time and material are invested on the KS, to simply ignore it.} Nf5 {The knight gladly accepts the square left unguarded by the pawn capture} 12. Qg2 {The queen is now purely on defensive duties, and Shirov puts her on the square where she can guard both the e- and d- pawns.  Shirov is undoubtedly shaken at this point, much like Ivan Drago was when Rocky first cut him.} b4 {Polgar has seen deeply into this position and deems it necessary to constrict Shirov’s position even more.  On the surface, it may seem like it takes time out of her attack for a seemingly pointless move.  The knight can easily be moved, and most of the energy has been focused on the KS at this point, but it’s where the knight has to move to that Polgar is interested in.} 13. Ne2 {Shirov is forced to move the knight, and feels that it’s better to add to the defenders on the KS.  Na4 gets the knight out of danger, but a4 is a wretched square for him.  Nb1 is not as bad, but it cuts the rook off from the fight.  The drawback of Ne2 is that it constricts the king, as we’ll see in a few moves} h5 {Polgar finishes the combo with a right cross.  This removes the only defender of the f5 square (the pawn on e4 is pinned by the bishop).  The knight on e2’s restrictment of the king is becoming palpable} 14. gxh5 {Unattractive is gxf6 because after Bxf6, black’s bishop is joining the fray.} Ne5 {Polgar sends her other knight into the donnybrook.  They are nearly untouchable as white’s g- and h-pawns are too far advanced, and the e-pawn is pinned.  Overall, this is a very uncomfortable position for Shirov.} 15. Bf2 {This is almost forced as the bishop is undefended.} Qxg5 {Polgar brings out the big guns to add to the already lethal pressure in the KS.} 16. Na5 {This is the move that essentially loses for white.  The logic behind it is straightforward, to drive the bishop from the a8-h1 diagonal, but Shirov has over looked a devastating move at black’s disposal. } Ne3 {In his book “Chess: The Art of Logical Thinking,” Neil McDonald says that a mating attack with two knights is so rare in grandmaster play that it’s excusable that Shirov missed this move.  The queen is untouchable because of 17. Qxg5 Nf3#.   This type of mate is virtually never seen, so it's quite impressive that Polgar was able to create one.  Also, the knight attacks f2, and it will fork the king and rook if it gets there.  For Shirov, it's a case of losing his queen, his rook, or being mated.  Not a comfortable position for anyone to be in.} 17. Qg3 {Seeking to minimize the damage.  Shirov forks both knights, but the threat is completely benign.} Qxg3 {Polgar decides that the queens are not needed and she is happy to remove white's most powerful piece.} 18. Nxg3 {Capturing with the bishop leads to the horrific 18 ...Bxe4 19 Kf2 N3g4+ 20 Ke1 Bxh1, and recapturing with the h-pawn let's black mate on the next move with Nf3#.  The knight clears space for the king as well.} Nxc2+ {Polgar succeeds in pulling off a trick amateurs often fall for.} 19. Kd1 {Seeking to trap the knight after it takes the rook, but Polgar has a plan for that too!} Nxa1 20. Nxb7 {Shirov is finally able to dispose of the fire-breathing bishop.} b3 {Polgar succeeds in saving her knight, and will come out of this comfortably up the exchange.} 21. axb3 Nxb3 22. Kc2 {If he can't capture the knight, he might as well chase it off, and activate his king.  The Shirov is no doubt dreading the endgame that will follow, but he's prepared to go down with a fight.} Nc5 {Another option here was 22 ...Ng4 and after [23 Bg1 Nc5 24 Nxc5 dxc5 [24 ...Rc8? (25 Bxa6 Rc7 26 Bb4+, and white has successfully equalized] 25 Be2 Rg8!, black has a strong attack on the KS.  Alternatively, if 23 Bb6 Nc5 24 Nxc5 dxc5, black has a dangerous, albeit isolated, passed pawn, but it has the support of the knight on g4 (after Ne5), the rook on a8 (after Rc8), and the bishop on f8.]  The position reached in the game is nearly identical, only with the white bishop on f2 instead of b6} 23. Nxc5 {The other option was to take with the bishop, but Shirov correctly decides that keeping the bishop pair is one of the few advantages he has in this position.} dxc5 24. Be1 {Shirov looks to get his bishop to c3, pinning the knight to the rook.} Nf3 {Before allowing that to happen, Polgar removes the knight before he becomes tied down.} 25. Bc3 Nd4+ {A nifty little maneuver by Polgar, blocking the rook, but now it can no longer be taken because it is defended.} 26. Kd3 {Inadvisable was 26 Bxd4 because of 26 ...cxd4!, and the value of the passed pawn increased by being off the c-file.} Bd6 {It took until move 26 for Polgar to bring her last minor piece out, but when your opponent gives you the opportunity to use your knights in such an effective manner as Shirov allowed Polgar, it's forgivable.} 27. Bg2 {An excellent tactical idea.  28 e5! Will give black serious problems.  Fortunately for her though, Polgar found an adquate response.} Be5 {An excellent tactical idea.  28 e5! Will give black serious problems.  Fortunately for her though, Polgar found an adequate response.} 28. Kc4 {Following the adage of “restrain...blockade...destroy,” Shirov blocks the advance of the c-pawn.} Ke7 {Bringing her king into the fight and connecting rooks.  If one move gives you the opportunity to achieve two objectives, it might to well to make it.} 29. Ra1 {Shirov tries to tie the rook down to the defense of the a-pawn, and perhaps has ideas of Ra5.} Nc6 {White resigns here because [30 Kxc5 Rac8 31 Rxa6 Nb8+, and the rook is lost.]}
