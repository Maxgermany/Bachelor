1. d4 {Here's a fun, and I think instructive, example of attack and the initiative in the Slav.} d5 2. Nf3 c6 3. e3 {A little sketchy, but the game inevitably transposes. The weakness of e3 is not so much the blocking in of the c1 bishop (though it is often useful to develop this piece to g5 after ..Nf6 and ...e6), but its inflexibility. In a sense, it gives Black unnecessary information about White's setup. Even if White intends this move eventually, he shouldn't play it so early. Instead, he ought to retain flexibility by playing the obvious 3.c4, keeping his setup unclear and thereby restricting Black's options somewhat more.} Nf6 4. c4 {The game transposes to a Slav "Declined" Defense in the QGD. In this variation, Black plays an early ...Bf5, developing the c8 "problem" bishop outside of the pawn chain before solidifying with ...e6. } Bf5 {A fine move, developing the bishop actively before closing the pawn chain. It is worth noting, however, that Black's plan locks the bishop out of the queenside. White's modus operandi in this Slav variation is to exploit this with active play on the queenside. } 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nh4 {This patzer-looking move (attempting to trap Black's bad bishop) is actually a main idea for White. It turns out that Black's bad bishop is in fact quite active, hitting the b1/c2/d3 diagonal and greatly disrupting White's queenside plans. } Bg4 {This active move has fallen out of favor, as White's reply is disruptive, and g4 is not an ideal square for the Black bishop.  } 7. Qb3 b6 {Developing the queen in defense of b7, either with ...Qc7 or the simplifying ...Qb6, is much more common. The text weakens the c6 square, but it remains unclear how White can exploit this. } 8. h3 {Hunting the bishop. Even though Black's g4 piece isn't so annoying now, White still has the issue of the "dim" Nh4. The best solution is to force a trade....in doing so, White also gains the bishop pair. } Bh5 9. cxd5 {A necessary prelude to queenside play along the c-file. White can delay this move if he likes, but here he gives priority to developing the f1 bishop on the queenside (instead of the more common g4 and Bg2 plan). Alternative variation: [More direct is] 9. g4 Bg6 ([ perhaps even better is] 9... Ne4 [intending] 10. Nxe4 Qxh4 [with rough equality ]) 10. Nxg6 hxg6 11. Bg2 [when White retains a slight advantage] } cxd5 {This move is slightly worse than the two alternative captures. Given Black's unhappy state of development, it is probably not wise to create a fully open c-file, as White will likely seize it first. On the plus side, though, Black does liquidate his potentially weak c6 pawn. This is a fair accomplishment, of course, but the c6 square remains weak and now White attacks it directly. } 10. Bb5+ {An interesting idea. Again, more common is g4 followed by Nxg6 and Bg2, but White's plan is not typical. He will tie up Black on the queenside for as long as possible and play the advance g4 (with g5 if Black plays 10...Nbd7), intending to force the Black knights onto awkward squares and open up the game favorably. } Nbd7 11. g4 Bg6 12. g5 Ne4 13. Nxg6 hxg6 14. Nxe4 dxe4 15. d5 {The point of White's plan: 15.d5 opens up the board for White's 2 bishops, when Black's king is in an uneasy position and Black's f8 bishop does not have an easy time of development. Of course, just because White has accomplished his plan does not mean that Black is without resources, or that White's offbeat try is really a good idea in this position. As we will see, Black's position contains a latent energy that White cannot fully account for with his 2 developed pieces. } a6 {A solid reply. Black cannot develop safely without addressing the annoying pin against the d7 knight. Here, Black gains time in development should White continue the pin via Bc6 (something like Be2 is clearly a victory for Black, who can develop easily). Alternative variation: [Not] 15... Qxg5 16. dxe6 fxe6 17. Qxe6  [when White is winning.] Alternative variation: [ Keeping the center closed via] 15... e5 [is too dangerous, e.g.] 16. Qa4 Bd6 17. Bd2 [and Black's king is stuck defending the pinned knight while White has a free hand to mobilize in attack.] } 16. Bc6 {Alternative variation: [Much worse is] 16. Be2 Nc5 $1 [when White is thrown on the defensive.] Alternative variation: [Also bad is the liquidating] 16. dxe6 axb5 17. exd7  Qxd7 [as Black's pieces will now develop to active positions while White has a horrible-looking bishop on c1 and a very weak pawn on g5.] } Rc8 17. Qa4 {An interesting idea, initiating a double-attack on e4 and a6. Such moves are vital for White, as Black is slowly gaining the initiative on the queenside. } exd5 18. Bxd5 Qxg5 19. Qxe4+ Be7 {Material equality has been re-established, and Black's position looks a little better. His bishop is very active on e7, his knight has a great c5 outpost and a potential home on e4 that Black can fight for, the c8 rook owns the c-file, the g5 queen is quite active, and after ..0-0 Black's king is safe. White, meanwhile, has 2 bishops in an open position (as he intended), but his c1 bishop is quite bad (and hard to develop - b3 and Bb2 will be too slow, given ..Bf6) and his king must be content on e2. Since, given time, White can probably coordinate his pieces and sterilize Black's advantages, Black must play actively. } 20. Bd2 Rh4 {A very strong idea. After 20...0-0 the Black position is solid, but Black reasons that the h-file ought to be useful and his king looks reasonably safe on e8 (and after ..Kf8, he's even safer). Certainly this is a sharp continuation, as any Black slip will allow White direct counterplay against the stranded king, but after this move Black is very active and highly coordinated along the dark squares. This is significant, as White's bad bishop cannot help in defense along the dark squares, giving Black the clear upper hand. } 21. f4 {The only active reply, though a weakening one. The game is getting very sharp. } Qg3+ {This seemingly logical move is actually the key mistake for Black. The Black queen is offside on g6, while White's king reaches the light-squared safety of e2 and connects his rooks. Nevertheless, Black reasons that he can win the h3 pawn and thus "cashes out" his attack by grabbing a pawn. This is a common theme in attack - the attacker often must choose between grabbing material at the cost of the initiative or ignoring it and continuing to pressure his opponent (hoping to create even more weaknesses). In this case, White gains a powerful light-squared counterattack for the pawn...in other words, White has more than enough compensation. Alternative variation: [After the counter-attacking ...Nc5!?, both sides complete their development in earnest when Black has a solid position but must prove himself against the active White bishops.] 21... Nc5 22. Qc4 Qf6 23. Bc3 Qf5 24. Rd1 Kf8 Alternative variation: [The best try for Black is actually]  21... Qf5 [as a White exchange allows Black to contest the a1-h8 diagonal and gain a powerful outpost on e4. If White declines the queen trade, Black has an active queen and gains time.] 22. Qxf5 (22. Qf3 Qd3 23. Be4 Qb5 24. Bc3 Bb4) 22... gxf5 23. Bc3 Bf6 } 22. Ke2 Rxh3 23. Rxh3 Qxh3 24. Rh1 {Gaining time and exploiting the precarious position of the Black king. } Qg4+ 25. Kf2 {The best move. After the exchanges, White feels quite safe with his king on the dark square f2. The only lingering issue is a future ..Bh4  (impossible now due to the pin), which White must watch for. } Kd8 {Avoiding the pin and enabling...Bh4 , but via the wrong square! Of course 25... Kf8?? allows Rh8#, but ...Kd8 is too provocative, given the mobilization of White's pieces on the queenside. Now Black is subject to a fierce (and probably winning) attack. Alternative variation: [Much stronger is the counter-attacking] 25... Nc5 [when White has to balance his mating dreams with the frailty of his king after Rh8 :] 26. Bc6  Kd8 27. Rh8  Kc7 28. Rxc8  Qxc8 29. Qxe7  Kxc6 30. Qxf7 Qg4 [and the game will soon draw by perpetual, as both kings are wide open but not quite in danger (unless their queen goes pawn-grabbing, of course!)] } 26. Rh8+ Nf8 {The only move. after 26..Bf8?, White can activate his last passive piece via Bb4! with a deadly pin and mating motifs that force Black to shed material, e.g. Alternative variation: 26... Bf8 27. Bb4 Kc7 28. Bb7 [threatening Qc6  and mates] Qe6 29. Qxe6 fxe6 30. Bxc8 Bxb4 31. Bxd7 Kxd7 [ And White easily wins the ensuing endgame, owing to Black's isolated pawns.] } 27. Bb3 {The key move. White completely neutralizes ..Bh4  by covering the crucial d1 square and preventing the devastating...Qd1 . At the same time, he clears the d-file and the h1-a8 diagonal for the White queen, thereby enhancing Her Majesty's power. Alternative variation: [The one-move threat] 27. Qd4 [ allows the Black king to escape to the queenside.] Kc7 28. Bb4 Bxb4 29. Qxb4 Qd7 Alternative variation: [And standard developing moves allow Black to draw via ..Bh4 , e.g.:] 27. Bc3 Bh4  28. Kf1 Qd1  29. Kg2 Qg4  [ and White should probably take the draw via Kf1, instead of the risky:] 30. Kh1 Qh3  31. Kg1 Bf2  32. Kxf2 Qxh8 } Qf5 {Desperation, but there is nothing else. Of course if White exchanges queens he lets Black off the hook, but he is unlucky to do so in the midst of a winning attack! Alternative variation: 27... Bh4  28. Kf1 [ gets nowhere with d1 covered] } 28. Qb7 {An excellent square for the queen, threatening and gaining time with the attack on the b6 pawn. Alternative variation: [ Also playable is the materialistic] 28. Qd4  Kc7 29. Qc4  Kb7 30. Qxf7 Qxf7 31. Bxf7 [relying on active pieces and the 2 bishops for victory in the endgame. To me, however, this seems to be another case of cashing in the attack too soon!] } Qb5 {Forced. Black must defend b6 and a6 (and thus the weakening. ..b6 opening defense to Qb3 reveals its positional drawbacks. Of course it's perfectly playable, so long as Black's initiative doesn't peter out!) } 29. Bc3 {The gain of time created by White's last move allows this developing move, which fully mobilizes the White army. Inevitably, Black's queenside pawns will fall off the board (victims of the bishop pair, which has finally gained brutal side-by-side activity) and White will enter a winning endgame. Black's next move seeks to avoid this scenario, but (as he quickly realizes) it's not so easy! } Rxc3 {Sacrificing material to dull a dangerous attack is a common modern defensive procedure that Black is surely aware of, but here it simply doesn't work. There are far graver threats than the c3 bishop, and now Black's back rank is exposed and the f8 knight will inevitably drop. } 30. bxc3 {After this move, Black resigned. It seems he could not find any more useful moves! A great game. It is worth investigating how White's initial attack from the opening slowly petered out, allowing Black to seize the initiative with active piece play. When Black goes in for the sharp ...Rh5, he underestimates White's resources should he falter in attack, and ultimately succumbs to a case of "cashing in" his initiative for small material gain (a weak wing pawn), allowing White to grab the baton and ultimately create threats that Black could not answer. It may also be worth noting the nature of Black's material gain (the h3 wing pawn) - many modern authorities quite rightly consider wing pawns to be rather worthless in the middlegame, and some go as far as to claim that their owner would prefer them off the board, to activate his rooks. Certainly here White profited greatly in dynamic terms from losing his wing pawn, which cost Black time to capture and opened the crucial h-file for the White rook. Something worth thinking about - don't sell yourself short in attack! Anyway, hope you enjoyed this game - cheers! }
