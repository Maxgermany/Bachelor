1. e4 d5 {Part of my series of annotations explaining the Scandinavian Defence, 1.e4 d5} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 {3.. Qd6 and ..Qd8 are also possible. But this is the signature move. The classic books say "..Qa5 is bad as it allows white to chase the queen around and rapidly develop", but this is not the case if black plays accurately} 4. Qe2 {Unusual, but interesting. White wants to exchange off queens early to avoid complications. Black of course wants to keep queens.. so what's the solution for black? I can't find any games with my move, but here's another game to study, played in 1998. [White "Barbic, Zlatko"] [Black "Kroekel, Bernd"] [Result "0-1"] [BlackElo "2055"] 1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3.

Also looking at a tactical ..Nd4 later to exploit the queen postion} 5. Qb5 {"Let's exchange queens"} Qb4 6. Nd5 Qd6 {"Let's not"} 7. d4 {Loses. The simple Nc3 was better} a6 {Now its black's turn to chase the white queen around} 8. Qc5 Qd7 {A difficult move to find at the board, as it looks counterintuitive. Black's plan is ..e5 with strong pressure winning the d4 pawn, and with more open lines to make's white's life difficult. } 9. Ne3 {Look how the position has played out. Classical theory says in this line that black will pay for his early queen development, and white will finish his piece development early.. but in fact the opposite is true here. White has been a little too ambitious.} e5 {Very unpleasant for white. Where does the queen go?} 10. Qc4 exd4 11. Nd5 Bd6 {Planning to complete development with ..Nge7, ..O-O} 12. a3 {Too slow} Nge7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7+ 14. Qe2 {14. Be2 was better} Ne5 {Black is still happy to keep the queens on due to his advanced development. White still has too many pieces on their starting squares} 15. f4 Bg4 {Soon the queen will be lost} 16. Qe4 f5 {White resigns (17. Qd5 Nd3+ 18. Kd2 Qe3 mate)}
