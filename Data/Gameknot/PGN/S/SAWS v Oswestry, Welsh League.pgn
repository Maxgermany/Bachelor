1. e4 {This was played in the new "League Republic" https://cga.leaguerepublic.com/l/standingsForDate/342860268/2/-1/-1.html?fbclid=IwAR0yDq0jvhIcep-JXxufQA37GvKK3AB32T_JiaOTqHmC_ewYmKki2GO-2mQ} c5 {It was played on lichess https://lichess.org/iTTfOeZHRXP6} 2. d4 {Paul plays the Morra Gambit, unfortunately for him, I am half way through a theme based tournament on Lichess with this opening, so I have plenty of recent experience playing it with both white and black. https://gameknot.com/mt.pl?id=86018} cxd4 {I am also currently playing this game on chess.com featuring this opening. https://www.chess.com/game/daily/294461302} 3. c3 {So Paul offers the pawn. } dxc3 {I accept.} 4. Nxc3 {He takes back.} Nc6 {This is the normal move.} 5. Nf3 {And he develops this knight.} e6 {Blunting the Bf1, if it is developed to c4} 6. Bc4 {But it comes out anyway.} a6 {So I prepare b7-b5} 7. O-O {He castles.} Nge7 {This move has recently become more popular than the traditional Ng8-f6 where it can be hit by e4-e5} 8. Bg5 {He pins the bishop} f6 {I attack the bishop.} 9. Be3 {Bishop drops back.} b5 {I attack the other bishop.} 10. Bb3 {Bishop drops back.} Ng6 {My knight moves, allowing my Bf8 to develop. I was already quite happy with my position. I was interested to find out while doing this annotation, and being able to refer to an opening database, I see that on it, white has and interesting sacrificial continuation here - 11. Nd5!? The knight was accepted in Zakharov, Vladimir (2376) vs. Gusev, Aleksey (2383) and white won after 12.	exd5	Nce5 13.	d6	Bb7 14.	Nxe5	fxe5 15.	f4	exf4 16.	Re1	fxe3 17.	Rxe3+	Be7 18.

Nd4 {I was quite happy with this move, reasoning, "if you are going to move this knight to d4, why not play the main line of the Sicilian with 2. Nf3, 3. d2-d4 and 3. Nf3xNd4"} Bb7 {So I developed this bishop.} 12. Qh5 {Paul now plays an aggressive set-up, which comes close to over-whelming black.} Nxd4 {I try to reduce the attacking force with exchanges.} 13. Bxd4 {He takes back.} Bd6 {And this bishop finally comes out } 14. f4 {His attack continues. The first threat is 15. f4-f5 winning the pinned knight.} O-O {I castle to break the pin.} 15. f5 {Paul subjects this position to intensive analysis on his Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/paul.e.littlewood He says "I reached this position last night against my good friend Charles Higgie. Can Black risk Nf4 now...or should he simply play Ne5 and allow White to regain his lost material ?" The post initiated an interesting discussion.} Nf4 {This was my choice, attacking his queen and protecting e6.} 16. Qg4 {Threatening to take three times on e6.} Kh8 {My idea with this move was that now if he takes three times on e6, he doesn't finish up taking with check, so 17.	fxe6	dxe6 18.	Bxe6	Nxe6 19.	Qxe6	Bxh2+ 20.	Kxh2	Qxd4 and I am still a pawn up.  Also 7.	Rxf4	Bxf4 18.	Qxf4	e5 is a nasty fork winning material.} 17. Be3 {But Paul doesn't fall for any of those! I decide that the best form of defence is attack, even if it does mean giving back the extra pawn.} b4 18. Rad1 {He attacks my Bishop.} Qc7 {I defend.} 19. Bxf4 {The mass exchanges begin.} Bxf4 {I take back.} 20. Qxf4 {He takes back.} Qxf4 {I take his queen.} 21. Rxf4 {He takes back.} bxc3 {I take his knight.} 22. bxc3 {He takes back.} exf5 {I take here.} 23. exf5 {He takes back.} Bc6 {I protect my threatened pawn. } 24. Bd5 {And Paul offered a draw, which of course I was extremely glad to accept. Many thanks for reading.
