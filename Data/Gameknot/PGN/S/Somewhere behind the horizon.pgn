1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 Bf5 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 c5 {The Short variation of the Caro-Kann Defence. Blacks position is usually cramped but it has absolutely no weaknesses if you treat it right.} 6. Be3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Ne7 8. c4 Nbc6 9. Qa4 a6 {This is the state-of-the-art treatment of this branch. The great protagonist of this variation, Anatoly Karpov, lost a theoretically important game versus Boris Gelfand in their 1995 FIDE World Chess Championchip Candidates Match after 9. … dxc4 and gave up the Caro-Kann for the rest of this match. But since then the black knights strengthened their stonghold. :-)} 10. Na3 {A rare move also prefered by engines. 10. Nc3 ... is more common.} Qa5+ 11. Qxa5 Nxa5 12. O-O dxc4 13. Nxc4 Nxc4 14. Bxc4 Be4 15. Rac1 Bd5 16. Bg5 {I hadn't seen this move before, but in my opinion it's a strong move because black has to work hard to develop and even to castle. 16. ... Nc6? 17. Bxd5 exd5 18. Nxc6 bxc6 19. Rxc6 ...} Rc8 17. Bxd5 Rxc1 18. Bxb7 {Engines also consider my opponents choice to exchange his rook for a bishop and two pawns obviously aiming to push forward the passed pawns while most human players might have prefered 18. Txc1 ...} Rxf1+ 19. Kxf1 Kd7 {Maybe better 19. ... h6. But I thought that opening the 8th rank for the rook would accelerate the rooks development.} 20. Bxa6 Nd5 21. Bb5+ Kc7 22. a4 Be7 {Offering the bishops exchange aiming on releasing white's pressure.} 23. Bc1 Kb6 {The black king is infighting trying to stop the passed pawns.} 24. b3 Nc3 {Aiming on exchanging the bishop b5 to destroy white's strong bishop pair.} 25. Bc4 Rd8 26. a5+ Kb7 27. Bd2 Ne4 28. a6+ Kb6 29. Be3 Bc5 30. a7 Kb7 {Of course not 30. ... Kxa7 because of 31. Sc6 ... +.  Black has solved all problems. There is no danger that the passed pawn could be promoted.} 31. Nb5 {That defends the passed pawn. -White must have planned this move when he moved 28. a6+ ... .} Bxe3 { But destroying my opponents strong bishop pair improved my prospects.} 32. fxe3 Nd2+ 33. Ke2 Nxc4 34. bxc4 Ka8 35. g3 {So what to do for black to counter white's initative? The only chance I saw was to push forward my kings flank pawns.} h5 36. e4 g5 37. h3 Rd7 {A kind of wait-and-see-move. I didn't like 37. ... h4 because I thought this would give white the opportunity to block the kings flank.} 38. h4 {I thought that 38. ... gxh4 39. gxh4 Rd8 would have been too slow and I didn't see how to advance at the kings flank. So I decided to push the g-pawn forward and to try to break through with the rook on the d-file.} g4 39. Ke3 Rd1 40. Kf4 Rd3 {40. ... Rc1 is met by 41. Kg5 ... So Black has no time to lose.} 41. c5 {Obviously dreaming of promoting one of the passed pawns. But black's king and rook are strong enough to defend this threat. In the end this attempt loses a pawn for white.} Rb3 42. Nd6 Kxa7 {White has lost a pawn. Black's pawn f7 is defended tactically.} 43. Kg5 Rxg3 44. Kxh5 Rg1 45. Kg5 g3 46. Kg4 g2 {There is no real chance for black to promote his passed pawn. So this manoeuvre is just an attempt looking if black treats this episode fine. } 47. Kh3 Kb8 48. Kh2 Rh1+ 49. Kxg2 Rxh4 50. Kf2 {So what has black to do next? Attacking white's pawn c5!} Kc7 51. Ke3 Kc6 52. Nxf7 Kxc5 {Black is still a pawn up but still the position should be almost equal because for the moment white can defend his pawns and it is hard to see how black can progress. Meanwhile I had been contented with a draw, but my opponent declined my draw offer. So I was forced to play for a win. :-)} 53. Nd8 Rh6 54. Kd3 Rh3+ 55. Ke2 Kd4 {Black has to exchange or better to erase white's pawns to progress.} 56. Nxe6+ Kxe5 {56. ... Kxe4? is met by 57. Ng5+ ...} 57. Ng5 Rg3 {Overcoming white's defense of his pawn.} 58. Nf3+ Kxe4 {Okay folks, from now on only black can hope for a win. But already Wilhelm Steinitz knew that this endgame of black rook vs. white knight is equal if white succeeds in keeping a close connection between king and knight. So my only chance was to try to create difficulties for my opponent in that. } 59. Nd2+ Kf4 60. Kf2 Rc3 61. Ke2 Rh3 {Aiming to force back the black king on the first line to intensify white's problems to keep the connection between king and knight.} 62. Kf2 Rh2+ {Succeeded in forcing back the white king.} 63. Ke1 {63. ... Ke3? aiming for a mate is of course met my 64. Nf1+ ...  So the rook has to leave the square h2 first.} Rh1+ {Aiming for a mate on the first line. } 64. Ke2 Rh3 65. Kf2 Rh2+ 66. Ke1 Rg2 {Okay that didnt't work and I had to concentrate on escaping the threefold repetition.} 67. Kd1 Ke3 {For a moment the contact between king and knight is interrupted because of black's pressure. But until now this isn't enough for black to win.} 68. Nb3 Rb2 69. Nc1 {The only move that keeps the connection between king and knight and thus keeps white in the game. For example 69. Na1 ... ? is met by 69. ... Rb1+.} Rh2 {I was trying to keep the king locked in lying in wait for the critical mistake.} 70. Nb3 {Again the only move. } Kd3 {Threatening the mate on the first line.} 71. Nc5+ {The critical mistake! Now the white knight is seperated from his king and will fall prey to black sooner or later. Obviously my opponent didn’t knew the aforementioned rule for this endgame. It’s notable that even today strong engines have problems to realize that from now on white is lost. Even after deep calculation they admire 71. Nc5+ .. , 71. Nc1+ ... and 71. Ke1 ... as equal. But only 71. Nc1+ ... is drawish while 71. Nc5+ ... ? and also 71. Ke1 ... ? lose. So the consequences of his move must have been beyond my opponents horizon.} Kd4 72. Na6 {Or 72. Nb3+ Kc3 and then 73. Nc5 Rh4 or 73. Nc1 Rh1+ or 73. Na5 Rh4 and so on. There is no way back for the white knight.} Rb2 73. Nc7 Ke5 74. Ke1 {Or 74. Na8 Kd6 or 74. Ne8 Rb7.} Rb7 75. Na6 Kd6 76. Ke2 Rb6 {As I mentioned there is no way out for the white knight.} 77. Nc7 Kxc7 {The rest is silence. That indeed was a lot of hard work, folks! }
