[Opening "Queen's pawn (D00), stonewall attack"]

1. d4 {My opponent starts with queen pawn, an opening that I found effective that day at school in a game against one of my friends.} d5 {I reply, mirroring my opponent, with not much experience of how to reply, I choose the most popular reply.} 2. e3 {Blocks in the black-squared bishop, not a move that I use anymore except in gambits…} c5 {…Like the one I am playing now.} 3. dxc5 {He takes my pawn. I have not yet figured out what is better: Capturing or protecting, in these gambit positions in the early game.} Nc6 {The next move of the gambit.} 4. c4 {Hmmm… probably wants to prevent the double pawns on the c-file.} Nf6 {I ignore and protect instead.} 5. Nc3 {Uh-oh. Now my pawn is being threatened by my opponents pawn, his knight, and his queen.} e6 {So, naturally, I protect, also threatening the pawn with my bishop.} 6. Nf3 {Opens up the other knight.} Bxc5 {I take the pawn, and the gambit is complete.} 7. cxd5 {He takes my pawn, but I am well prepared for this attack.} exd5 {My pawn takes back.} 8. Bb5 {Pins my knight to king. That can be annoying.} O-O {I castle, and I am now out of the pin.} 9. Bxc6 {Takes the knight with the bishop. I still don't which is worth more: knight or bishop.} bxc6 {I take back, obviously.} 10. Ne5 {Threatening my c-pawn.} Qd6 {I protect my pawn and threaten his knight.} 11. f4 {Protects with the pawn.} Be6 {I open up my bishop. Bg4 is more attacking, but the queen can easily move out of the way.} 12. O-O {Castles. With the f-pawn gone the king is open to diagonals and I have the e-pawn is pinned, which can come in handy.} Rfd8 {Now that I look at it, I see that the d-5 pawn has enough protection. :D} 13. h3 {A nothing move, should be getting out the bishop or something.} d4 {I threaten the knight, preparing for my pawn to be taken by my opponents, and then I will take back and check the king.} 14. exd4 {As planned.} Bxd4+ {I take the pawn and check the king.} 15. Kh1 {Moves into the corner.} Bxc3 {I take the knight with my bishop.} 16. Qxd6 {Accepts the swap.} Rxd6 {I take back, protecting my pawn on c6.} 17. bxc3 {Takes my bishop.} Rad8 {Doubling up rooks can be dangerous for the opponent, and I see Rd1, a swap of rooks and then I will check the king.} 18. Bb2 {Prevents my plan.} Bc8 {I move back in order to play Bb7, so if I want do something with my rook, My c-pawn will be protected.} 19. Ba3 {Threatens the rook.} Rd6d2 {I move out of the way and see that the rook and bishop could possibly meet on g2.} 20. Be7 {Threatens my other bishop. Argh!} Rd8d5 {One of my only free squares.} 21. Nxc6 {Takes the pawn and threatens my a-pawn threatens the pawn.} Bb7 {Now I see a possibility: 22. Na7 Ra5 or Rd8, knight or bishop retreats 23. Bg2. Checks the king and wins a rook.} 22. Nd4 {My opponent sees the threat and retreats.} Rd7 {My plan could still work.} 23. Nf3 {As I made my twenty-second move, I rejoiced… Until my opponent moved. :(} Re2 {I get out of the threat and threaten the bishop.} 24. Rfd1 {Not a good move: Rxd1 25. Rxd1 Rxe7 26. Rd8 Re8. But I didn't see that. } Rxd1+ {I take.} 25. Rxd1 {Takes back. obviously, but this is where I go wrong:} h6 {I could have taken the free bishop.} 26. Bxf6 {Takes my knight, and messes up my pawns.} gxf6 {I take back.} 27. a4 {Pushes up a pawn.} Bc6 {I threaten the pawn with my bishop.} 28. a5 {Moves out of the way.} Ra2 {I threaten with my rook down the a-file.} 29.

Rxf6 {And he takes mine.} Kg7 {I threaten the rook and protect my pawn.} 34. Rc6 {The rook retreats.} f6 {I push up my pawn, and now I can move my king up the g-file.} 35. Rc7+ {Checks me, this does nothing, I was going to move my king anyway.} Kg6 {I move my king in between my two pawns, I am safe for the moment.} 36. c4 {Pushes up a pawn.} Kh5 {I block my opponent's king's way of escaping into my half of the board.} 37. c5 {Pushes his pawn further, he's going for a queen.} Ra1 {I push my rook all the way to the 1st rank.} 38. Kh2 {His king moves away from his slightly trapped position.} Ra2+ {Now, as I look at the board, I would've pushed my king to h4, but this what I played.} 39. Kg3 {Moves his king back.} Ra1 {I push my rook back, hoping for three-fold repetition.} 40. c6 {My opponent sees that there is no danger, and continues his run for a queen.} Rg1+ {I check the king.} 41. Kf2 {Threatens my rook.} Rh1 {I threaten his pawn.} 42. Kg2 {Threatens my rook and protects his pawn.} Rc1 {My opponent could swap pawns, but his pawn is more advanced, so it wouldn't be worth it.} 43. Rc8 {He pushes his rook onto the 8th rank.} Rc2+ {I check the king.} 44. Kf1 {Moves out of the way.} a5 {Now its my turn to run for it…} 45. c7 {His rook is trapped unless he wants to give up his highly advance pawn.} a4 {I run for it.} 46. Ke1 {The king is going to threat me.} a3 {But I ignore it, because the threat will do nothing.} 47. Kd1 {Threatens my rook.} a2 {Now, my opponent can take the rook and I get a queen. Or he can swap pawns.} 48. Ra8 {He decides to swap pawns.} Rxc7 {I take his advance pawn.} 49. Rxa2 {And he takes mine. Now its a game of few pieces.} Rc3 {I threaten his pawn.} 50. Ke2 {Protects with the king. I can win the h-pawn.} Kh4 {I threaten the h-pawn, who has no escape.} 51. Ra6 {So my opponent goes for a swap.} Kxh3 {I accept it.} 52. Rxf6 {He takes my pawn.} Kg3 {I threaten his pawn, and if he accepts another swap, then he will have a pawn and rook and I will have a rook.} 53. Rg6+ {He checks me instead. A bad move. I will benefit from this.} Kxf4 {I take his pawn.} 54. Rg4+ {He checks me.} Kf5 {I retreat.} 55. Rh4 {Threatens my pawn.} Rc2+ {I check the king.} 56.
