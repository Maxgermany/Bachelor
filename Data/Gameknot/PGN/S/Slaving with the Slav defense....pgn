1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. c4 c6 4. Nc3 a6 5. Bg5 {This is a true gambit; black decides, to accept it...} dxc4 6. a4 {Or else b5, and the pawn is lost...} h6 7. Bh4 {Safer seems Bxf6, gxf6, e3...} b5 {A very daring idea; defending a gambit pawn is considered bad practice...} 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nxb5 axb5 10. Rxa8 Bb7 11. Ra1 {Considering, what is following now, white had better played 11. Ra7 Qb6 12. Rxb7... This rook is useless, from now on...} g5 12. Bg3 e6 13. e3 {After Nd2, Bb4 also...} Bb4+ 14. Ke2 Nc6 {Somewhat better looks 14. ... Ne4, followed by Nxg3, and h5... But we are following McShane...} 15. Ne1 {Preparing Nc2, plus some relief...} Na5 {My choice would have been 15. ... Nd5 16. Nc2 Be7 17. h3 b4 18. Bh2 0-0... But I am not capable of slaying Aronian...} 16. Be5 {After 16. Nc2 Be7 17. f3 g4! 18. Kf2 Nh5 19. f4 Nxg3 20. hxg3 h5, all is well for black...} O-O 17. h4 {After Nc2, Be7, h4, g4...} g4 18. Nc2 Be7 19. Ke1 {Finally, some air around the King... After 19. f3? Nb3 20. Ra2 (Ra7, Qb6, Ra2, or Ra7, gxf3, Ra2) gxf3 21. gxf3 Bxf3! 22. Kxf3 Qd5+...} Nb3 20. Ra2 {After 20. Bxf6 Bxf6 21. Qxg4+ Kh8 22. Ra7 e5!, black is opening all lines to the white King... After 20. Ra7 Qb6 21. Ra2...} h5 {Again, I disagree with McShane... My choice would have been 20 ... Kh7, rendering Qxg4 useless...} 21. f3 {So far, my opponent had been a great sport about this game... We were following Aronian - McShane, knowing that Aronian would lose this game... Were were both permitted, to derive from this game when ever so desired... Aronian continued 21. Be2 Bd6 22. f3 Nd5 23. fxg4? Bxe5 24. dxe5 Qb6! (threatens Rd8!) 25. Bf3 and lost, after Nxe3, Nxe3, Qxe3+ (look up the game for your selves)... So my opponent wanted to improve on this... He has a broad edge, plus he's 2000+} gxf3 {So I decided to leave this template game too... Now, we were both on our own... Let's call it a running start, not unlikely against a supposed stronger opponent...} 22. gxf3 Kh7 23. Kf2 {After 23. Bg2 Rg8! 24. Kf2 Nd5 25. Bg3 Qb6! spells mayhem...} Ng4+ 24. fxg4 f6 {Black's sacrifice is correct, Be5 is trapped... 25. Bg3 Bxh1 26. Bxc4 bxc4 27. Qxh1 Qd7 28. Ra6 e5!} 25. Bc7 {But this is no solution...} Qxc7 26. Rh3 Bd6 {Now, Bd6 is real fine; at this moment white's position begins to crack...} 27. Na3 {Nothing else, left...} Bc6 28. Nb1 {Better try 28. Bxc4 bxc4 29. Nxc4 Be4 30. Nxd6 Qxd6 31. Ra7+ Kh6 32. Qxb3 hxg4 33. Rg3 Rc8 34. Ra1 Rc2+ 35. Qxc2 Bxc2 36. Rxg4, with still fighting chances...} e5 29. d5 {Forced... 29. Nc3 exd4 30. exd4 Qb6!} Bd7 30. Qc2+ {Not too accurate... After 30. gxh5 f5! 31. Qc2+ e4, white is somewhat better off...} e4 {Of course...} 31. Qxe4+ {Trying to make someting, out of nothing... Best is 31. Rh1 Bc5, and recuperate} f5 {Devastating...} 32. Qc2 hxg4 33. Rh1 Bc5 {Threatens Qe5. plus g3+...} 34. Kg2 Bxe3 {Threatens deadly Qf4... By the way, the same move which won the game for McShane, against Aronian...} 35. Bxc4 {Tougher is 35. Bd3 Nd4 36. Qd1 cxd3 37. Nc3 f4 38. Rh2 f3+ 39. Kh1 Nf5 40. Ne4} Nd4 {White resigns, after Qf4, it is over...}
