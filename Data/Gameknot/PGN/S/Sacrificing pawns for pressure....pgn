1. e4 b6 {Owen's defense...} 2. d4 Bb7 3. Nc3 e6 4. Bf4 {I aim at the weak c7 square.} Bb4 5. Qd2 {!? I jetson my first pawn.} Bxe4 6. a3 Bxc3 7. Qxc3 {I threaten to regain it with a superior position.} d6 8. Bb5+ {I sink a bishop in...} Nd7 9. f3 Bb7 10. O-O-O Ngf6 11. Re1 {I create a pin that while it doesn't last, comes back and destroys him.} Nd5 12. Qd2 a6 13. Bc4 Nxf4 14. Qxf4 d5 15. Bd3 {I start to prepare a kingside assault.} Nf6 16. Ne2 c5 17. Ng3 O-O {?? THis makes trouble for black. He would have been better off on the queen side.} 18. Re5 {Stronger would be h4!} c4 19. Be2 Qd6 {The crushing blow comes.} 20. h4 {This was overdue.

Bxf5 Nxf5 41. Rxf5 {The pin is exploited in the worst may possible. My passed pawn will bring home victory!} Rg8 42. Nf6 Rg1+ {Needed was Rh8.} 43. Kb2 Raa1 44. h6 b4 {Threatening mate...} 45. c3 bxc3+ 46. Kxc3 Rgc1+ 47. Kb2 Rch1 {It is too late.} 48. h7 Rag1 {This fails miserably.} 49. Nh5 {He timed out. I was winning anyway.}
