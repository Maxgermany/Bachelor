[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 e5 {Standard King's Pawn opening } 2. Bb5 {A strange move already - if there is a name for this opening, I certainly don't know it! } Nf6 {The bishop doesn't threaten anything at the moment, so I ignore it. This move develops, threatens the e-pawn and stops White's idea of Qg4 (if that was his idea - it probably wasn't) straight away } 3. d3 {White defends the e-pawn } Bc5 {Nf6 and Bc5 (or Nf3 and Bc4) are common themes in my King's Pawn games } 4. Nc3 O-O 5. Nf3 {simple development so far - Black castles his king to safety and White brings out both of his knights } d5 {!? Black starts to get aggressive, with a pawn stab at the centre - but maybe better was Re8, offering protection to the hanging pawn at e5 } 6. Bg5 {either White just didn't see it or he chose not to capture it. This is a standard pin on the queen...or is it? } Qd6 {Black brings out his queen, which breaks the queen and provides protection the the e-pawn } 7. Qd2 {Develops the last piece, but I'm not sure if this is White's best move - perhaps better was 7.Bxf6 (where either Black has to bust up his pawn structure or lose a pawn; 7...Qxf6 8.Nxd5 Qd6 [White threatens Nxc7] 9.Nc3 [to avoid the pawn fork at c6]) } c6 {Now White loses the threat of the pawn advantage, the d-pawn is backed up and the bishop is driven back - not a bad move! (the loss of the outpost for the knight doesn't seem that bad, since there's still Nd7, but it turns out that Black never needed the knight in the final attack } 8. Ba4 {the only square for the bishop } Bg4 {To me, this was the best square to develop the bishop to. Of course, there is no pin on the knight, so... } 9. O-O-O {? Wait, scratch that, there's a pin (though it is consistant with White's 7th move). This alone should have stopped White from castling queenside (kingside castling would be better) but it turns out, though neither of us saw it, that this allows for a powerful attack later on... } Bb4 {Black had been threatening this since last move - Black now threatens to win the c3 knight with d4 } 10. a3 {The White queen has only one safe square to break the pin - Qe2 (Qe3? d4!) } Ba5 {maintaining the pin (it's here when I started the idea of an attack should White play b4...which he does...) } 11. b4 {I guess that White either just didn't want to move the queen, or he wanted to keep the queen on the d2 square (perhaps hoping that Black would play h6, where he has the option of Bxh6, similar to what I did, actually... I've tried this before, with not much luck. It has also happened to me before, with great success for my opponent) At any rate, weakening the defence around the king is never good, and Black may, in the near future, be able to take advantage of it... } Bxb4 {!! That 'near future' comes sooner than White expected! Black sacs his bishop for two pawns. The way I see it, there are three major factors that made this successful; 1) The sac has occurred at the uncastled positon; i.e. the rook is on the end file. 2) It's difficult for White to get his pieces to the defence and 3) The pieces that are queenside prove to be more of a hinderance, as it allows Black's pawns to advance with tempo } 12. axb4 {White accepts the bait - It seems forced to me. If White ignores, d4 still wins material  } Qxb4 {The knight is still threatened with d4, as it is tied down to the defence of the bishop } 13. Bb3 {Forced, if White wants to retain his material advantage } a5 {Here come the pawns! } 14. Na4 {? White tries to provoke a trade of queens, but of course, Black doesn't need to follow through with it. I think White's best bet would have been to move the queen or rook and retreat the king away from queenside. After this move, however, Black's attack becomes unstoppable, and Black is assured at least a gain in material } Qa3+ {! declining the exchange with tempo } 15. Kb1 {Forced; Nb2 loses to Qa1# } b5 {reinforcing the folly of White's Na4 - Black gets in another tempo attack with his pawns } 16. Nb2 {Again, forced if White wants to avoid losing material - Alt. variation; [1] 16.Nc3 a4 17.Ba2 b4 [2] 16.Nb6 Ra6 (in both cases, the knight is doomed) } a4 {attacking... } 17. Ba2 {again, forced in terms of retaining material (even a sacrifice doesn't work in this position - 17.Bxd5 cxd5 18.exd5 doesn't do much to stop the oncoming a and b pawns, and 17.Bxa4 bxa4 18.Nxa4 Rxa4 and White can't stop mate...though maybe White won't play Nxa4... this would slow the attack, but Black would be left with a strong passed pawn on the a-file) } b4 {Again, White's move are forced to stop mate, but that would mean White giving up on his knight and bishop - 18.Kc1 Qxa2 19.[The queen moves off the d2 square] Qa1+ 20.Kd2 Qxb2... } 18. h3 {White desperately tries to distract Black, but that won't work! I wouldn't blame White though - the position that is reached after 18.Kc1 is horrible! } b3 {White can still stop mate - 19.cxb3 axb3 20.Kc1 bxa2 21.[Q move] a1=Q+ 22.Kd2 Qa1xb2+, but who would want that? } 19. Bxf6 {One last try to distract Black - 19...gxf6 20.Nxe5 fxe5?? 21.Qg5!! and White escapes with a draw } Qxa2+ {Black now has a mate in 2, and White resigns }
