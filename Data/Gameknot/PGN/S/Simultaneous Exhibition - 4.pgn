[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {Perhaps hoping to draw his opponent into a Ruy Lopez, where Canal's own theoretical innovation is now immortalized as the Canal Variation.} d5 {The amateur starts the fireworks immediately, choosing the aggressive, if not entirely theoretically sound, Center Counter Defense.} 2. exd5 {The natural move.} Qxd5 {The immediate recapture, exposing the Queen to danger.} 3. Nc3 {Development with gain of time, attacking the Queen.} Qa5 {The usual move, setting up a potential pin on the White QN.} 4. d4 {Canal's move activates the pin but seizes central space.} c6 {Creating a potential line of retreat for the Q.} 5. Nf3 {Canal resumes his development and guards the QP.} Bg4 {The amateur develops another piece and establishes a second pin.} 6. Bf4 {Canal seizes an open diagonal for his Bishop.} e6 {The amateur opens a diagonal for the development of *his* Bishop.} 7. h3 {Canal "puts the question"...} Bxf3 {...and gets an answer.} 8. Qxf3 {Canal completes the exchange and clears the way for potential Q-side castling.} Bb4 {The amateur develops a piece and adds force to the pin on the QN.} 9. Be2 {Canal clears the last minor piece off his first rank.} Nd7 {The amateur prepares to castle Queen-side.} 10. a3 {Now Canal "puts the question" to the other Black Bishop.} O-O-O {The amateur sees that 11 PxB can be answered by 11...QxR ch, and ignores the threat in favor of castling.} 11. axb4 {Canal plays PxB anyway.} Qxa1+ {The natural response.} 12. Kd2 {Canal could have interposed with his B or N at Q1, but prefers the "two-Rook sacrifice".} Qxh1 {The amateur, naturally, accepts the sacrifice. He silently tells Canal, "Prove it!"} 13. Qxc6+ {Another sacrifice! First both Rooks and now the Queen.} bxc6 {Forced.} 14. Ba6# {Who needs Rooks or Queens when you can mate with Bishops? Well done by Canal.}
