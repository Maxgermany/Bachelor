1. d4 {I'm playing black.  This was just a tough battle won by interesting kingside positional movement. } d6 2. e4 c5 3. Nf3 g6 4. c4 Bg7 {This is my lame attempt at the sicillian defense.  I'm no pro, and have no clue how this actually works....} 5. Be3 cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nc6 7. Nc3 Nxd4 8. Bxd4 e5 9. Be3 Ne7 10. Bd3 O-O {Well, it ended up similar to the sicillian...} 11. O-O Be6 12. b3 Nc6 13. Qc2 Nb4 14. Qd2 Nxd3 15. Qxd3 f5 16. f3 f4 {I'm sure he assumed I would take xe4} 17. Bf2 a6 {no need for a free piece, and I block his knight} 18. Nd5 {he says oh yeah FU I'm gonna move him anyways. } Bxd5 {so I kill him} 19. cxd5 {so now we have a nice little pawn arrangement, hell actually} Kh8 {I have noticed a way to infiltrate his king side, and I must make this king move in order to do so.} 20. Rac1 {he makes a series of moves, not really knowing exactly what's coming...} g5 21. a4 Rg8 22. b4 Bh6 {bishop here in case once everything clears out I may get a shot at the rook on c1} 23. b5 {I don't care about his moves right now, plus I'm sure he'd rather not have my rook roaming around freely on the backside, so I know he's not going to take.} g4 24. b6 g3 {look at the wall-o-pawn!} 25. hxg3 fxg3 26. Be3 {of course} Qh4 {now I believe he's beginning to get worried about what's to come. } 27. Rfd1 {avoiding mate} Qh2+ 28. Kf1 Qh1+ 29. Ke2 Qxg2+ 30. Ke1 Qh1+ 31. Kd2 {FLEE WILDLY KING, FLEE FLEE FLEE!} Bxe3+ 32. Qxe3 {I believe he is more concerned about my pawn advancement than anything else.  He's got 3 major pieces aimed at the g1 square...} Qh2+ 33. Kc3 {This was the move I was hoping for, he would've been better off on d3} Qa2 {SURPRISE!} 34. Rca1 Rac8+ 35. Kb4 Rc4+ 36. Ka5 Rxa4# {AND THAT'S THE GAME!}
