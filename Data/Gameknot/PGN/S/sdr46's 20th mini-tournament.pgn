Nc3 Nf6 {We are now in the Ck b13- Panov-Botvinnilk Attack. So far .so good} 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Bd3 {Good spot to post f1 bishop.} Bb4 {Let try a pin} 8. O-O a6 {This was a waste moved at this time of the game. dxc4 was much better.} 9. Bg5 {This pin was quite problematic for me. Looking at the last move,I may have wanted to prevent the kn from going to b5 and return the Be7} O-O {Did I really nned to castle at this time?} 10. cxd5 Bxc3 {I thougth this was to regain my pawn. a way} 11. bxc3 exd5 {This last exchange made the problem of the pinned kn even worse.
