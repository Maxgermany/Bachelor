[Opening "Vienna game (C26)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Vienna Game - "Willkommen bei Wien"} Nf6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. Nf3 {Italian Game - "Benvenuti in Italia"} Nc6 {There's something to be said about the beauty of symmetry.} 5. O-O a6 {Allowing the Bishop to retreat while holding the diagonal in the face of a d4-push. } 6. a4 {I sacrifice influence on the b4 square for play on b5. Black should probably play Nxe4 or O-O sometime soon. } Nb4 {I think Black should have played 6. ...Nxe4 7.Nxe4 d5 for a more comfortable middle-game.  Edit: Ignore the above. Thanks l-d-j for reminding me about the Bishop on c5. Black should have just castled instead.} 7. Ng5 d5 {A very natural play but the timing seems wrong.} 8. exd5 Nfxd5 {Black decides to keep a Knight posted on the untouchable b4 spot. This threatens a possible Nxc2 and fork attacks in the future. This move also appears to leave my own Knight awkwardly en prise. A possible (read mundane) continuation is: 9.Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Qxd5 11. Qf3 which retains material equality but obliterates my centre.  Edit: After further review I realize this is a horrible position for Black. } 9. Nxf7 {9. Nxf7! In the heat of a blitz game calculations are rarely exact. I played this move in the hope of getting some tactical fun out of what seemed like a rigid position. At the time it seemed dodgy but I have not found a refutation to it. An even stronger play was 9. Nxd5 Nxd5 10. d4 Bxd4 11. c3 } Kxf7 10. Qh5+ {Note: 10. Nxd5 Nxd5 11. Qf3 or Qh5+ is equally playable} Kf6 {While there are really no "good" moves left for Black, this one is "less good" than most others.} 11. Ne4+ {I reclaim some lost material.} Ke6 12. Nxc5+ Kd6 13. d4 Re8 14. Rd1 {All guns to the fore now.} Nxc2 15. dxe5+ Kxc5 16. Rxd5+ Qxd5 17. Bxd5 Kxd5 {I was surprised that Black did not grab the Rook. Didn't matter really. It's all downhill from here anyway.} 18. e6+ {18.Qxe8 Nxa1 19. e6 Bxe6 20. Qxa8 wins both Rooks...} Kxe6 19. Qxe8+ {... but I don't need to axe both Rooks and a strong pin like this incapacitates 2 pieces for the price of a pawn.} Kf6 20. Rb1 c6 21. b3 {Prepares the long diagonal for the Bishop.} Nb4 22. Bb2+ {Time to bring this puppy home. I had to keep an eye on the clock.} Kg5 23. Qe7+ Kg6 24. Qxg7+ Kf5 25. g4+ Kf4 26. Be5+ {This was a glaring error on my part. I knew that the instant I moved. I should have played Qd4+ instead. The Bishop is awkwardly placed making the mate process longer than it had to be. } Kf3 27. Qf6+ Kxg4 {That's better. Mate is in sight. All forced moves now.} 28. f3+ Kh5 29. h4 h6 30. Bf4 Nd5 31. Qxh6# {This is definitely a learning game. I hope it is an eye-opener to others interested in the sharp attacking possibilities of Classical lines.}
