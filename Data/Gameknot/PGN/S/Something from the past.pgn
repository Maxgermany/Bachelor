[Opening "Scotch opening (C44)"]

1. e4 {This was my favourite (only) opening at this point in may career - like Mr. Fischer said e4!} e5 {My oppenent responds in kind.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Scotch Game - played before Mr. Kasparov made it "more" famous - the year that this was played, I suffered no loss with this opening and my opponent had felt the hammer before so he tried something new .... (the Scotch is reconned second best after Bd5 - Spanish Game - since the Spanish develops a piece here)} Nf6 {threatens the unprotected e4 pawn} 4. Nc3 {Protects the pawn and develops - now we have a four Knights game with d4} Qe7 {this one was completely new to me - obviously it threatens the e4 pawn after exd4, but I decided to try the pin now} 5. Bg5 {pins the Nf6} Qd6 {unpins, but now White has several targets} 6. d5 Ne7 {this move made me see visions of chasing the Queen - since her road is blocked thus ...} 7. Nb5 Qb6 {Better was Qb4 , now White aims at c7 with a fork} 8. Be3 {threatens the Queen} Qa5+ 9. c3 {now White threatens b4, when the Queen succumbs to a fork, but my oppenents' solution allowed for a beautifull finish.} c6 {intending Qc8 after b4 - Can you see what Black missed ?} 10. b4 Qd8 11. Nd6# {And its mate with all the pieces on the board !!!}
