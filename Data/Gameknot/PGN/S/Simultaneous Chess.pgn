1. e4 {Hello everyone and thank you for giving up a few moments to see this annotated game :) This was a game i played in simultaneous chess against my chess teacher in chess club (i was not playing simultaneoulsly if you are wondering that). In a real game, my teacher would play as white, but he was so confident about winning all the games, he put himself as black in all the games. I wrote down the moves against my teacher, and decided to annotate it here.} e6 {If you are an intermediate player, you might have noticed that this is the French Defence. This used to be my favorate opening, but i gave up on it recently. while looking at the other games, i noticed that my tutor played different openings against all of us (either it was the Sicilian, Alkaline Defence or the French Defence.} 2. d4 d5 {Here i wondered what would be a sensible variation to play. Maybe the Exchange Variation because of his strong rating, but i have not really learnt it.} 3. Nc3 {I decided to play the Winewar Variation (i think i spelt it wrong) because it defends the pawn on e4 effectively, and because it is favoured by GMs.} Bb4 {This caused me some trouble. i have not seen this before. i knew that my e-pawn was in trouble, and that i risk doubling up my pawns.} 4. Nge2 {probobly not the best move, but i chose it because:  1. it develops the knight. 2. if Bxc3, Nxc3 and my e-pawn is defended. 3. it stops my pawns from doubling up.} dxe4 {i saw this coming, but it did not bother me too much. my simple plan was to play 5. a3 Ba5 16. b4 Bb6 17. Nxe4.} 5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. Nxc3 Nf6 {damn! i did not see that Nf6 could simply be played to defend. it is never good to be a center pawn down against a Grade 189 chess teacher :)} 7. Be3 {can't remember why i played it. I think it was because i did not want white to play Nc6 and put pressure on the pawn. i think i played it so Nc6 won't bother me too much.} Nc6 {not a bad move to play at all...} 8. Bb5 {just hoping to weaken Mr. Briscoe's grip on the centre} O-O 9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. O-O Rb8 {some candy for guessing why he played that move :)} 11. b4 Ba6 {a good developing move.} 12. Re1 Bc4 {a very strong move. i think this is called an outpost.} 13. Bg5 {the plan is to exchange pieces, and then take the undefended pawn with Nxe4. apparently, this was quite a good move.} Bd5 {to defend the pawn (does he give up :) ). However, the pawn is also attacked by the rook as well as the knight.} 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. Nxe4 {if Bxe4, Rxe4.} Qg6 {threatening the knight on e4} 16. Qd3 {defending and chaining the rooks. I don't really know, but i think i am winning in this position. I can't really tell. If you have a view on what i think, you can write this down in the comments section. it would be appreciated :)} Rfd8 17. c4 {personally, i liked this move. it fights for the centre, sets up a nice pawn structure, and it forces Bxe4.} Bxe4 18. Rxe4 e5 {clever move. if dxe5, Rxd3! and if Rxe5, Qxd3!} 19. d5 {for me, advancing was the right thing to do.} cxd5 20. cxd5 c6 {ouch! i had lost the pawn on d5. i knew that defending it is a hopeless task...} 21. Qe3 {...so i will take one of his pawns if he takes my pawns.} cxd5 22. Rxe5 d4 {good move to cause some trouble.} 23. Qe4 d3 24. Qe3 d2 25. Rd1 Qc2 {after a few OK moves, it reached one of the most complicated positions i had ever encountered. i had to look ahead quite away, and so did white. my teacher told me he will allow me more time to make my move, otherwise, i might mess up.} 26. Qe2 {i thought this was the best move for me.} Rbc8 {not so obvious at first, but after a lot of thinking, i saw it was a lost cause. the most i can do is stop the pawn from queening, then go a rook down.} 27. Rxd2 Qc1+ 28. Qe1 Qxe1+ {personally, i would have played Rxd2 instead of Qxe1. it puts black in a better position.} 29. Rxe1 Rxd2 30. h3 Rcd8 31. Kh2 Rd2d1 {lunch was over, and the game had to be judged. it was a win for black.  Thank you for your time. i hope you enjoyed the game, and all comments would be appreciated. Goodbye!}
