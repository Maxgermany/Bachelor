1. e4 c5 2. d4 {In front of a sicilian, I always play this variation, probably not the best one but I like the central game as well.} cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {White gets a good developpement advance} e6 5. Nf3 {absolutly classical} Bc5 6. Bf4 {Developping as quickly as possible.} Qb6 {It doesn't seem a good move to me because it has little effect and exposes the queen} 7. Qc2 {protecting both f2 and e4, not a bad place for the queen} Nc6 {Black is getting agressive} 8. a3 {To prevent knight, bishop or queen to come on e4} Qa5 {I do not feel safe at all with those 3 pieces out and the kight pinned} 9. Bc4 {Permitting the castle} a6 10. O-O {Casteling, I feel released. And I'll quickly counterattack, aiming at the queen} Qd8 {No, I won't counterattack but the black queen is away and I'm well in advance as for developpement.} 11. Rad1 {Now, the plan is to take control of d6 and d7} Nge7 12. b4 {It has nothing to do with my main plan but it's not bad to force the opponents pieces to drawback. furthermore, the dark saquared bishop will no longer control c2} Ba7 13. Rd3 {Back to the plan : attacking d7} O-O {I wrote on my notes at this point : carefull, my pieces are bad protected.} 14. Rfd1 {Still aiming at d7, too sure of my position, I didn't try to protect my bishops, Be3 would have been better} b5 {I did the same, it seems fair.} 15. Ba2 {I want the bishop to stay on this diagonal and to be able to come on the b1h7 as well because I'm beginning to think to another plan : directly attacking the king. My pieces are not badly placed for it.} Ng6 {Black has to develop} 16. Be3 {the unprotected pieces (see anotation on 13th move) are under attack.} Bxe3 17. Rxe3 {One pawn late but still a good position} Nce5 {White's knights are getting annoying} 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 19. f4 {Now white's plan is definitely to attack on the queen side with as many pieces as possible.} Qb6 {But... but...} 20. Rde1 Ng4 {This knight is getting VERY annoying !!!} 21. Qd2 {I have no other choice as the rook is pinned} Nxe3 22. Rxe3 {minus 3, the late in material is getting preoccupating but I still have a plan} Bb7 23. Kh1 {First secure the king (one time is enough !)} Rfd8 {That doesn't bother me a lot. As I'm about to attack the kingside, the rook on the center will facilitate it. Anyway, I won't try to prevent black to play d5} 24. Rg3 {First move of my attack, I need 3 tempi to get dangerous for white. I hope my opponent won't find any quicker attack.} Rac8 {OK, no immediate danger. d5 would have been a better move, in my opinion} 25. f5 {So I carry on my plan} exf5 {One more pawn in late but now I'm sure to have time enough to aim my attack. Of course, the black queen on b6 prevents the best move I have (26. Qh6)} 26. Qg5 {If 26. ... Qg6 27. Qe7 menacing 28. Bf7+ Just sad that my last knight is blocked (preventing 27. Rc1 mate)} g6 {It's forced move (see anotation 25th move)} 27. exf5 {logical and efficient} Kg7 {Only way to prevent Qh6 or f6 but black should probably have plaid 28.Rc5 to pin white's f pawn.} 28. Rh3 {aiming the attack at the h file.} Qf6 {Mistake. It doesn't solve black's problem and the attack on the c knight is too slow. Vlack sould have plaid Rh8. With his material advance, my opponent seems to underestimate the danger.} 29. Qh6+ Kg8 {Forced move (Kh8 means mate)} 30. Qxh7+ {black is doomed. I begin to see some mating sequences and I think there is nothing black can do to avoid the mate in a couple of moves.} Kf8 {Forced move.} 31. Bxf7 {! Time to set the knight in action (and sacrified the poor guy) - mate menace 1 one} Qxf7 {forced move - The mate comes near} 32. Qh8+ Qg8 {Black can do that only once } 33. Qf6+ {From now on all black's moves are forced} Ke8 {Two possibilities : wether to trade a rook against the black lady or to carry on attacking the king for he his now on the ompen file.} 34. Re3+ Qe6 {forced move.} 35. fxe6 {Black submited here but I add the mate (all moves are forced)} dxe6 36. Rxe6+ Kd7 37. Qe7# {I have the impression that both opponents made the same mistake : at one point of the game they felt too sure of themselves and underestimated the possibilities of the other side. That will be the lesson of the game.}
