1. Nf3 {I enter the final round of the Space City Open sitting on 2.5/4, and have a shot to tie for 2nd place should I win. My two wins so far have been relatively easy, and I realize that this game will be for real. My opponent, an actual adult, is rated almost 100 points higher than me, and I really need to beat him. I tell myself that since I have the white pieces, I should play with purpose and go for the throat. My buddy, who played this guy earlier and won, tells me that I should stick with the Queen's Gambit. He seems to think that holds the most promise for me. I've been playing 1. Nf3 a lot lately with really good results, and am hesitant to rock my own boat. Many times, 1. Nf3 can transpose into QG lines, but the Reti has been yielding me many good results over the last 4 months or so. I'm totally tortured as to what to open with. As my opponent and I shake hands, I still don't know what to play. He hits the clock to start the game, and I spend about 5 minutes on my first move. I'm finally reminded of the axiom my dad has said to me many times before - "Dance with the one that brung ya", and play 1. Nf3.} g6 {I don't see this move at this stage too often, and decide that a transposition into the QG may be the best idea should he aim for a Kings Indian.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. c4 {...and I prepare myself to play against the KID.} f5 {Oh crap....these Dutch type setups make me want to hurl. I simply can't stand facing them. Unbeknownst to him, my opponent is winning a psychological battle.} 4. Nc3 {Once again, an old axiom comes to mind...."When facing the uncomfortable in the opening, just play solid developing moves."} Nf6 5. g3 {I sense that the long light square diagonal seems primed for me to occupy it.} O-O {This move was played rather quickly, and I sense that my opponent is in his comfort zone. I tell myself to react sensibly, and don't give anything away in the opening. Just get developed, and look for weaknesses.} 6. Bg2 d6 {I see his LSB winding up on f7, and his Nb8 developing to d7.} 7. O-O {Staying safe, and developing my position in a natural way.} h6 {?! I really questioned this one, and went into my first real deep think of the day. What does this accomplish? Why was it played? Can I somehow exploit the real estate around his king?} 8. Re1 {Prepping e4.} Be6 9. d5 {Sensing that I may end up with fianchettos of both bishops and preventing Nc6.} Bf7 10. Qc2 {Aiming at his castled position and further reinforcing e4.} Nbd7 11. b4 {Preparing the second fianchetto while keeping him out of c5.} Rb8 {Hmmm....after the distractions of my last game, I now have an opponent who obviously thinks on a deeper level. Would he push the queenside this early?} 12. Rb1 {I'm thinking that he might, so I line up with him while removing my rook from a1 (where it may be vulnerable to attack from his DSB).} Nb6 {I didn't really anticipate this - though I should have. My c pawn is now vulnerable.} 13. Na4 {?! As soon as my hand left the piece I see the tactic. I have played right into the strength of his Rb8. All is not lost though, as the pawn he will win is on the edge and impotent.} Nxc4 {! Nice play which wins a pawn.} 14. Qxc4 {I take to protect d5 (which will be a real problem child for me in the very near future).} b5 {Of course.} 15. Qd3 {Still maintaining d5.} bxa4 16. Nd4 {! I realize (admittedly late) that I'm ok. Black can't take d5 because of my threat of Nc6.} Qd7 {Thwarting my fork potential.} 17. Nc6 {This knight reaches a strong post, and this move and the previous one force black to waste time defending against it.} Rb7 18. e4 {Time for the break, which also supports d5.} fxe4 {Black rips up the center immediately, and I calculate the next four moves succesfully. I'll still be down a pawn, but I'll have play.} 19. Bxe4 Nxe4 20. Rxe4 e6 {Just as I had calculated.} 21. dxe6 {Black now has a serious decision, and chooses correctly IMHO.} Bxe6 {Killing the passer while maintaining the threat against my knight.} 22. Nd4 {This is the picture I had in my head back after his 18th. I'm thinking I can regain my pawn after Qa3 or Qa6.} Bxd4 {Up in material, black trades down.} 23. Rxd4 {His g and h pawns are now looking tasty.} Bf5 {This move looks and feels right, but I'm not sure that my opponent saw........} 24. Qc4+ {Gaining back valuable tempo that I will need to move my Rb1 out of harms way.} Rf7 {? Huh???? What???? A self imposed pin? Why not Kh7 immediately? Or even Be6?} 25. Rb2 {Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, I get out of harms way and prepare to play Rbd2 then Bb2.} Kh7 {Protecting the hanger.} 26. Qa6 {! And I get the chance to win back my pawn, as his Rb7 must be moved or protected.} Qc8 {?! I felt that this move was weak. I anticipated Rb6, I take on a4, and he pushes c5.} 27. Qxa4 {Back to equal.} c5 {I think that the idea I just stated for black would have been more preferable here. With this move, I can now safely take on d6 and still get my queen back to d1.} 28. Rxd6 cxb4 29. Qd1 {All right - opposite colored bishops and a wide open board. I give black the edge here, as he has 2 to 1 pawns on the queenside and my bishop must be protected while it is still on c1.} Rfd7 {Encouraging a rook exchange which, IMHO, would only strengthen his 2-1 pawn advantage on the queenside.} 30. Rbd2 {Abandoning some control of b3, but I will have activity should he take.} Rxd6 31. Rxd6 b3 {Forces my longest think of the game. If I take, he retakes with his rook and I have serious issues on b1. I can't take with my queen as it would drop a piece. So....} 32. Rd2 {..... I just retreat to protect a2 and b2. My opponent is spending a lot of time in this position, and after about 15 minutes I sense that I am not going to be able to hold him off if he plays a5. I offered him a draw only when I saw him shaking his head in frustration a few times as he attempted to clear his head and started re-calculating. He eventually declined and played.......} Bc2 {...which allowed me to play......} 33. Qe2 {....which further reinforces the 2nd rank and c2 in particular. He can't play b2, as I take his bishop, and if he then promotes, I take his queen on c8 while still protecting my own bishop.} Bd3 {Reopening the line against my bishop, and forcing me back to d1.} 34. Qd1 bxa2 {He knows I'll take his bishop if he doesn't establish a new threat, so he eliminates my last queenside pawn.} 35. Rxa2 Qxc1 {?? Black folds and launches a speculative sac which I immediately identify as incorrect. He sees QxQ followed by Rb1, but fails to identify that I'll simply take his rook, he takes back with his bishop, then I take on a with a check tempo and a winning endgame.} 36. Qxc1 {This game has taken my emotions from one end of the spectrum to the other. I was even, then down, then even, then slightly better, then in dire fear of losing, then hoping for a draw, then worse, then clearly winning. Black continues with his faulty plan.} Rb1 37. Qxb1 Bxb1 38. Rxa7+ {My, oh my, how things have changed. A lapse in judgement by my opponent has yielded me a nice finish. I'd rather be lucky than good any day:) Black is now forced to the 8th rank, and my pawns are going to stay on dark squares. Now it's just a matter of getting my king up the board.} Kg8 39. f4 {Now my king can start his journey on the dark squares.} Be4 {Staying central, and looking for any mistake.} 40. Kf2 Kf8 41. Ke3 Bf5 42. Kd4 Bg4 43. Ke5 h5 44. Kf6 {...and black resigned. What a major break I caught! As I write this I still can't believe it. I finish the 2007 Space City open with 3.5 points, and as I record my result I notice that the young lady who I need to win as well still hasn't finished her game. I go over to take a look, and her game looks pretty even to me, with lots of pieces left on the board for both sides and plenty of time left. I force myself to walk away as not to jinx her, and mill around outside with the other smokers for about an hour. Then, the door opens and I see her emerge from the playing hall with a big smile. She confirms her win and we exchange high fives. We split the combined 2nd and 3rd place cash, and each walked away with $150. Overall, a really good feeling:) I hope you have enjoyed these games:) - Thomas}
