1. c4 f5 2. g4 {!? -- The Krejcik Gambit, played off of 1. c4, a pet line of mine.} fxg4 {Played after some hesitation. Might be the first time my opponent had seen 2. g4!?} 3. h3 gxh3 4. Nxh3 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 {Black is being overly cautious already. Time-tested chess rules of thumb: 1) the only way to refute a gambit is to accept it; 2) refutation demands vigorous play. Bolder is 5. ...d5.} 6. Bg2 c6 7. d4 e6 8. e4 {So now White has better development AND more space for his pawn.} Be7 9. Nf4 O-O 10. Qe2 Qc7 11. d5 exd5 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Nfxd5 Nxd5 {?? Goodnight, Irene. That move beckons mate-in-3.} 14. Bxd5+ Kh8 15. Rxh7+ {Black resigns before 15. ...Kh7  16. Qh5#}
