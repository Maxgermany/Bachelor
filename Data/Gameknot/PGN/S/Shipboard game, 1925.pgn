[Opening "Kevitz-Trajkovich defence (A50)"]

1. d4 {Marshall elects to try a QP opening.} Nf6 {Torre replies with an Indian defense.} 2. c4 {Book play.} Nc6 {I believe Alekhine was the man who popularized moving both Knights out before moving the Pawns as Black in this position. I'm sure someone will correct me if I am mistaken.} 3. d5 {Kicking at the Knight.} Ne5 {Centralizing it beautifully in response.} 4. b3 {Solidifying his Pawn chain.} e6 {Opening a line for the Q and B, while attacking the advanced QP.} 5. Bb2 {Attacking the advanced Knight.} Bb4+ {Developing aggressively and setting a pitfall.} 6. Nd2 {A horrendous blunder. The correct response is 6 B-B3.} Ne4 {Pressuring the helpless Knight.} 7. Bc1 {Adding a defender. But...} Qf6 {...overlooking this devastating response. Marshall resigns at once.}
