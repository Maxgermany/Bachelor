1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 {c5 is the more popular line.} 4. e5 {Bd3 is also possible.} Nfd7 5. Bd3 {c3, f4 and Ngf3 are the other main lines.} c5 6. c3 b6 {The Botvinnik Variation, as first played by him in Leningrad (1940). His only other notable game in this line was in Moscow (1952). Both games ended in a draw. I'm sure he'd prefer to have given his name to a better line.  6. ... Nc6 is the preferred continuation.} 7. Ne2 Ba6 8. Bc2 {Bc2 is a relatively new move, first played in 1997, though never by a GM. Bxa6 is the standard response and probably better. However both players are feeling around in unknown ground and miss better moves.} cxd4 9. cxd4 Nc6 10. Nf3 Nb4 {This takes us completely out of database. Rc8 is playable but I preferred Nb4, forcing the bishop to retreat unto the already crowded back rank.} 11. Bb1 Be7 12. O-O g5 {g5 is a typically aggressive attempt to complicate the position and avoid a closed position. Rc8 was once again the quieter move and, with hindsight, the better one. All things considered, g5 is too aggressive and needs the opponent to panic to pose any real threat.} 13. h3 {And my opponent duly obliges! h3 merely makes of the h-pawn an attractive  target and invites the attack. Better options are a3, Be3 or Ne1 with the knight heading for d3. } h5 {In for a penny, in for a pound!} 14. a3 {a3 is a move too late and no longer a valid option. White must now take black's attack seriously and reply with either Nh2 or h4.} Nc6 15. Bd3 Bxd3 16. Qxd3 Rc8 {Rc8 is also too late and no longer a strategically valid move. I should have pushed on with my king-side attack and played g4.} 17. b4 {Another chance missed to play h4 or Nh2.} g4 {Better late than never....} 18. Nh2 gxh3 19. Qxh3 b5 {With Black's thrust on the king side reaping no immediate rewards I suddenly find myself desperately lacking in room to manoeuvre. I now switch to opening up the queen side to gain some much needed space.} 20. Nf3 h4 {Nb6 is playable.} 21. Be3 {White completes his development but this move was unnecessary. The king side is open for white and his pieces are amassed there, ready to attack. Nf4 was the move to make.} a5 {With the king side a dead end for my pieces I decided to open things up on the queen side. However Nb6, aiming for Nc4, looks better.} 22. bxa5 Qxa5 {Finally a chance to free my queen from her cage. Even so, Nxa5 aiming for Nc4 was probably better.} 23. Rfc1 {Thankfully my opponent is distracted by my queen side efforts and begins to worry about defending rather than attacking. Once again, and not for the last time, Nf4 or even Qg4 is better here.} Bxa3 {Pawn-snatchers' night out. Too greedy. Qa6 covering the rook on c8 and allowing Na5-c4 was the move to make. } 24. Rcb1 {White continues to ignore his attacking possibilities on the kingside. Once again Nf4! was a better move, threatening the dangerous Nxe6! However, there's even worse news for white here as he missed the chance to force a won position: 24.Ng5! Bxc1 25.Rxa5 Bxe3 26.Nxe6! Nxa5 27.Ng7  Kf8 28.Qxd7 Kxg7 29.Qg4  Kh7 30.fxe3 winning.} Qa6 {Qa6 is once again a move too late, missing the simple b4, giving me a more dangerous queen-side attack.} 25. Bd2 {A completely pointless move, merely inviting the correct push of the pawn to b4. Ng5 is once again the move to make: 25.Ng5 b4 26.Nf4.} b4 26. Nf4 {Finally! Welcome to the party! Is it too late....? It is now certainly a very interesting game. Whose flanking attack has more momentum? Let's find out...} Qc4 27. Nxe6 {Too late...? We'll have to wait and see, as this is still a potentially dangerous attack. Possibly better here however was 27.Rc1! Bxc1 28.Rxc1 Qa2 29.Nxe6 b3 30.Nc5 with an advantage.} fxe6 28. Qxe6+ Ne7 29. Ng5 {Bg5 looks better: 29.Bg5 Rh7 30.Bxe7 Rxe7 31.Qg6  Kd8 32.Qg8  Kc7 33.Qg5 Rce8 34.Rc1! Bxc1 35.Rxc1 with an advantage.} Rf8 {Preventing Qf7 .} 30. Nh7 {Throws it away! The advantage is now with black... if I can find the correct moves to survive the onslaught. The correct continuation was 30.Rxa3! bxa3 31.Bb4 Qxb4 32.Rxb4 a2 33.Ra4 Rc1  34.Kh2 a1Q 35.Rxa1 Rxa1 with a slight advantage for white. } Rf7 {Qxd4 or Rc6 were better for pushing home my advantage.} 31. Nf6+ {And so white misses a chance to lay a cunning trap: 31.Ng5! Rf5 32.Qh6 and if I reply with the tempting 32. ... Qxd4?? (instead of the correct Nf8) 33.Qh5  Kf8 34.Qh8  Ng8 35.Ne6  wins my queen and the game!} Nxf6 32. exf6 Rc6 33. Qe5 {Another poor move. Correct was 33.Qg4 Rfxf6 34.Re1 with a chance of survival. Again black had to play correctly as after 33.Qg4 Rcxf6? 34.Rxa3 Qc8 35.Qxc8  Nxc8 36.Ra8 hands the initiative back to white!} Rfxf6 {Once again 33. ... Rcxf6? is a mistake: 34.Bxb4! Bxb4 35.Rxb4! Qxb4 36.Ra8 ! Kd7 37.Ra7  Ke8 38.Ra8  and a draw by repetition.} 34. Be3 {Well the lid is on the coffin now and the final nail is not too far away. Re1 or Bg5 were the best of many ineffective options here.} Qc2 {Aiming for f5 and an active role on the king side.} 35. Rbe1 Qf5 {The nails are going in....} 36. Qb8+ {Bg5 is better, but still no help.} Kf7 37. Qb7 {Qh8 was the only way to prolong the suffering.} Rce6 {Another nail goes in as the pressure on the king intensifies.} 38. Qc7 h3 39. Qh2 {Qg3 was better.} Rxe3 {Rxe3! is by far the best move. } 40. fxe3 {The final nail... it is now certain mate in 4 moves. 40.Rxe3 Qxf2 41.Kh1 Qxe3 (winning the rook) 42.Qxh3 Rh6 (winning the queen) is game over too. } Qf2+ 41. Kh1 hxg2+ 42. Qxg2 Rh6+ {And my opponent abandoned the game in a huff in view of 43.Qh3 Rxh3 checkmate. You often find this rude behaviour on the internet. In blitz games they log out, in longer games they let the time run out, rather than resign and acknowledge their opponent with the customary 'well done' or 'good game', they perform the equivalent of getting up and leaving the room, obliging their opponent to wait shocked at the board. Let me conclude this game, which I consider one of the best all-round 'real time' games I've been fortunate enough to have played in (and don't forget, I should have lost!), by quoting the 2nd World Champion, the great Emanuel Lasker: 'When Steinitz lost the last game of the [world championship] match to me, he stood up and exclaimed: "Three hurrahs for the new world champion!" These words touched me.'}
