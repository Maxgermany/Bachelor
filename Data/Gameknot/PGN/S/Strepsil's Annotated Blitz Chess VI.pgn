1. e4 {He uses a popular opening: King's Pawn game.} e5 {I respond normally.} 2. Bc4 {He opens up his bishop, ignoring the classic theory: 'Knights before bishops'.} a6 {I push up my pawn, preparing to threaten his bishop with my b-pawn. I probably should have been getting my pieces out, but, like usual, I was trying something.} 3. a4 {I still can push up my pawn, the result would would be a swapping of pawns.: b5 4. Bd3 bxa4 5. Rxa4.} Nc6 {I open my knight.} 4. Qf3 {He opens up his queen surprisingly early, looking for 'Scholar's mate', a checkmate using the bishop to protect the queen as she takes the f-pawn. 'Scholar's mate' is one that beginners fall for. I will not.} Nf6 {I open up my knight, at the same time preventing the queen from reaching my pawn.} 5. h3 {This doesn't do anything, he should be getting his pieces out.} Bc5 {I open my bishop, and am now in a position to castle.} 6. Nc3 {He opens up his knight.} Bd4 {I threaten his knight with my bishop.} 7. Nd5 {He moves forward, threatening my knight.} d6 {I ignore the threat and prepare: Be6.} 8. c3 {He threatens my bishop.} Bc5 {I retreat.} 9. b4 {He threatens again.} Bb6 {I retreat again.} 10. a5 {Yet again, he threatens my bishop, and yet again…} Ba7 {…I retreat.} 11. b5 {He now threatens my knight, and I'm not liking my position so much.} axb5 {I take his pawn with my own.} 12. Bxb5 {And he takes mine with his bishop, he is still threatening my knight.} Bb6 {I push up my bishop, preparing to take the free pawn. If you ask why I would sacrifice my bishop, look again at the position, at both my and my opponents rooks.} 13. Bxc6+ {He takes my knight, checking the king.} bxc6 {I take his bishop with my pawn.} 14. Nxf6+ {He takes my bishop with his knight, checking me and I obviously…} gxf6 {…Take him.} 15. Ne2 {He is now in a castling position.} Rg8 {I must have forgot about the free pawn…} 16. Bb2 {He pushes up his bishop.} Bxa5 {I take the free pawn with my bishop.} 17. O-O {He castles.} Bb7 {I see something. A could pin the pawn to his queen and persuade his pawn to take one of my pieces, which would give me the queen, but how do i get to this position? I see my pawn on f6: My bait, And my pawn on c6, my barricade. Now I'm thinking further. The rook and bishop connect and collide on the g2 square.} 18. Rfd1 {He uses his rook to protect the pawn.} c5 {I go for it, trying out my plan. ^^                                           00                                            V                                            -} 19. c4 {He pushes up his pawn… :o} Qd7 {I push my queen out in case he decides to take my pawn with his queen.} 20. g4 {No matter, he is pinned to his king with my rook. But I don't see that, so I try to get rid of the pawn. } h5 {I try to get him out of the way, then I realize his g-pawn can't take me, and it can't take my pawn when I move it to f5..} 21. d3 {This move doesn't do anything, thats what i needed, a move that doesn't threat any of my pieces or get in the way of my plan.} f5 {He can take with his pawn or his queen, or he can just totally ignore it, either way, I get at least a pawn.} 22. exf5 {A very bad move, but my plan worked!} Bxf3 {I take his queen, and he resigns! :D Until I captured his pawn in move 15, I was worried, really worried. But, what a game! Thank you for reading my Sixth Annotated Blitz game!}
