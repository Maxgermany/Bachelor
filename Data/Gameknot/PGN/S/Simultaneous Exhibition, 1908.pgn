1. e4 c6 {The Caro-Kann, a relatively new defense at the time.} 2. Nc3 {Instead of setting up an ideal center with P-Q4, Lasker first develops a Knight.} d5 {Without Lasker's QP in the center, this move threatens to seize it for Black.} 3. Nf3 {Lasker keeps developing. Now if Black exchanges Pawns...} dxe4 {...which he does...} 4. Nxe4 {...Lasker has a beautifully centralized Knight.} Bf5 {Black attempts to drive Lasker's Knight from is central post.} 5.

B-Q2.} 6. h4 {Lasker plots a K-side attack.} h6 {Black creates a retreat for the B and guards against 7 N-N5.} 7. Ne5 {With N-N5 impossible, Lasker chooses this square instead.} Bh7 {The B retreats into the hidey-hole.} 8. Qh5 {Lasker focuses attention on the natural weakness at KB7.} g6 {The only defense.} 9. Bc4 {Pressuring KB7 again. Now 9... PxQ??? 10 BxP mate!} e6 {Cutting off another diagonal and creating a flight square at K2.} 10. Qe2 {With the Queen out of danger, Lasker now threatens down the K file.} Bg7 {Trying to chase the Knight. But...} 11. Nxf7 {Forking Q and R. If 11... KxN, 12 QxP ch K-B1 13 Q-B7 mate.
