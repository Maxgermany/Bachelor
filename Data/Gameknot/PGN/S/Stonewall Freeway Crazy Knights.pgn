Anusual Stonewall, the liberation of the crazy knight generates a freeway in the midd field, with white pieces placed previously than blacks there is an advantage, usual stonewall responses to a King castle in the other sight of the field, so the crazy knight doesn´t exist, is rapidly changed to avoid a fast mate. But here they found a place for their crazyness, freeway to the Knights!!!!}
