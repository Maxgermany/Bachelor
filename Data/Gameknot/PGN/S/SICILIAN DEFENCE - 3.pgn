1. e4 {Here we go.} c5 {Alright. I have played the Sicilian Defence here. This is the alternative move to e5.} 2. c4 {Usually my opponent wouldn't play this, they usually go for Bc4 and try and set up for the four move mate or King's Gambit. I will see If I can find an example for you later.} Nc6 {And now for some development (rule #2) As Black, steal the advantage from white.} 3. Nc3 {I would say from here he wants to castle King-side but too early to tell for sure yet. Best to play it cool and keep developing.} e6 {This is to stop white from advancing his Knight  to d5 and opens my Bishop and Queen.} 4. g3 {Definetly looks like he wants to castle King-side now.} Nf6 {Keep developing} 5. Bh3 {Now White has made a mistake here. His Bishop cannot go anywhere, really from this position except back to where he should have gone in the first place g2 (Rule #10 & 11). } g6 {I am going to set up for the Kings Indian Panno Variation.} 6. Nf3 {Ok Finally White has out developed me.} Bg7 {Nothing to do but continue to set up my castle.} 7. d4 {White pushes for control of the centre.} cxd4 {Let's take it and see what happens} 8. Nxd4 {Now If I take his Knight with mine it will be a straight swap with the possibility of a discovered attack on his Queen. But that means my Knight would have to move to h5 to back up the Bishop (Rule #3), bad for me. Instead I will avoid the confrontation for now and see what white plays} Ne5 {Mmmm Yummy looking pawn @c4. Notice I attack toward the side I think he is most likely going to castle on} 9. Qe2 {OK He saw the free pawn. Let's castle.} O-O {This is a strong castle as long as white castles on this side also. It can get hairy if he castles opposite and starts pushing pawns on my King-side but it is going to take a lot of moves before white can even attempt that.} 10. Bf4 {Ok I said there are some exceptions to the rules. In particular to this case Rule #3. Only as a last resort I play this next move though} Nh5 {This defends my Knight from his Bishop (Rule #5) and attacks his Bishop with my other Knight (also Rule #5)} 11. Bg4 {Ok White is getting too far ahead of himself here and I see an easy advantage if everything goes to plan.} Nxg4 {Good for me, Bad for him} 12. Qxg4 {Even Stevens} Bxd4 {Good for me, Bad for him} 13. Qf3 {Why??? I have no idea. I think Castling Queen-side was a better option for white.} Nxf4 {Good for me, Bad for him and still  3 after Qxf4} 14. Qxf4 Qa5 {White Queen four moves, my Queens first move, pinning the Knight on the King. Best move for white, castle King-side. I basically have forced him now into casling on the side that I thought he would castle on and have therefore been setting my pieces up for.} 15. Qd2 {OK so he obviously isn't the strongest player, but he is trying.} e5 {Defend the Bishop} 16. O-O {Finally he castles. and we are even in development but it is my move so I still have the advantage to attack and forcing him to defend} d6 {Opening the pathway for my bishop to chase his Rook @ f1.} 17. Kh1 {Ok this tells me he probably wants to push pawn to f4 next but my previous move was a double edged Katana. I would let him do f4xe5 then I would do d6xe5 and he would be no better off.} Bh3 {But I still have the advantage so I will chase the Rook first. Mmmm I wonder where he will go.} 18. Rfc1 {Extra protection for the Knight aye?} f5 {Let's take the initiative and split the centre open.} 19. Qh6 {Ok I can deal with that. White only has one attack (my Bishop).} Bg4 {Defend} 20. a3 {Ok White has pushed his pawn to a3. This tells me he wants to back off my Queen but at this stage I already have forseen the end.} Bxf2 {Eliminate the obstruction.} 21. b4 {Oh how I do love the Queen sacrifice, but I will give my opponent one last opportunity to see his demise.} Bd4 {Let's see if he is too greedy to notice. (A stronger opponent offering a free piece, especially a Queen, Look closely for the reason)} 22. bxa5 Bf3# {In all White moved Queen 6 times to my once. Do you see a pattern developing here?}
