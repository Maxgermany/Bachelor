Bxf6 {Now I'll gladly go in for piece exchanges.} Bxf6 21. Rac1 Rg5+ 22. Kf1 {Best to move towards the center. No reason to have my King trapped on the KR file.} Be5 23. f4 Rh5 24. fxe5 {The Pawn fork wins another piece, but Black doesn't give up.} Rxh2 25. Nd6 Rb8 26.

If my last pawn falls...} Kg7 37. Nf5+ Kf7 38. Nd6+ {Trying to conserve my last pawn.} Ke6 39. Nc4 b5 40. Rca1 {I offer a Rook trade, which Black, to my surprise, promptly takes.} Rxa1 41. Rxa1 bxc4 42. Bxc4+ {The problem with this move is my last pawn will now fall.} Kxe5 43. Rxa5+ Kd6 44. Kd4 {With R and B against R, without pawns, it will be difficult to win.} Kc7 45. Ra6 Kb7 46. Kc5 {I push on with my King.} Rc8+ 47. Kb4 Rxc4+ 48. Kxc4 Kxa6 {In the original rules of chess, my 48th move would have given me the win with Black down to Bare King. But with the current rules, the position is a draw.}
