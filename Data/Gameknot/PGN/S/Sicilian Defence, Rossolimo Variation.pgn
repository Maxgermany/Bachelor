1. e4 {This is a game I played against Shredder a few weeks ago.  Although White didn't play very well and dropped his queen to a fairly obvious tactic, one of the nice things about the game is that it shows the danger of not developing your pieces and of launching unsupported attacks.  White was able to pull off the victory because Black ended up with all his pieces sidelined, either having not moved or having moved away from the scene of the fight.} c5 {The Sicilian Defence.  The most popular choice for Black against 1. e4, and something that offers good chances for Black, especially against weaker players who don't know quite what to do.  I didn't used to like playing against it, but I'm improving.} 2. Nf3 {A general developing move that doesn't commit White to anything in particular yet.} Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Bb5 {Shredder (and thus the game title) lists this as the Rossolimo Variation, with White taking an almost Ruy Lopez-inspired approach.  However, we should note that the Rossolimo proper has Bb5 as White's third move and Black replying with 3. ... g6 (neither of which are the case here).  We can probably consider this a transposed move order for White and a deviation from book for Black's next move.} Nf6 {Combines general development with an attack on the e4 pawn (which will need further support before it can come to anything).} 5. d4 Be6 6. Be3 {As Black has not pursued his attack on e4, White is free to try an attack of his own at d5.} cxd4 7. Nxd4 {Of course, Black cannot reply 7. ... Nxd4 because that would put the king in check from the bishop.} Bd7 8. Nd5 {Exchanging the knights would allow exd5 with an attack on the knight.  White could also have castled for stronger defence, or perhaps played Qe2.} Nxd5 9. exd5 Ne5 10. c4 {Supporting the threatened bishop, but also cutting off its lines of retreat. An exchange is the best White can expect if Black tries to pursue it.} Bxb5 {Black opts for an immediate exchange of the bishops.} 11. Nxb5 {White is happy with this knight placement, with one eye on a hopeful Nc7 if the queen moves before castling.  Black could play a6 to drive the knight back, but it wouldn't help his position much otherwise, and he might instead consider e5 (especially as White's lack of an lsb offsets the weakeness in his castle created by exchanging pawns on e6.  Black could also try Nxc4 as the pawn is no longer defended.} Qa5+ {Instead Black develops the queen with check.  Without the c4 pawn, this would have been an excellent attack, and could have been usefully preceded by Nxc4.} 12. Bd2 Qb6 13. Qa4 {White still eyes c7, using the discovered check to pick up the rook.} Nd3+ {Black applies a check of his own.} 14. Kd1 {?? Ke2 was probably best, although Black can still play Nxb2 to some effect.} Nxb2+ 15. Ke2 {White chooses to allow his rooks to connect and to move his king away from the fight on the queenside.} Nxa4 16. Rab1 {White now needs good activity if he is to compensate for the loss of material.  It's fair to say that this should be over if Black gets his pieces together.} e5 {Attempting to activate the centre and the dsb.  g6 might have been better.} 17. Rb4 {Attacks the knight and allows the rooks to be doubled.  Note that White passes on 17. dxe5 e.p. because the d5 pawn is blocking the d6 pawn, which is itself blocking the black dsb.} Nc5 {The only available retreat.} 18. Be3 {Pinning the knight, although it is well defended and cannot yet be taken.} Qa5 19. Rhb1 {White could have defended both the a2 pawn and the b4 rook by playing a3.  However, this would have resulted in a cramped, inflexible defence that would probably have given Black a lot of time to get more active, and would have been vulnerable to a6 in particular.  White will lose a little more material, but one pawn is hardly likely to make a difference now - it's activity White needs, not minor material.} Qxa2+ 20. Rb1b2 {Qxb2 Rxb2 now would be favourable for White.} Qa1 {Black has his eye on the kingside pawns, but the cost is a temporarily useless queen, who can't do anything else from the back rank.  We should note that Black has greatly limited activity - three of his pieces haven't moved, one is in imminent danger and one, the queen, is a little out of the action.} 21. Nc7+ {After a lot of time eyeing that square, White finally moves to pick up the rook and is close to crippling Black's queenside.} Kd7 22. Nxa8 Qh1 {? Black has now moved to pick up the h-pawn, but is in trouble since his queenside is both a near-wasteland and is under heavy attack.  Be7 is better - it picks up the knight and gets the h-rook out and fighting.} 23. Bxc5 {White removes Black's last defender on the queenside.} dxc5 {Black's best choice - Be7 gets him mated and nothing else recovers the material.} 24. Rb4xb7+ {Black can escape this fight alive thanks to the time bought by White needing to capture the a7 pawn, but will need to be a little careful.} Kd6 {Black's other options: A: 24. ... Kc8 25. Rb8+ Kd7 26. R2b7+ Kd6 Rd8# B: 24. ... Kd8 25. Rb8+ Ke7 and Black escapes the mate threat. C: 24. ... Ke8 25. Nc7+ and Black again escapes.  Kd6 still allows Black to get out if he plays the right move (e4).} 25. Rxa7 {White now threatens mate in one, to which Black must respond.} Qxg2 {But he does not.  It's odd that the computer overlooks a mate in one, but syptomatic of its problems in the game overall - not enough activity and development.  Of course, it's also a result of the low difficulty setting.} 26. Rb6# {}
