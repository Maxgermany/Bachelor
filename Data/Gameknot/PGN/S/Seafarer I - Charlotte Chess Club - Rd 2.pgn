1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Qxd4 {Nxd4 is more common, however the Qxd4 is not a bad move. According to the GameKnot game database both have the same win percentage although the knight take is played 40 times as much.} Nc6 5. Qc4 {This is a bad position for the queen to be moved to.  It allows black to develop his WSB and forces the queen to be moved again.  One of the goals of an opening is to develop your pieces without moving the same one multiple times.  Here the queen has already moved twice and will be forced to move a third.  White would have been better with Bb5, both developing another piece and pinning the knight.} Be6 6. Qa4 a6 7. c4 {Here white prevents the b5 move which will again force white to move the queen.} Qa5+ 8. Qxa5 {White sees the opportunity to exchange queens which he takes.  However, a better move might have been Nc3.  This gives black the option of exchanging the queens however the advantage to white will be the placement of the knight as he will be able to develop another piece and prevent black from gaining the double attack on the c pawn with Nxa5 at the end of the queen exchange.} Nxa5 9. b3 Nc6 10. Nc3 {With Nc3, white allows black to place his knight on b4 which will become a major headache.  White would have been better with a3 which protects this square and still allows Nc3 on whites next move.  } Nb4 11. Nd4 {White wishes to keep his opportunity to castle so Nd4 is the only real option to prevent the king rook fork on c2.  However, it will be difficult for white to protect these pieces if black is able to get his bishop to g7.} g6 12. Nce2 Bg7 {With this move, white is seeing great pressure on the diagonal and the knight has a number of strong combinations.} 13. Ba3 {I am hard pressed to find a good move for white in this position.  Ba3 plays badly (as do any other BSB move) as we will see.  a3 results with ND3  Ke2 then NXf2.  White must leave his knights where they are.  g3 might be an option but we will have the results as with the bishop move.} Nd3+ 14. Kd2 Nxf2 15. Rg1 Nxe4+ 16. Ke1 Bd7 17. Rd1 Be5 18. g3 Nh6 19. Bg2 Nf6 20. Bxb7 Ra7 21. Bf3 g5 {It is unclear what black attempts to accomplish with this pawn push.  I believe that black has three better options.    1.  0-0 which places his king in a strong position and allows him to bring both rooks to attach the open queen side.    2.  Ng4 with an attempt to place his knight on e3.  This will bring even more pressure on the white king and rooks.    3.  Bg4 which could force a bishop trade.  White can move his bishop to prevent the trade but I think the black position would be stronger than with the g5 move.} 22. Bc1 {The pawn push now loses black a piece.} g4 23. Bxh6 {White decides to trade his bishop for the knight and the pawn.  This also isolates the black h pawn which could play vital in the end game if white can trade down some of the other major pieces.} gxf3 24. Nxf3 Ng4 25. Bc1 Bf6 26. h3 Ne5 27. Nxe5 Bxe5 28. Nf4 Bxf4 29. gxf4 Bxh3 30. Rh1 Bg4 31. Rd5 {White blunders with this move.  He misses the Bf3 fork which forces him to trade down a rook for a bishop which setups a very difficult end game.} Bf3 32. Rdh5 Bxh1 33. Rxh1 Ra8 34. Bb2 f6 35. f5 Kf7 36. Bd4 h5 37. Ke2 h4 38. Rh3 Rag8 39. Bf2 Rg2 40. Kf3 Rg5 41. Kf4 Rg2 42. Kf3 Rg5 43. Kf4 Rhh5 44. Bxh4 Rgxf5+ 45. Kg4 Kg6 46. Be1 Rfg5+ 47. Kf4 Rxh3 {White Resigns}
