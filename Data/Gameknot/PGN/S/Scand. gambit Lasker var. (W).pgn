1. e4 d5 2. exd5 c6 3. dxc6 Nxc6 4. Nf3 e5 5. Bb5 Nge7 {Mistake (Black oversaw the next move)} 6. Nxe5 Qd5 {Black has now two pawns less but four pieces out and the initiative. The mistake was, maybe, not so serious.} 7. Bxc6+ {Only way not to lose a piece} Nxc6 8. Nf3 Bg4 {Developping and pining the only piece white has out} 9. Nc3 Qh5 {It's a risky move.} 10. d4 Bb4 {Black hesitated to castle long which would give a quick and mighty attack but a very weak king. I finally opted for developping. Black pieces are separated but everybody is protected and they cover quite a big amount of squares.} 11. Be3 O-O {Now, the center is the next objective} 12. a3 Bxc3+ {But black has to defend. I hesitated again to trade for, if  it gives white a double pawn which compensate a bit the two pawns advance, it opens the b file. } 13. bxc3 Rfe8 {Central open file. The place to be.} 14. h3 Bd7 {Mistake, castle would have been better. Another hesitation but with two pawns late, black didn't dare to trade bishop and queen for a second double pawn. (with bishop alone, I might have try this line because white's pawn structure would have been far inferior. further more I begin to have a plan to attack c2 and c3.} 15. g4 {Mistake, white oversaw the next move.} Qa5 16. Qd3 {Mistake} Qd5 17. Ke2 {Mistake, Black has now a winning sequency} Na5 {If I'm right, white .loses at least a knight and gets a very bad position.} 18. Ne5 {Mistake, to avoid losing a knight, white loses far more.} Bb5 19. c4 {The most natural move. Anyway white has little choice.} Nxc4 {Better than Bxc4} 20. Qc3 {Only way to save the lady} Nxe5+ 21. Kd2 Nc4+ {Better than Nf3 because the knight would have blocked the black queen. White can do nothing anyway, he is mate in a couple of moves.}
