1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. e3 Bd6 7. Bd3 Be6 {In the QGD exchange, black usually goes for ...Be7 and ...Nbd7 first. } 8. Qc2 h6 9. Bh4 Nbd7 {Standard development so far, with the exception that black has placed his dark-squared bishop on a more aggressive square, d6. But then the pin is more annoying. } 10. Nge2 O-O {Normal development so far, hence the scarce notes. } 11. Bg3 {11. O-O?? would be a bad mistake. If your Gameknot rating is below 1500, try to figure out why 11. O-O would be a blunder. } Nb6 {If 11. O-O?, then 11...Bxh2+! 12. Kxh2 Ng4+ followed by ...Qxh4.  This knight often comes into c4 after white plays b4. } 12. O-O Rc8 13. Rfc1 Re8 14. Na4 {Now black must trade off the knight or I will play Nc5. } Bxg3 15. Nxg3 Nxa4 16. Qxa4 Qb6 {The a pawn is a bit of a problem for black, now his queen gets somewhat out of play. } 17. b4 {Standard queenside expansion in this pawn structure. } Bd7 {Black threatens to play ...c5 getting rid of his c pawn problem. } 18. Qb3 {This prevents ...c5 and prepares an eventual a4. } Rc7 {Black's rook and queen are out of play after this move. } 19. Rab1 Be6 {As I build for b4-b5, Black just shuffles his pieces with no plan. } 20. Ne2 {I need to get my knight back into the game. The best plan would be Ng3-e2-c3-a4-c5 } Ne4 21. Rc2 Bf5 22. Nc3 {This forces off the bishops, and I like my bishop better, but I felt it was worth it to trade off knights. } Nxc3 23. Qxc3 Bxd3 24. Qxd3 a6 25. a4 {The minority attack starts to roll. } Re6 26. Rcb2 Re8 27. Qb3 Rd8 28. h3 {Do not rush when your opponent has no counterplay. } g6 29. Rc2 Rdd7 30. Rc5 {This is a very good square for the rook. It attacks d5, can move along the 5th rank, and can pressure the c pawn later. } Qa7 31. b5 {Standard break move. } cxb5 32. axb5 {I should have played Rxc7; in fact, that was what I had in mind, but my hand move the wrong move. When I realized it, I had already captured the black awn. } Rxc5 33. b6 {! intermezzo avoids losing pawn } Qb8 34. dxc5 Qc8 35. Qc3 {The next few moves were in time rush, so don't pay too much attention to the accuracy. } Qc6 36. Rd1 Kh7 37. Qd2 {e4 is threatened. } f5 38. f3 Qe6 39. Rc1 {I prepare e4. } Qc6 40. Rf1 Qe6 41. Re1 Re7 42. Qd4 Rf7 43. Rd1 Rf8 44. e4 {! the winning sacrifice. My opponent has 11 seconds on his clock. } fxe4 45. fxe4 dxe4 46. Qd7+ Qf7 {Forced, or else I win the b pawn and the game. } 47. c6 {I get a passed pawn. } bxc6 48. b7 Kg8 49. Qxf7+ {Now I have  winning tactic. } Kxf7 50. Rf1+ Kg7 51. Rxf8 Kxf8 52. b8=Q+ {}
