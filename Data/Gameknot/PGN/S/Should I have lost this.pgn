1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 {The King's Indian Defence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defence} d6 5. f3 {I play the Sämisch Variation. It is named after Friedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s. This often leads to very sharp play with the players castling on opposite wings and attacking each other's kings. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defence#S.C3.A4misch_Variation:_5.f3} O-O 6. Be3 e5 7. d5 c6 8. Bd3 Nbd7 {This is all commonly seen. I now come up with a move which is questionable. Correct is Nge2 or Qd2.} 9. Bc2 {I am threatening to take on c6 followed by d6.} Nb6 {He meets this threat, with his own threat to c4} 10. Qd3 {Not a good square to put my queen!} c5 {Closing up the centre.} 11. Nge2 {I develop} Nh5 {He prepares f7-f5} 12. g4 {I hit his knight. I was quite expecting a pawn sac now, Nf4 and after 13. Nxf4, exf4 14. Bxf4 he has compensation for the pawn.} Nf6 {This just wastes time. I felt confident with my position again.} 13. Ng3 {Preparing kingside attack} a6 {While he prepares ....b7-b5} 14. O-O-O {I finally commit my king.} Bd7 {Further preparations for b7-b5} 15. Rdg1 {While I mobilise on my Eastern Front..... (the kingside!). The blocked pawn centre does rather divide the board into 2 halves.} Nc8 {So he makes the final preparation for b7-b5} 16. Qd2 {Now that he has removed the attack on c4, I can mobilise my queen.} b5 {So he starts his queenside push} 17. Bh6 {And I just ignore the attack on c4 and just get on with my attack} Nb6 {Rather than take, he moves his knight forward again.} 18. Nf5 {and I throw the knight in. Of course he dares not take the knight with his g pawn, I simply take back with my g pawn and there is disaster down the g file. But I am giving up the pawn on c4, and the question is - is this pawn sac sound? Although I won, maybe it not sound. What do you think dear reader?} Nxc4 {So he takes, attacking my queen.} 19. Qg5 {I want to stay on my bishop so that I can reply to Bxh6 with Qxh6. For instance 19. Qg2? Bxh6+ 20. Nxh6 Kg7 and white's attack seems to be grinding to a halt.} Bxf5 {He virtually has to take this way.} 20. gxf5 {I open the g file.} Nh5 {OK stop and find white's next move!} 21. Qxh5 {Did you get this?} gxh5 {OK, what did white play next?} 22. Bxg7 {Did you find this? Rxg7 instead wins for Black!} Qd7 {And now White plays?} 23. Bf6# {Bxe5 is mate too. So it was great to go back to the top of the "Player of the Season" for Division 2 of the Chester & District Chess League. http://cdchessleague.org.uk/players.php?comp=Division+2 But the question remains. Was my pawn sac sound? What if instead of Nh5? which loses for him (in the best lines he is bishop for pawn down in the ending, maybe instead he should play Ne8. Then what? Maybe someone would set this up on a computer for me, and see its evaluation of the position? Anyway, many thanks for reading, please rank this annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two! Until next time dear reader!}
