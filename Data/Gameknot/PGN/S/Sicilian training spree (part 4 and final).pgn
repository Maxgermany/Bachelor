1. e4 c5 2. f4 d6 {way too early, to make a decision like this: one of the tricks in the Sicilian is to not cover c5; d6, is usually played after e4, c5, Nc3, d6...} 3. Nf3 a6 4. c3 b5 {true to the Sicilian, Black starts to conquer the Queens' wing...} 5. g3 Nf6 6. d3 Bb7 7. Bg2 Nc6 8. Be3 Qb6 {not too accurate: maybe better Ng4 first...} 9. O-O O-O-O {you do not see this often: Black castling long, in the Sicilian; but why not?} 10. h3 {take out Ng4...} g6 {clever, but a bit late...} 11. Nbd2 Bg7 12. Qc2 {both players have completed development: White - as always - has reached a Grand Prix Attack setup; Blacks' position is solid, but there still has a lot of work to be done...} h6 {avoiding Ng5...} 13. g4 {relentless...} e6 {preparing d5: a direct d5, would fail on e5; this is not much better...} 14. Bf2 g5 15. e5 {time to break some tensions...} dxe5 16. fxe5 Nd5 17. Bg3 {avoiding Nf4...} c4+ 18. d4 Ne3 {these are the breaks...} 19. Qe4 Nxf1 20. Nxf1 Nb4 21. Qe2 Bd5 22. Ne3 f6 23. exf6 Bxf6 24. Nxd5 Nxd5 25. Ne5 {the move, White was waiting for: now, Nf7 is a very unwelcome move...} Bxe5 26. Bxe5 Rh7 27. Bxd5 Rxd5 {building, on the pin over d4: but that will not hold long...} 28. Rf1 {here is a problem...} Rd8 29. Qe4 Rhd7 30. Rf6 Rd7d5 31. Rxh6 Rxe5 32. Qxe5 {a clear miscalculation from Black: he was loosely counting on Qa8+, Kd7, Rh7+, Kd6, Qf3, Re1+, Kf2, Rb1, Qg3+, Kd5, Qe5+, Kc6, Qxe6+, Rd6, and Whites' attack will not hold with a piece behind...} Rd5 {Black is still building on the pin over d4: and at least, he is saving g5...} 33. Rh8+ Kd7 {a tough decision: after Rd8, Rxd8+, Black has made no progress...} 34. Qg7+ Kc6 35. Rc8+ Kd6 36. Qf8+ Kd7 37. Rd8+ Kc6 38. Rxd5 exd5 39. Qf6+ Kc7 40. Qxg5 Qe6 {just about the only move for Black...} 41. Kf2 {the winning move: from now on, White will try and trade Queens - for instance: Qf7+, Qf5; after that, the free pawns on the Kings' wing are decisive: so Black resigned...}
