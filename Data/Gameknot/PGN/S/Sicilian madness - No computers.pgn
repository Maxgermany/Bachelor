1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e5 {This move is usual, but i dont like. I dont know why i did it (it could be due to the gameknot opening book)} 7. Nb3 Be7 8. O-O b5 {I didnt know this move was an error} 9. a4 b4 10. Nd5 Nc6 11. Nxf6+ Bxf6 12. Be3 Be6 13. Qd3 O-O 14. Rfd1 Qe7 {I thought "I will lost a pawn but it doesnt matter, because that pawn is a burden (i dont know if itÂ´s the correct translation for 'lastre'). I prefer to open the d-column for a counterattack in the queen side (if i could do it)"} 15. Qxd6 Nd4 16. Rxd4 {why is this move correct?. For me was an error} exd4 17. Qxe7 Bxe7 18. Nxd4 {Ok, we both have same value of pieces, but for me i have more value because i had lost a pawn anyway} Bd7 19. Bc4 {now i have other plan:change pieces and keep my rook (more powerful than a bishop or knight) for the end of the game} Bf6 20. b3 Rfd8 21. Rd1 Be6 22. Be2 Bxd4 {strong knight out} 23. Rxd4 Rxd4 {white with no rooks and open column, i thought at that moment i had advantage} 24. Bxd4 Rc8 {one pawn you, one pawn me} 25. Bd3 Bxb3 {obvious, with less pieces, i have advantage for the power of my rook (as I said)} 26. cxb3 Rd8 27. Bxa6 Rxd4 {same value, but my rook have the power} 28. f3 Rd2 {and the king is prisoner } 29. Bc4 Rc2 30. Bd5 g5 {for keep the white king with less room} 31. h3 Kg7 {the king is in the battle} 32. Kh2 h5 33. h4 {this was an error. } gxh4 34. Kh3 Kg6 35. f4 f6 36. Be6 Rf2 {and the rook is better than the bishop} 37. f5+ Kg5 38. Bd7 Re2 {other pawn is mine :-)} 39. Be6 Rxe4 40. a5 {this move has no hope...} Re1 41. Kh2 Ra1 {another one... :-)} 42. a6 Rxa6 {here the game was over for me} 43. Kg1 Ra2 44. Kf1 Kg4 {and the way for h-pawn (or even f-pawn) is almost clear I think i didnt win this game but minuchin lost it}
