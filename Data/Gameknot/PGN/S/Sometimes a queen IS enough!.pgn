1. e4 {This was an unrated game,  where I deliberately let my opponent have an extra queen early on. I do manage to gradually get back into the game, and reach an ending where I have three connected extra pawn, two of them passed pawns, which more or less balance out her extra rook. But then I misplay it horribly, and I get mated!} e5 {So we start conventionally enough.} 2. Nc3 {I develop my knight.} Nf6 {So does she!} 3. Qh5 {and I give away my queen!} Nxh5 {She takes.} 4. Bc4 {I develop.} Nc6 {So does she.} 5. d3 {I open a line for my other bishop.} Bb4 {I'm not happy here. I was afraid she would swap her bishop of my knight.} 6. Nge2 {So I make sure that at least my pawns are not doubled.} O-O {She castles} 7. O-O {So do I. I think her best move now is to exchange on c3. When materially ahead, exchange pieces, but not pawns, as a general rule of thumb.} d6 {But she develops instead.} 8. Nd5 {So I move my knight.} a6 {I'm not quite sure of the reason for this move.} 9. c3 {I hit her bishop} Bc5 {She retreats} 10. b4 {I hit it again.} Bb6 {She retreats again.} 11. h3 {I wanted to stop her playing Bc8-g4} Ne7 {She challenges my knight.} 12. Bg5 {I pin her knight. She has to lose material now.} Nf6 {And she loses it this way.} 13. Nxf6+ {So I take her knight} gxf6 {She takes back} 14. Bxf6 {and the pin on her knight is resumed. I do actually have a plan here - to move my king, play f2-f4 and maybe Rf1-f3-g3} Qd7 {So she breaks the pin.} 15. Kh2 {I start my plan.} Ng6 {But now her knight is free to come out.} 16. f4 {I carry on with my plan regardless. She should have exchanged in f4 now.} Re8 {she gives extra protection to e5 and maybe creates a flight square for her king and/or knight.} 17. f5 {So I hit her knight} Nh8 {She retreats. This is given as a mistake by Post Match Computer Analysis, which suggests d5 18. Bxd5 Nf4 19. Nxf4 exf4 20. Bg5 Be3 21. a4 Qd6 22. Kh1 Ra7 23. Bc4 a5 24. Rfb1 axb4 25. cxb4 Bd7. Certainly on h8 the knight doesn't seem to have very good prospects.} 18. Rf3 {So I carry on with my plan.} Kf8 {Her king flies, but this move has a drawback... } 19. Bxh8 {Namely it loses a knight!} Ke7 {But her king reaches relative safety.} 20. Bg7 {My bishop was attacked by her rook.} f6 {PMCA says this is a mistake and suggests c6 21. Ng3 d5 22. Bb3 Qd6 23. Nh5 Rg8 24. exd5 e4+ 25. Rg3 Bf2 26. f6+ Ke8 27. dxe4 Bxg3+ 28. Nxg3 Qf4 29. dxc6 bxc6} 21. g4 {This is also a mistake. The position cries out for Ne2-g3-h5, but my plan involves trying to break open the centre.} c6 {She is preparing d6-d5.} 22. d4 {This is given as a mistake too, but trying to break open the center seemed best at the time.} d5 {This move is not given as a mistake by PMCA, but I think it may be. I would have thought black shouldn't help with the opening of the center.} 23. exd5 {So I take.} cxd5 {She takes back. I had dreams of a2-a4-a5 followed by Bb3-a4 and/or c3-c4 further opening the center.} 24. Bb3 {I retreat my attacked bishop.  I had dreams of a2-a4-a5 followed by Bb3-a4 and/or c3-c4 further opening the center.} Rg8 {This is a mistake. e5-e4 closes the center again, and she has chances of attack with Cb6-c7 and/or Qd7-d6.} 25. Bh6 {I retreat my bishop.} Qe8 {e5-e4 was still better. Putting the queen and king on the same file can have drawbacks, as we shall see.} 26. Bxd5 {Not to mention the fact that the queen was protecting d5.} Rf8 {I'm not sure of the reason for this move. he rook is still attacked on this square.} 27. Re1 {But I have another plan, to play Ne2-f4 and burst through the e file.} Kd6 {PMCA gives this as a mistake and suggests  Qb5 28. Bb3 Bc7 29. Ng3 Bd7 30. Bxf8+ Rxf8 31. d5 Qb6 32. Ne4 h6 33. a4 Bd6 34. a5 Qb5} 28. Nf4 {So I carry on with my plan. I didn't really expect her to give up queen for knight and rook.} exf4 {But she does.} 29. Rxe8 {So I take the rook.} Rxe8 {She takes back} 30. Bc4 {I retreat my attacked bishop.} Bc7 {Not sure of the reason for this move. Her f4 pawn is doomed anyway.} 31. Bxf4+ {So I take.} Kd7 {King moves.} 32. Be6+ {I throw in a check.} Kd8 {King retreats.} 33. d5 {So I have three pawns for a rook, I have nearly equalized.} Bxe6 {She takes} 34. fxe6 {I take back.} Bxf4+ {She trades bishops.} 35. Rxf4 {I take.} Ke7 {She protects f6.} 36. c4 {I secure my pawn center.} b6 {PMCA suggests Kd6 37. Rf5 b6 38. Rxf6 b5 39. e7+ Kxe7 40. Re6+ Kd7 41. Rxe8 Rxe8 42. c5 Re5 43. d6 Re2+ 44. Kg3 Rxa2 45. Kf4 Rd2 instead, but I don't think it makes much difference.} 37. Kg3 {I advance my king.} Rad8 {She finally mobilizes her last rook. } 38. Kf3 {PMCA says this is a "mistake" and says 38. Rd4 Kf8 39. Rf4 b5 40. Rxf6+ Ke7 41. Rf7+ Kd6 42. Kf4 bxc4 43. Ke4 Re7 44. Rf3 Rb8 45. a3 Rc8 46. Rc3 h6 47. h4 is better, but this can't be right. Centralizing the king must be ok, and I can't understand why in this line, black just gives up the f pawn? } h6 {This is also given as a mistake and PMCA suggests b5 39. cxb5 Rxd5 40. bxa6 Ra8 41. a4 Rxa6 42. b5 Rxe6 43. h4 Rd3+ 44. Kf2 Rh3 45. h5 Rh2+ 46. Kf3 Ra2 47. Rc4 Kd6 48. Rc6+ Kd5} 39. Ke4 {So I continue to mobiloze my king.} Reg8 {I'm not sure of the reason for this move.} 40. Kf5 {This is a great mistake, my king is needed in the center and on the queen side.} a5 {She starts to break up my pawn formation.} 41. a3 {I try to hold the line.} axb4 {She takes.} 42. axb4 {I take back.} b5 {I am in real trouble now! She has played the last few moves really well.} 43. Rd4 {I am losing a pawn - and the game!} bxc4 {She takes} 44. Rxc4 {I take.} Rxd5+ {She takes again} 45. Ke4 {my king comes back} Kxe6 {and another pawn goes.} 46. Rc6+ {May as well try this} Rd6 {But she finds the best reply.} 47. Rc5 {I avoid the rook exchange.} Rb6 {She goes after the pawn} 48. b5 {I advance it.} Ra8 {Her other rook comes round to join in.} 49. Rh5 {I go after her h pawn.} Ra4+ {She throws in a check.} 50. Kf3 {I retreat.} Rb4 {She gangs up on my b pawn.} 51. Rxh6 {So I take her h pawn.} Rb6xb5 {and my b pawn goes. I did have dreams of hiding my king on h4 here, but she can just line up both rooks on the 3rd rank and win my h pawn, so I decided to push it. It probably hastened my defeat, but the position is pretty hopeless now anyway. } 52. h4 {So I push my passed pawn.} Ra5 {She now has a simple mating pattern. No need to further comment.} 53. Ke3 Ra3+ 54. Kd2 Rb2+ 55. Kc1 Rg2 56. Kb1 Rh3 {Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate this annotation on the star system.}
