1. e4 {Round 1 of 4 in Skokie, IL.  I'm playing white.} e5 2. Nf3 {Hoping for Nc6 3.d4 with a scotch.} Nf6 {The Russian Defense.} 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 {d3 and Nc3 are more trying in attempts for an edge for white.} d5 6. Be2 {Passive. Intimidated by my higher rated opponent I play as if I had the black pieces and turtle uncomfortably.  I do not know much theory in these lines, though it should be obvious that Bd3 is far superior. I think it was even clear then, but I selected this anyway.} Bd6 7. O-O O-O 8. c3 {c4 was perhaps better to undermine the support of the annoying e4 knight.} c6 9. Nbd2 Bf5 10. Re1 {A defensive idea to get the d knight on f1.  It also improve the rook} Qc7 11. Nf1 Nd7 12. Bd3 Rfe8 {I thought Rae8 was better in view of my idea.} 13. Nh4 {Grabbing the bishop pair at the right moment.  This is possible because of the f1 knight holding h2.  If Be6 then Bxe4 clips a central pawn and a large advantage.  In light of this, Bg6 is forced.} Bg6 14. Nxg6 hxg6 {If the Re8 was on f8 still then fg was interesting to apply pressure down the f file.} 15. c4 Nef6 16. Be3 dxc4 17. Bxc4 {An IQP position, where white has the bishop pair.  Black will be stealing some tempi though so it is not so simple.} Nb6 18. Bb3 {Controlling the square in front of the IQP.  This move also maintains the pin on f7.  black should hope to blockade the IQP with a knight, as this is standard play on the iqp.} Nbd5 19. Rc1 Nxe3 20. fxe3 {Opposite color bishops in the middglegame.  White has hanging central pawns.  There are unique imbalances in this position that should lead for a perhaps decisive game, if not an interesting one at this point.} Qd7 {The queen comes aims at f5} 21. Qf3 Rad8 22. Rcd1 Qf5 23. Ng3 Qxf3 24. gxf3 {I thought this position was good for white.  It is complicated, however.} Bc7 25. Kf2 Bb6 26. Ne2 Re7 27. Nf4 Kf8 28. Nd3 Bc7 29. Nc5 Bb8 30. Na4 Nh5 31. Kg2 Rde8 32. e4 g5 33.
