1. a4 {Chess openings is a nice way to take you to the middle game...it has nothing to do with your own creativity! Its a salute to great chessmasters!} g6 2. d3 Bg7 3. d4 Nc6 4. e3 d5 5. Bd2 Nf6 {I have noticed that my toughest games was the ones that took this shape} 6. h3 {I put that pawn there jst to develop my pieces peacefully} O-O 7. Bd3 Ne4 8. Nf3 a6 9. Qe2 e5 10. c3 {I know that his night wouldnt backoff...if he did, he would have wasted a move...so that bishop of mine will be lost...therefore I keep my night at b1 to replace the bishop and to keep some strength on the middle} exd4 11. cxd4 Be6 12. O-O Qd7 13. Nh2 Nxd2 14. Nxd2 Nb4 15. Ra3 {He want that otha bishop...but it is the nights that you need to penetrate the middle-game...sacrificing both, mean that you will do a nights work with a bishop.} Nxd3 16. Qxd3 {my rook is protecting a4...} Bf5 17. Qb3 {...let him attack open spaces...dnt push pawns unless there a good reason...If I pushed e3 to e4...then his rooks would take over that file...Without nights he cannot attack me from behind my own ranks} c6 18. f3 {this move was a little risky, I had to do something...} Rfe8 19. Raa1 Qe7 {I was a little colorblind with that move, thinking that his bishop would take my rook at a3} 20. e4 dxe4 21. fxe4 {that f file is mine...} Bxd4+ {I would lie if i wasnt worried...} 22. Kh1 Be6 23. Qc2 {I cnt say that this is my favourate position, and I wnt recomend it, but my mind brought me to this situation, and will have to find a way out.} Rad8 {Now he is taking over....} 24. Ra3 {I want that rank.} Be5 {look at that!} 25. Ndf3 Bxh2 26. Kxh2 Rd6 27. Qc5 {This was a despirate move _  pin his authority in one blow!} Qc7 28. Qe5 {and again!} Qd7 29. Qg5 { a simple attack, could hold off his attack} Qc7 {nice...} 30. e5 {gud for that} Rd5 31. Re3 {support} Rf8 {I think he wanted to push f6} 32. Qh6 {a simple attack!} Bf5 {so simple that he underestimated its power} 33. Ng5 f6 {too late!} 34. Rxf5 {There is no value than mate itself!} gxf5 35. Ne6 {a fork} Qf7 36. Rg3+ Kh8 {this move I like} 37. Rg7 {a dubious sword!} Qxg7 38. Qxg7# {Its ok.}
