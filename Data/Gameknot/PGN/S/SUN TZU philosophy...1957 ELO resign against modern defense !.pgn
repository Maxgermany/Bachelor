1. d4 g6 {modern defense 1} 2. c4 Bg7 {modern defense 2} 3. Nf3 c5 {modern defense 3 ! and that's all. Then every thing can happen} 4. e3 {i m not used with this. So let's see what happens if i take d4 ...} cxd4 5. exd4 {ok, that leave the center empty, it doesnt cancel the pressure on d4 and the white ing is quite discovered. By the way, there is no more risk for a f6 knight position so ...} Nf6 6. Nc3 {i'm missing developpement, but we can see that after, rembering the good advice "when play black, prioritize security !" (does somebody rember who is this advice ??)} O-O {so let's castle } 7. Bd3 {i dont see any threat with this, should be just in oreder to castle. So i have a free tempo to devlop} a6 {but first i whant to repulse the queen-side 's wite center occupation whith b7 b5. It is not very good but i dont know what to do ...will it be the bigining of the end for blacks ? Maybe..., maybe not !} 8. O-O {i still have a tempo !} d6 {in order to pin the f3 knight. My plan is this : Brcause anyway i know that i will die, i whant to have some fun playing more agressvely, so i diced to intent a bishop sacrifice 9. ...Bd2  10....Qc1   11...Bg4   12.h2/h3 g4xh3 13.g2xh3  Qxh3!   Of course this is too long to prepare and to easy to anticipate for such a good player like my oponent. But it will be fun anyway ! remenber that this is just a blitz .} 9. Re1 {for themoment i dont care about this rook} Bd7 {plan n°1 ...} 10. d5 {no direct threat, i dont care !} Qc8 {plan n°2 ... (oponent should now know what i will intent)} 11. Rxe7 {ho ! i forgot this poor little pawn !} Bg4 {plan n°3...} 12. Be2 {i fell so sad, it doesnt work ! and i'm now missing a paw and he is going to push the center and surely try to have a advanced paw, this happen very often whith good oponents} Nbd7 {in way to pu it in c5 to stop the c4 paw progression and maybe to do all a mess in white camp from c5 (?)} 13. Qc2 {preparing to cancel the pin pressure, but it seems no thing more ! } Nc5 {i still dont realize it, but this knight is a very good move that will make me surprisely win this game} 14. b4 Bf5 {yes ! this is the wining move ! the queen has to move, but where ?} 15. Qd1 {now the c5 knight will start his good job going to e4, Nc3xe4 Nf6xe4 and thea1 rook is threatened ...} Nce4 {!} 16. Nxe4 Nxe4 {!} 17. Nd4 {not enought, first Ne4 c3, the queen have to move then i take with the same knight the e2 bishop, the queen has to take it an so i win the d4 knight !} Nc3 {first} 18. Qd2 Nxe2+ {second} 19. Qxe2 Bxd4 {third ! i'm know +2 and it is not finished ...} 20. Bh6 {bad : i will take the a1 rook and he will take my f8 rook, BUT my king will take back the white bishop, bad calcul from oponent} Bxa1 {win the rook} 21. Bxf8 {loose the rook (so same level)} Kxf8 {but i win the bishop ! now i'm +5, the game could go on, but white resign. }
