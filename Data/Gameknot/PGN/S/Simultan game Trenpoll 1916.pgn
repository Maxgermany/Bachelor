1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 Nxd5 5. Ne4 f5 {the sqaure e5 is now a weakness in blacks  camp , which Alekhine using that for hes favor with art .} 6. Ng5 {god move , the idea of 6.Ng5! is the maneuvering the white Knight to e5 by , Nf3,Ne5. as i mentioned earlier , the square e5 is  a weakness for black so even if  it seems that Alekhine maneuvered hes knight from g5, f3,e5 which a waist of  time , the white knight will take powerful  spot which is so important  and will be one of the reasons  to Alekhines great victory . .} Be7 7. Ng5f3 c6 8. Ne5 O-O 9. Ngf3 b6 10. Bd3 Bb7 11. O-O Re8 12. c4 {it seems that the black pisces are missplaced , and suffering from very passive and stuck game.} Nf6 13. Bf4 Nbd7 14. Qe2 c5 15. Nf7 {from no where , its like  a thunder in bright day . this is a start of gloryious combination which is hard to analysist at first .} Kxf7 {this if forced  because if the black wont take the knight offer , and will retreat with the queen to c8, whit will start very dangerous mate attack .for example :15.Nf7!!!-Qc8?.16.Qxh6 with wining position for white .} 16. Qxe6+ {magnifisent , capturing the queen will cause immidiate mate : 16...Kxe6.17.Ng5#} Kg6 {if 16...Kf8?.17.Ng5 with double mate threat wich black wont survive .} 17. g4 {good move , another mate threat ,} Be4 18. Nh4# {and the knockout , for me that wasn't one of the greatest game ever , this is the best game of all time . i hope you enjoyed the game , thank you and i would like to read your comments }
