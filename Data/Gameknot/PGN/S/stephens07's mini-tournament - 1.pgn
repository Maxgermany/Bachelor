1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 {Slave defense, the Blacks refused the queen's gambit with 2. ... c6. The objective is to play e6 after Bf5.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 Bf5 {The normal continuation.} 5. g3 {I don't think this variation is the best the White camp can have. I believe that 5.Bg5 is better.} e6 {To finish the opening with Bb4, and Nbd7.} 6. Bg2 Nbd7 7. O-O Bb4 {The Black development is finished, they just need to castle in the king side.} 8. Bd2 O-O 9. Ne5 {It is a possible variation, but not in this position.} Bxc3 10. Bxc3 Nxe5 11. dxe5 Ne4 {If white bishop in g2 takes, the black bishop is on e4, and he attack the white castle.} 12. g4 {12. g4 ? give a pawn. Even if white bishop takes Knight in e4, Blacks got the center after the queens exchange. Schmoid maybe thinks that I wanted to capture the bishop in c3.} Bxg4 13. Bf3 {13. Bf3??  Blacks got an advantage of position (Ne4) and of material (the pawn). This follow is the worst Whites could find.} Bh3 {Attack the rook in the castle.

The bishop can't move, and there is no solution to avoid the checkmate.} 15. f4 Qxg2# {}
