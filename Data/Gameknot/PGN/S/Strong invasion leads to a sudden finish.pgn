1. Nf3 f5 {Usually, d5 is the most popular reply to Nf3. It lets Black establish a strong pawn center. Nf6 is another popular move for a symmetrical game, perhaps, for a while. But I taught my kids the Dutch Defense to d4 a few months ago, so let's see if he'll let me transpose into it.} 2. c4 Nf6 3. d4 {See, now we're playing the Dutch. The Dutch can lead to wild and exciting games -- that's the number one thing I'm interested in when I play chess. It's nice to win, but it's even better, for me, to have an interesting and fun game.} e6 {And I'm going to use a Stonewall setup. That's where there are pawns on c6, d5, e6, and f5.} 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 {Shock! That is not a typical move, and I didn't find it referenced in any of my books on the Dutch. Usually, when White plays d4, c4 openings. he keeps the tension on d5 long into the game. I wonder if he thinks he sees something to exploit.} exd5 6. Bg2 Bd6 {The dark bishop is extremely important in the Dutch. With the pawns on all of the White squares, it's up to this bishop to protect the dark ones. It's important to be thinking about what you're going to do to cover your weaknesses in your games.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Nc3 {He's making good moves.  I haven't made any terribly weak moves, so he's developing more pieces before trying to start an attack.} c6 9. Ne5 {That's normal in the Dutch. White's knight likes to go to e5, and Black's knight will go to e4. Sometimes you get real wild positions if those knights are traded off and pawns recapture -- you end up with a white pawn on e5 and a black pawn on e4.} Be6 {It's a little easier for me to develop in this game since he's taken the pawn on e6. Normally, to use this bishop, it either has to go to b7 or go to d7 then e8 and then f7 or h5.} 10. Bf4 {I'd been thinking about Nbd7 to chase away his knight, but now I can't do it. I have to be careful of his knight moving. Right now, my queen's protecting my bishop on d6, but if I put a knight on d7, then I have to watch for discovered attacks. Normally, White likes to play Bf4 to get rid of Black's powerful bishop, and it's a good move for Black to capture Bxf4 and force White to recapture with gxf4; that hurts White's kingside a lot. But I'm wondering if White will play Nd3 to enable him to recapture with the knight instead of the bishop.} Ne4 {Ne4 is always a good move for Black in the Dutch.} 11. Qb3 {That's sneaky! He's threatening 12. Nxe4 fxe4; 13. Bxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned because the bishop on e6 is unguarded. I thought about playing Nxc3 here. That's a trap -- if he plays Qxb7, I'll play Nxe2+ and then Qb6 (and if he plays Qxa8 after that, Nd7 traps his queen).} Qe7 {This move protects both of my bishops and my pawn on b7.  What I'm nervous about is that my queen is being used to guard two pieces and a pawn. I have to watch out for combinations against her being overworked. Next, I may play Na6, looking at Rc8 and c5 at some point.} 12. Rfd1 {Well, that surprised me a little. I was expecting him to put a rook on c1. It may be that he's anticipating my playing Na6 and looking at c5, and then he would want a rook on the d-file to be hitting the pawn on d5.} Na6 {But I don't see any good alternatives to Na6. I have to get the knight out and let my rooks get connected, and Nd7 isn't an option because I lose my pawn on b7.   I looked for a while at how I might play g5 to chase off his bishop. The books I taught from showed lots of games where Black's surprisingly safe when playing g5 in the Dutch. I think it's because White's queen is on the queenside and diagonals to the king are blocked, so White really can't take good advantage of the move. For Black, it leads to f4 at some point, and my queen and a rook and bishops and a knight are ready to attack his king if I can open it up a little.  But, for now, I can't play g5 because he can trade knights first on e5 then take the pawn with the bishop. And if I take back with the queen, he plays Qxb7. But I'm going to remember that move in case I can use it still, coming up. } 13. Nd3 {Yeah, I thought I saw that move coming.  I can't trade on f4 because it makes his knight too powerful and I have to move my bishop to f7. That's not a bad square for it (it lets the bishop go over to h5 at the right time), but I'd rather not block my rook yet.   } Rab8 {I looked at g5 again, but I lose a pawn after. 13 â€¦ g5; 14. Nxe4 fxe4; 15. Bxd6 Qxd6; 16. Qxb7.    I didn't find any real strong offensive moves, so I chose a defensive move that stop the Qxb7 threat. Now g5 becomes an option -- though I have a feeling he's planning to trade my bishop on d6 and then put the knight back on e5 even.    Sometimes it's good to ask which is your worst piece, and then make plans to improve it. I don't like my knight on a6. It doesn't stop anything, and I'm not sure it threatens anything -- unless I want to play c5. I have to look at that. It threatens c4. But if he trades pawns on c5, I'm not sure that helps me, and my pawn in the center is isolated and weak. The other choices for my knight are b4, but that's not good. It chases his knight back to a better square (e5), it's easily chased away by a3 (and can only return to a6), and it's not even safe after White plays Bxd6 and removes one of its defenders. So that means that the knight is going to c7. But what can it do there unless I move my other bishop and let it go to e6.   I feel like I don't have any real weaknesses, but I don't have a strong plan yet.} 14. e3 {That surprised me. I was certain he planned to trade my bishop and put his knight back on e5. I'm not sure what he's up to. This closes the position even more and makes my position even safer. His, too.} Bxf4 {So I decided to do what I'd rejected before. I'm going to trade the bishops. I'm sure he'll recapture with the knight, and I'm kind of hoping, even, that he'll trade his knight for my other bishop. In closed positions like this, knights generally have a big advantage over bishops. Notice that all of pawns on white squares make both of our light bishops pretty ineffective. His hope for an advantage might be to trade his knight for my bishop, put his on h3, and then trade knights on e4. If I take back fxe4, suddenly his bishop would control an important line behind my pawns.     What I'm looking at is getting my knights to d6 and f6 (I'm guessing his other choice is to play f3 to chase mine off of its powerful post). Then, if he plays Ne5, I'll be able to play Nf7 to challenge it.   That's a lot of knight moves, but that's the big difference between open and closed game. This is a closed game; look how there aren't any open lines and the pawns block attempts to get to the other king. In closed positions, knights are stronger because they can get past the roadblocks. Also, attacks develop much more slowly. You don't have to be as concerned about rapidly developing attacks because the lines of attack just don't exist yet. In closed positions, be willing to take your time to get your pieces to the best square; don't rush your attack.} 15. exf4 {That's a huge surprise to me. I felt that his knight would be very strong on f4. Maybe he was worried about me playing g5, but then he'd just go back to d3 and e5.   When your opponent surprises you, think about what he's planning to do. He didn't just arbitrarily make a bad move; he has a plan in mind that I'll have to deal with. The sooner I can figure out what he's up to, the better off I'll be.   I think he's telling me that he cleared out the e-file so he can post rooks on it and dominate it. If he puts a rook on e1 and plays f3 to chase away my knight, he might be planning to put the rook on e5 and then the other one on e1. It'd be hard to withstand the pressure on my bishop.   I need to decide if I want to stay defensive and play Nc7 which would support that bishop. Or do I want to break open the other side with c5 while I have two knights and a queen supporting that move.} Rfe8 16. Ne5 Nc7 {This was a tough move. I was looking at Nc7 and Qd6. Either way, I'm committed to being in a defensive position until he makes a mistake or breaks it open. What finally led me to Nc7 instead of Qd6 was in case he plays f3, I'm thinking that I might want to play Nd6.  Though it just occurred to me, now that I've made the move, that if he chase my knight to d6 and then plays Qa4 (I'll play Ra8), then Nxc6 to trade the knight for two pawns is uncomfortable for me.} 17. Rde1 Qd6 18. Rad1 Qe7 {I almost played Bf7 here, which would've been a disaster. I was wondering if he would give up his strong knight for my last bishop - but then I saw that I lose a pawn after    19. Bxe4   fxe4    20. Nxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned and can't take it back.   Instead, I'm just waiting to see what his plan is. But I'm playing Black against a higher-rated opponent, so I don't mind if I can keep anything from happening and get a draw.} 19. Na4 Na6 {So do I really think he's planning to play Nc5? If so, he needs to get rid of my N on e4 first. Would he trade the B for it? That'd be unusual -- almost admitting that White's B is as weak as Black's B. I think it is in the Stonewall, but that's not the common consensus. He might play f3, but that makes that bishop even weaker. Perhaps he's planning to redeploy it on f1. That would chase my N back to c7. It'd be surprising to see that B traded for either N, but all of my queenside pawns become very vulnerable and weak if I let him trade on a6.} 20. Bf1 Nc7 {No way I can let him take trade on a6. Sure, I get a discovered attack with the queen, but it's just going to go to c2, and my pawn on c6 becomes way too weak -- lots of pieces can attack it, and there's no pawn that can protect it.   So after he plays f3 to chase my knight to d6 and he puts his knight on c5, I've got to figure out what I'll want to do. Maybe I need to be thinking about a rook on c8, play b6 to chase the knight off of c6, and then I can play c5. But I'm sure he'll have a rook on c1 by then to stop that from happening. We'll see.} 21. Qc2 Qf6 22. Nc5 Qe7 {I thought about trading knights, but I really don't want his queen on c5. I'm not happy with either way to guard a7. But now that my queen's on e7, I think I'd be willing to trade knights and then queens on c5.} 23. b4 Bf7 {I see lots of ways for me to lose a pawn or more and no counterattacks yet. I'd like to swing my B to the other side of the pawns (though I'll have to look closer to see if there's any way it can be safe on e4 -- probably not because of Be2 and f3)   If he plays Bh3, I'm going to have to return to e6.} 24. f3 Bh5 {I'm sure on the tightrope here. I don't like how vulnerable so many of my pieces are.  What I especially have to watch out for is if I move my knight off of e4 (like Nd6 or Nxc5), then I have to worry that any move from his knight on e5 (like Nxc6) attacks my queen with his rook.} 25. fxe4 Bxd1 {I really don't have any choice here. Now the fun starts, but I can tell I'm not going to be happy with it. By the time we're done, he'll have two minor pieces compared to my extra rook. The problem is that in this closed position, the rooks don't have as much scope as a bishop and extra knight. I think I'd rather be in his position.} 26. Qxd1 fxe4 27. Bh3 Nb5 28. Be6+ Kh8 29. Ng6+ {Pretty. It looks like he has a nice, little mate-in-two set up after I take the knight. Well, not really a forced mate, I can trade my Q for his B to postpone it. Such a deal!} hxg6 30. Qg4 {Yeah, I knew he saw this before he played Ng6+. Time to move on to the next game.}
