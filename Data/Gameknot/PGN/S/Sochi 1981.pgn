1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nf3 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5 5. Nb5 {Indian Defence is hereby played out.} d5 {(!?) Black sacrifices a pawn in an attempt to complete development as quickly as possible.} 6. cxd5 Bc5 {Obviously, 6...Nxd5?? Lost since 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc7... One recommended variation is 7.N1c3!?... And White should start thinking about development.} 7. d6 {(?) The single-mindedness of material gain leads to the strong attack performed by Black.} O-O {(!) A further sacrifice. 7...Ne4? Would give White the advantage after 8.e3 Nxd6 9.Qd5!...} 8. Nc7 {(?) White's tunnel vision of material gain is the wrong game plan! Nonetheless, it's important to mention that other better variations aren't satisfactory to improvement for White : 8.e3 Nc6 9.Be2 a6 with material equality and an advantage for Black. Also, 8.Be3 Bxe3 9.fxe3 Na6 10.N1c3 Bd7 11.Qd2 Bxb5 12.Nxb5 Ne4 13.Qd5 Qa5+ 14.Nc3 Nac5 with some dangerous threats from Black. ( If you like this game, look at this one - Svedchikov - Ceytlin [USSR 1977])} Ne4 {(!) The initiative is clearly with Black. The checkmate threat on f2 provides this.} 9. e3 {9.Be3... Wouldn't help since 9...Bxe3 10.fxe3 Qf6! And an excellent game for Black. This is shown since 11.Qc2 Qf2+ 12.Kd1 Qxe3 OR 11.Qb3 Qf2+ 12.Kd1 Rd8 OR 11.Qd3 Nf2!} Bb4+ 10. Ke2 {No other defence exists! Other options : 10.Nc3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Bxc3+ 12.Bd2 Bxa1 13.Qxa1 Qxd6 14.Nxa8 Nc6 - Black regains the knight after ...Bf5 and has both positional and material advantage! : 10.Nd2 Qxd6 11.Nxa8 Rd8 -/+ : 10.Bd2 Nxd2 11.Nxd2 Qxd6 12.Nxa8 Rd8 -/+ The attack gains full flow in the last two examples.} Qh4 11. f3 {11.g3 Nxg3+! 12.hxg3... (12.fxg3 Qh5+) 12...Qxh1 13.f3...(threat of Bg4+) 13...Rd8} Qf2+ 12. Kd3 Nxd6 {The rook is irrelevant.13.Nxa8? Bf5+ 14.e4 Nxe4! With a nearly immediate win for Black. White is forced to defend.} 13. Qe2 Bf5+ 14. e4 Qd4+ 15. Kc2 Rc8 {(!) After wasting four tempi on the White knight on c7, he's now lost in enemy territory, and will concede a tempo to boot.} 16. exf5 {The same result would occur with 16.Be3 Rxc7+ 17.Nc3 Rxc3! 18.bxc3 Qxc3+ 19.Kb1 Nxe4!} Rxc7+ 17. Nc3 Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3+ {0-1 Moral of the story: DON'T waste tempi on pieces with no future.}
