1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Book so far.} d6 {Unnecessarily blocks in the KB and cramps Black's position. 3... B-B4 is the correct move.} 4. O-O {Bernstein, quite properly, tucks away his King befor engaging in complications.} Nge7 {Another bad move. 4... N-B3, or even 4... N-R3 to add extra protection to the KBP, would allow 5... B-K2 and 6... O-O, getting the King to a relatively safe spot.} 5. Ng5 {Bernstein takes immediate advantage, pressuring KB7 at once.} f6 {Opening the diagonal fully for the Bishop and ensuring his King will never have a safe haven.} 6. Bf7+ {Forcing the monarch to bestir himself.} Kd7 {The only square.} 7. Qg4+ {Adding force to the attack.} f5 {7... N-B4 isn't any better. Black's position is shattered already, just 7 moves in.} 8. exf5 {Setting up a vicious discovery.} h5 {White could win slowly with 9 BxRP, or quickly with...} 9. f6+ {...this move.} hxg4 {In spite of removing the Q, Black is still mated in 2 moves.} 10. Be6+ {Forcing the King to...} Ke8 {...this square, where...} 11. f7# {...this Pawn finishes the game with a flourish.}
