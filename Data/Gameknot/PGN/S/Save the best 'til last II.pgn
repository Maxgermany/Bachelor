[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence, Nimzovich attack"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Generally, I play 3. Bc4. However, I recently lost a few games with Evans Gambit and Guioco Piano openings so I decided to change this game. I didn't realise until after I played my move that it was the same opening that we played in our previous game or I may well have avoided it.} d6 {An unusual response to the Ruy Lopez. It opens the knight to be pinned, but provides some support to e5. My personal opinion is that it is weak for Black.} 4. d4 exd4 5. Qxd4 {I grab at the centre with d4 and he exchanges pawns. I really wasn't sure which piece to take with here - I chose to leave my knight where it is and develop my queen. } Bd7 {Rather expected - protects his knight but also releases the pin to attack my queen in the centre of the board.} 6. Bxc6 bxc6 {I thought he might take with the bishop after developing it to d7. I really didn't expect my opponent to double his pawns after our previous game, which involved a lot of exchanges and was quickly at a knight and pawn ending. GK analysis pits this as 'Inaccuracy'.} 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. O-O {Standard development of the knights followed by a castle - I do think I probably should have played 10. Bg5 here though. I think the reason I didn't was not to give him a reason to play Be7 yet.} c5 9. Qd3 {Doesn't appear to be any immediate threat to the queen on d3, it keeps the DSB diagonal open and it is more actively placed than d1. The rooks will also connect once that bishop moves...} Be7 {Developing the bishop and preparing to castle, one would assume - I thought he'd attack the half-open b-file first.} 10. e5 dxe5 11. Nxe5 {I'm not sure if 10... Ng4 is more favourable for Black? In fact, looking back now it seems as if 10. e5 might have been a mistake. Anyway, Black has let my knight move in to a centre square.} Be6 {White moves his attacked bishop, I presumed to save his bishop pair and make use of them later. However, he gave up a very attack square for my knight on c6.} 12. Qxd8+ Rxd8 13. Nc6 {Making use of c6 to fork the rook, bishop and pawn.} Ra8 {I've forced the Black rook back into the corner in it's attempt to save a pawn (and the knight-rook exchange).} 14. Nxe7 {I saw Nb5 and it looked good until I saw the line 14. Nb5 Bc4 15. Nxc7+ Kd7 16. Nxa8 Bxf1 17. Kxf1 Kxc6... with me losing my other knight shortly after. If there is a better alternative, I'd like to hear it. So instead I decide to rid my opponent of his bishop pair, as I'm sure he was trying to keep them and they can be very dangerous!} Kxe7 15. Bg5 {Pinning the knight but also prevents the king from moving unless Black would like another set of doubled pawns. Here, even though the material is even, I believe I am in a very strong position. Oh, how quickly that changed...} Rab8 16. b3 c4 {And how the board quickly looks much more even as Black un-doubles his c-pawns. He has two isolated pawns still, but it looks much better now.} 17. Rfe1 {Threatening to use both pins with a very subtle 18. Nd5+ and winning a pawn in the ensuing exchange.} Rhd8 18. Rad1 {Challenging the open d-file - I wanted to keep my rook on a1 (to threaten an attack on a7) but couldn't really give over control of this file, I didn't think.} Rxd1 19. Rxd1 cxb3 20. axb3 {20. axb3 largely because rook pawns are harder to promote in an end game, should I get a passed pawn on that side.} h6 21. Bxf6+ Kxf6 {Avoiding doubling pawns on the king-side now!} 22. Nd5+ {Threatening to win a pawn from Black and forcing him to whittle it down to a Rook and pawn ending, while developing my rook actively.} Bxd5 23. Rxd5 Re8 24. f3 {I'm not in the business of being caught by those checkmates anymore! And 24... Re2 is countered by Rc5. I chose f3 over Kf1 because it gives my king squares to move to (f2-g3, if need be) and Re2 isn't a threat with either move.} Re7 25. Ra5 {Attacking the a-pawn and forcing c6 from Black.} c6 26. Ra6 {Now I'm forcing Black to tie up his rook in defending and releasing his grip on the e-file.} Rc7 27. Kf2 Ke5 {Releasing the pin on the c-pawn and coming across to defend the pawn.... or so I think.} 28. Ke3 c5 {I wasn't sure about this move, but I suppose it releases the rook from the c-file. But it means my rook looks over the 6th rank...} 29. f4+ {Black has to be wary here... 29... Kd5?? 30. c4#.} Kf5 30. h3 {Pushing the pawn with tempo - threatening checkmate with g4 now.} f6 {Giving himself an escape square on g6...} 31. g4+ {... which I immediately force him onto. As with our other annotated game, I've managed to force an advantage in the endgame that has given me an advantage. This time, I've forced his black king away from the action and have got my king very active itself. I must concede though, it is still very much heading for a draw at the minute.} Kg6 32. h4 {I 'settled' on this move here - I really couldn't decide what my best move was and lumped with this to try and make it tough for Black's king to get out of the corner. Maybe Kd3 was a slightly better alternative?} c4 33. b4 {I didn't think taking it and allowing the rook in behind was a great idea... it would definitely yield a draw then.} Rb7 34. c3 Rd7 {It was a complete oversight that I allowed Black to attack me and threaten d3 - I was so busy trying to think how I was going to attack Black and try to promote a pawn. Upon analysis, it is quickly obvious that Black is giving up a passed pawn to White for several of his pawns.} 35. h5+ {I decide to use this check now. If Black intends to come down to d3 with his rook, then the king cannot go to f7 as it would give up a tempo with Rxa7+ later.} Kh7 36. Ke4 {I wasn't sure what else to play really - I'm waiting on Rd3 for the action to start so I play a waiting move that saves me time by avoiding a check.} Rd3 37. Rxa7 Rxc3 {A pawn each, but I can't stop there - my rook and king are both active, so I give up my king-side pawns to get that b-pawn further up the board.} 38. Kd4 Rg3 39. Kxc4 {The first and only move highlighted by GK's computer as yellow - an inaccuracy. An instant 39. b5 Rxg4 40. b6 Rxf4+ 41. Kc3 Rf5 42. b7 Rb5 43. Kxc4 Rb1, means I save the h-pawn. However, the line given seems to whittle to a perpetual check draw (as White cannot defend the pawn and avoid the check). I'm not saying my way was correct because it should have played to a draw, but I certainly believe my line forces the rook to exchange for the passed pawn, leaving the rook to do battle with the three pawns.} Rxg4 40. b5 Rxf4+ 41. Kc3 {Again, it doesn't look great but there was reasoning (it could be bad reasoning!!). The king has to move up later to defend the pawn which makes Kc5 more attractive. Once the Black rook gets rid of my h-pawn, I can move the king up and force the Rook around via h1 or h2. Then I plan to bring my rook down to the 4th rank as defense to both the rook and the later advancing pawns. It is also worth noting that I think I incorrectly analysed that following Kc5, the rook could take the pawn and travel via e5-e8-b8 to stop the pawn - obviously it cannot. } Rf5 42. b6 Rxh5 43. Kc4 {Stopping Rb5 and forcing it around the board to defend the threat.} Rh1 44. Ra4 {I want my rook here for later - I feel it restrains Black's later charge with those three pawns as he cannot push one of his pawns then look to catch-up to it... Black will need his king.} Rc1+ 45. Kb5 {45... Rb1+ is clearly a blunder due to 46. Rb4 and the Black rook can no longer stop the pawn from queening.} Rc8 46. b7 Rb8 {Black's rook has made it to the square it wants and it is now up to my king to catch up to it before it can come back to prevent this mass run of pawns.} 47. Kc6 h5 48. Kc7 Rxb7+ 49. Kxb7 {Okay, so here it is. Three pawns and a king vs a rook and a king. Who wins? I'm a fairly nervous at this point; I don't know if three pawns can push past a rook but I'm confident if I can get my king back to the action that I can at least force a draw. Worse case scenario, I'm going to sacrifice my rook for the f and g-pawns knowing that with two kings and a rook pawn in the corner... it is only likely to be a draw.} g5 50. Kc6 Kg6 51. Kd5 Kf5 {These last two moves really weakened my score on GK analysis. Maybe it is because it looks even more like a draw with the kings in this position.} 52. Kd4 Kf4 53. Kd3+ Kf3 {+0.02 on GK analysis and very much a draw until Black's next move.} 54. Ra6 f5 {This is the first mistake from my opponent in the endgame. I have to commend my opponent as by saving his f-pawn, he is clearly showing that he is trying to win the game. However, it is in vain and 54. h4 would have given him an easy draw.} 55. Ra5 {The king is now forced onto the 4th rank to protect it's pawns, and allows my king into e2. } Kg4 56. Ke2 {From this position, I am very confident I will get a draw minimum. Black's pawns are lined up, his king placed in front of them and my king has arrived on the scene.} f4 {Another mistake - I knew here that I was winning a pawn... and without giving Black the compensation of time to threaten with pawn pushes.} 57. Kf2 {Black's options - 1) 57... Kh3 58. Rxg5, the f-pawn is easily targeted and White can mop up the h-pawn easily enough. 2) 57... Kh4 58. Kf3 g4+ 59. Kxf4 g3 60. Kf3 g2 61. Kxg2 or 60... Kh3 61. Rxh5#. 3) 57... f3, I didn't analyse this much at the time, but the f-pawn is lost to either Ra4+ or Ra3 (alternatively, Rb5 wastes a tempo and forces to Black to move a pawn). I'd like to think I could take the two pawns apart with my rook though. The last possible move is 57... h4, which my opponent plays.} h4 58. Kg2 {This is the killer move for White here. This looks like a position one might consider zugzwang, with all of black's moves making his position worse. 1) 58... Kh5 59. Kh3 f3 60. Rf5 Kg6 61. Kg4 h3 62. Rxf3 h2 62. Rh3 and White wins. The win in the next position is a bit more subtle. 2) 58... h3 59. Kh2 Kh4 60. Ra4!! (White wants to play Ra3 but needs a waiting move, and this stops Black from playing g4.) 60... Kg4 61. Ra3!... and White wins the h-pawn.} f3+ {This gives White quite an easy time, I think.} 59. Kf2 {If 59... Kh3, 60. Rxg5 wins for White as long as White is careful about not giving Black a stalemate in the corner.} h3 60. Ra4+ Kh5 61. Kxf3 {61. Kg3 g4 62. Rxg4 as 62... h2 63. Rh4+ or 62... f2 63. Rf4 h2 64. Kxh2... both win too!} g4+ 62. Kg3 {My opponent resigned here... it was an interesting game that I don't feel I played great in, but I enjoyed playing the endgame... it was only two errors in judgment of position, that led to Black trying to force a win that helped me to get the win in this game. I hope you all enjoy analysing another game with an interesting endgame and I look forward to your comments.}
