[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C66), Berlin defence, hedgehog variation"]

1. e4 {White's aggressive opening move opens lines for the queen and king's bishop and fights for control of the squares d5 and f5. } e5 {Black plays the classical response to 1. e4. By mirroring White's move Black has guaranteed himself an equal share of the centre and scope to develop his pieces. 1...e5 is one of the few moves that directly interferes with White's plan of playing d4.} 2. Nf3 {Ye olde stuff here. I attack Black's king pawn, preparing for kingside castling, and preparing for d2â€“d4. } Nc6 {Is the natural move, combining defence of the pawn with control of the d4 square and refusing to commit another pawn. The extent of this move's popularity is such that the typical player of 2. Nf3 as White is already thinking beyond it to their third move, safe in the knowledge that any variation by Black will play into their hands.  White has multiple choices here which can lead to very different games. 3. Bb5 (Ruy Lopez) is the most played. White puts pressure on the knight defending the pawn. I was thinking of 3. d4 (Scotch) because my opponent wanted a "Fast correspondence game" and 3. d4 is aggressive but decided against it as I have not played it in a very long time...not seriously anyways...} 3. Bb5 {Enter the Ruy Lopez. White threatens to trade the bishop against the knight, leaving the pawn undefended. It is not a real threat as after 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, Black can fork the knight and a pawn with 5...Qd4 or 5...Qg5. As nothing's urgent, Black can respond in a variety of ways. The most common move is the Morphy defence : 3...a6, forcing White to make a decision about his bishop. Many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.   I assumed he would choose a route that would let us really open of the center...  } Nf6 {The Berlin Defence!?!?!, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is sometimes called "the Berlin Wall". This was not what I expected considering they wanted this game to be a SPEED GAME! If he wanted fast and some action why did he not take 3. ... a6  so might be able to follow 4. Bxc6 (Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation) or any other line for that matter?} 4. O-O {I follow the line by the numbers (Yes I have my notes open at this time) and castle. I wondered if he thought I might come with 4. d3 ("Steinitz's move") and set myself up for Mortimer's Trap. Maybe so...that might explain what happened next.} d6 {He already went with the Berlin Defence line in this so called "Speed Correspondence Game" and now...he closes it!?!?! He could have played the solid 4...Nxe4 or the more combative 4...Bc5 (the Berlin Classical Variation), but no...I am stuck trying to hurry through ...sharp lines...open it up...anything... cause he wants to be done in an hour!  } 5. d4 {Here I go making yet another attempt to get us away from slow and drawish. Even if it actually increases his winning chances! } Bd7 6. Bg5 Be7 7. d5 {I have done what I can to continue to develop safely up to this point and attack get some kind of middle game going.  We are out of my notes now and there is just too much shit on the board still for me to count very far ahead.  This pawn move, I thought, should make him shit or get off the pot! I thought maybe he would 7. ... Nb4. Then maybe I would follow up with 8. Qe2 and he would 8. ... 0-0 and finally castle and we could get a move on. Could have even gone  7. ... Nb4  8.Bxd7 followed by either Nxd7 or Qxd7  and then 9.a3 with his Knight backed up to a6 square.} Nb8 {NOPE!!! He backed up to his starting square.  Now he kinda makes me bring my queen out to d3 (i guess Qe2 would have worked too) to defend both the the pawn at e4 and the bishop at b5.    I considered 8.Nc3 to defend the same squares but this was not some lightning real time game on yahoo (Where I know I would have done it). I started playing correspondence so I could take my time and develop as a player...see deeper faster...learn more theory.  I saw lines like 8. ... Nxe4 9. Bxe7 Qxe7 10. Nxe4 Bxb5  where I am down a pawn and have my rook under attack by Blacks's light bishop. Getting in a hurry would have cost me material and momentum.} 8. Qd3 {I chose this over 8. Bxd7 to deny him a chance to re-develop his b1 Knight with Nb1xd7. I worried he might 8. ... Nxe4 this move than covered that.   If for example they 8. ... Nxe4 I could follow with 9. Bxd7+. Black's response to that could have been 9. ... Nxd7 or Qxd7 and would still get hammered by 10. Qxe4 scooping back the lost material +2. } O-O 9. Nc3 a6 {Black finally castles, I develop my Knight to the c3 square and black attacks my light bishop on b5. Finally black does something less that passive.} 10. Bxd7 {I did those to avoid all together 10. Ba4 b5 11. Bb3  lines that might involve me moving a3 at some point and tucking my light bishop into the a2 square. I am ahead} Qxd7 11. h3 {I saw combinations of h6 attacking my dark bishop and blacks night on the g4 sqaure in my future without this move. Although I did almost move Ra1-e1 here, I did not want to give up a chance to attack on the queen side near his idle queenside knight. With 11. h3 I made h7-h6 a pointless waste of time and gave my self a few moves to get over to his queen side without his night in my house.} Nh5 {No point in getting into a fight here that could result with a knight attacking my Queen from f4 so...} 12. Be3 Nf6 {...I tuck back my bishop and Black pulls back his knight...looks to me like I just gained momentum from Black without even thinking more than 1 move ahead!!!} 13. Rae1 c6 {I brought the rook over generally to support my coming f and e pawn pushes that I hope are coming...no real depth of play other than in the vague visions provided by just a couple moves thought. Blacks pushing the c pawn was lost on me and I spent little time on it because it gave me my first choice of direction...a Queen Side attack} 14. Na4 {With a queen/rook fork on the horizon black is now paying for the reverse development of the knight. } Qc7 {As the capture of the rook was certain black seems to have decided to make room for his underachieving knight to get out of the way...} 15. Nb6 {Moving the queen tell me that they had to suffer this process for longer than a lesser player might have...} Nbd7 {and still ...nothing they can do to stop it....} 16. Nxa8 {Chomp!!!!} Rxa8 {+2!! and ready to push} 17. c4 {Now I will share the chat dialog...  that led up to the Draw over the course of the game.... me: Speedgame? maxiol09: Yes, game in 1 hour! me: ohhh ok then i can stay up  me: hope you dont mind i have Ruy notes open maxiol09: ok, all right me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9K-PhNVeEk&feature=player_embedded me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZtlwxgGKv8&feature=plcp&context=C3d38898UDOEgsToPDskKu2Icvy6t-8bqDjWRe0_7N maxiol09: No in this moment me: Even with the two pawn gain...i would rather offer draw...want a Draw? ( I said this after he opened the b6 square to my night with 13. ... c6) me: will give you a couple minutes to think about it...next move is Na8 maxiol09: I don't understand me: My next move...Na8 i will trade Knight for Rook a plus two point (or pawn) gain in material...even though it puts me ahead ...I would be willing to give you a draw....as I am not at ease with my chances of winning (not in a couple minutes anyways) me: Do you want me to offer a Draw? maxiol09: why? we just started playing! me: i dont think i can finish in one hour and beat you...if you dont mind it going over its ok (I offered the draw after the c4 push)  It took me an hour to get where I wanted to be (13. ... c6 )in an open I am not familiar with...I knew that they wanted it short from the start...so I gave away what was in my mind...a sure win... :-(}
