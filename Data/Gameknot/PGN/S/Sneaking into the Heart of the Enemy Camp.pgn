1. e4 c5 {A Mini-tournament game, I play the Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 {Transposed into the Grand Prix Attack. } 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Bb5 Nd4 {White's goal with 5. Bb5 in the Grand Prix is doubling the black pawns on the c-file by exchaning on c6. This move denies him that chance.} 6. O-O Nxb5 7. Nxb5 d5 {Challenging the center with a bit of a gambit move.} 8. exd5 a6 {Clearly not 8. ... Qxd5?? losing the queen to 9. Nc7+.} 9. Nc3 Nf6 {Aiming to regain the pawn.} 10. d4 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 Qxd5 {Done.} 12. Be3 c4 13. c3 O-O 14. Qd2 Bf5 {White's Grand Prix Attack has netted a fairly even middlegame in which black has the bishop pair advantage.} 15. Rae1 Rfe8 {Preparing to advance the 3-pawn. It's going to want support from a pawn on f6 first.} 16. Qf2 Bd3 {Oops. 16. Qf2? was a mistake, allowing the black bishop to sneak into the heart of the enemy camp and win the exchange.} 17. Qg3 Bxf1 18. Kxf1 e6 19. h4 Qa5 {A lame attack against a2. I didn't see anything better. Black is ahead by the exchange, but with all the pawns on the board, well placed, there seems to be little either side can do to gain a useful attack.} 20. a3 Rad8 {Seizing the half-open d-file.} 21. Bc1 h5 {Blocking the potential advance of white's h-pawn to strike at black's castle.} 22. Ne5 Qc7 {Defending the pawn on c4.} 23. f5 exf5 {23. f5? seems to have been ill-prepared. It had the potential to wreck black's castle if black replied 23. ... gxf5?, but 23. ... exf5 simply refutes the move entirely, costing white a pawn.} 24. Bf4 Qb6 {Sneaking out of the possible discovered attack and gunning for b2.} 25. Re2 Qb3 {Setting up a more dangerous threat. Black needs to remove the obstructions on the open e-file now.} 26. Qf2 f6 27. Nxg6 Qd1+ {The sacrifice of the g6 pawn removed the white knight from the e-file, allowing black's rook to support an attack on the white king.} 28. Qe1 Qxe2+ 29. Qxe2 Rxe2 30. Kxe2 Re8+ {Now that most of the major pieces are removed, it would be nice if a rook could cover e5, and fortunately one can, with gain of a tempo by delivering check.} 31. Kf3 {Final position. White moved, then realized that black can play 31. ... Kf2 attacking the white knight who now has nowhere to go. 32. Ne5 fxe5 33. dxe5 Bxe5 34. Bxe5 Rxe5 leaves black up a rook with an easily winnable endgame. White resigned.}
