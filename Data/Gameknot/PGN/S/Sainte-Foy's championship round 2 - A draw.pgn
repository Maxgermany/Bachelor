[Round "1"]
[White "Me (1842)"]
[Black "Opponent (1943)"]
[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B10)"]

1. e4 {I kick off the game with a standard e4.} c6 {My opponent plays the Caro-Kann, which is a relatively safe opening for black. Black prepares a d5 push in order to contest my e4 pawn.} 2. f4 {The usual move here is 2.d4, but I had some other plans in mind. I wanted to throw him a little off game. The main downside of this move is that it opens the g1-a7 diagonal, which could prove troublesome.} d5 {Black follows his plans, and strikes at the center.} 3. Nf3 {!? Yes, I'm leaving my e pawn ripe for the taking while also allowing my opponent to poke check my knight. However, White can either recover that lost pawn or get a huge attack.} dxe4 {Black obliges, and chases my knight away.} 4. Ng5 {I move my knight into safety and I attack the pawn.} Nf6 {Black plays the most natural move which develops a piece and protects his advanced e pawn. 4...f5 is dubious, because of 5.Bc4 (attacking f7) Nh6 6.Nxh7!? Rxh7 7.Qh5+ Kd7 8.Qg6.} 5. Bc4 {! This is not exactly what I'd call subtle, but the attack on f7 has to be dealt with. Or does it?} e6 {Well, much to my dismay, my opponent went for the safe route. The risky but still playable other option was 5...Bg4!? 6.Qxg4! Nxg4 7.Bxf7+ Kd7 8.Be6+ Kc7 9.Bxg4 and the position is very unclear.} 6. Nc3 {I hit Black's advanced e pawn once more. It is attacked twice and defended once.} Bc5 {Black decides to give back the pawn and develops his bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal, preventing me to castle kingside.} 7. Ngxe4 {I think either recapture is fine.} Bb6 {Black tucks his bishop into safety, while keeping an eye on that pesky diagonal.} 8. d3 {I free my bishop while reinforcing my advanced pieces.} O-O {Black castles.} 9. Qe2 {I move my queen out of the back rank, allowing me to eventually castle queeside. This also give me the option to play 10.Be3 to exchange bishops.} Re8 {Good move. It would be very troublesome if the e file was to open...} 10. Rf1 {I plan to play 11.f5 after black tries to open the middle with 10...e5. Even if he doesn't, my rook could jump to f3 into g3 or h3.} Nd5 {Black puts his knight on a strong square. It cannot be taken due to the discovered attack/pin on the e file.} 11. Bd2 {I develop my bishop so that I may castle next turn. } Bd4 {! Very good move. This bishop is hard to disloge even though I have quite a few pieces around!} 12. O-O-O {I castle queeside. In hindsight, that may not have been a good idea...} b5 {Black starts his queenside pawn storm. The knight on d5 cannot be taken due to 13...exd5 pinning my knight to my queen.} 13. Qh5 {!? I decide to go for the offense here; Taking my bishop now would result in 14.Nxd5 cxd5 15.Ng5 with a strong attack. This move also removes my queen from the dreaded e file. However, I missed...} g6 {I had planned to play 14.Qh6 followed by Ng5 in this case, but then I saw that Black could hold very well by playing 14...Bg7, hitting my queen and therefore winning my c4 bishop.} 14. Qh3 {The best option. I keep the pressure on the h file. However, I have to be very wary of that light-square bishop...} Bg7 {! Black plays it safely and slows my attack a lot, while keeping his pressure on my queenside. However, that means I can now save my bishop. 14...e5 would have been interesting, but dangerous after 15.f5 because it cuts the d4 bishop from his king and my d2 bishop would have gained access to his king!} 15. Bb3 {I still can't take the knight due to the discovered attack by the bishop on my queen if I do so.} a5 {Black continues his pawn push...} 16. Bxd5 {?! I had forgotten the discovered attack here... Though the resulting position gets quite complicated! Also, I should have done this move 1 turn sooner if I'd were to do it! It didn't really matter in this case, but still...} exd5 {Black obliges, and attack both my queen and knight.} 17. f5 {I block the bishop's attack on my queen. this also opens up my dark-square bishop and brings my pawn closer to my opponent's king.} dxe4 {Obviously.} 18. dxe4 {I retake with my pawn, which protects my f5 pawn and opens up the d file, in which my rook is aligned with my opponent's queen. 18.Nxe4 is also worth consideration.} Qf6 {Black moves his queen away from the d file, and forms a battery aiming at my b2 pawn, which soft-pins my c3 knight.} 19. g4 {Since I'm down a piece, the best I can do is try to attack his king and hope for a swindle. 19...Rxe4 fails due to 20.g5 Qe5 21.f6.} g5 {Black tries to block my pawn advance. } 20. Qh5 {I attack Black's g5 pawn so that I can remove it and therefore allow my kingside pawns to roll over black's defences. If Black wants to trade queens, it'll cost his g pawn!} Qh6 {Black decides to go for the queen trade anyway. I was hoping for 20...h6? 21.Na4! (Threatening 22.Bc3!) b4 (21...bxa4?? 22.Bc3 and Black's defences crumble) 22.h4} 21. Bxg5 {Obviously.} Qxh5 {Forced.} 22. gxh5 {On the plus side, the g file is open for business!} h6 {! This is rather annoying, as my bishop will get in the way of my other pieces or get attacked once my e pawn eventually falls to the rook.} 23. Be7 {!? My bishop can more or less be taken due to 24.Rd8+ forking the king and the c8 bishop and Black's knight would get pinned to his other rook. Black could do 23...Bxf5 first, which would lead to a very similar position but without a white pawn on e4. Right now, I'm threatening 24.f6, which would really cramp Black's position!} f6 {However, black sees this and gets to f6 before I can.} 24. e5 {! I attack black's f6 pawn and I free the e4 square for my knight.} Kf7 {Black puts his king into the fray and covers f6 himself} 25. exf6 {I can't avoid the trade of bishop, so I might as well get a passed pawn here.} Bxf6 {Black obliges.} 26. Bxf6 {Forced.} Kxf6 {Obviously.} 27. Rd6+ {I force the black king to fall back so that my passed f pawn can move forward.} Kg7 {He retreats his king while covering h6.} 28. f6+ {Another option would be to play 28.Rg1+ to try to win black's h pawn, but that would drop my own f pawn so I opted against it.} Kf7 {The black king continues to blockade my pawn. 29.Rd7+ is not an option this time!} 29. Rg1 {Since my f pawn is protected by my d6 rook now, I can relieve my f rook from its duty of protecting the pawn so that it can come crashing in g7. 29...Rg8 is bad due to 30.Rxg8 Kxg8 31.Rd8+.} Be6 {At this point, my opponent gave me a draw offer, which I accepted after a few minutes of analysis. I was happy enough to fight back that much after blundering a piece against a stronger opponent, and I doubt I could have won this game at that point anyway. A possible continuation could be 30.Ne4 Bd5! 31.Rg7+ Kf8 32.Nc5 Bf7 and whatever. Ratings and comments are welcome.}
