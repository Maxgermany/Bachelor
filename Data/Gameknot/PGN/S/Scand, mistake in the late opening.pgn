1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. O-O Bf5 7. Nh4 Bg6 8. d4 e6 9. g3 Bd6 {Questa mossa è un errore. Bisogna rassegnarsi: l'alfiere si deve mettere lì solo DOPO che il bianco gioca Af4, sennò... This move is a mistake. The bishop should be played there only AFTER white plays Bf4, otherwise...} 10. Nxg6 hxg6 11. Ne4 {...LO SI PERDE PER NULLA! you lose it for nothing. } Nd7 12. Nxd6+ Qxd6 13. Bf4 Qd5 {Now the plan is to act in the h column, but it is not easy to see how. } 14. c4 Qf5 15. Bg4 Qf6 {I thought I was risking in order not to stay passively, playing the queen to a5, just to take it away from the danger, but letting him go on with an attack on the center...} 16. h4 Qd8 {Almost the only move not to lose the queen.} 17. d5 {The feared one. } e5 18. dxc6 exf4 19. Bxd7+ Kf8 20. Qd6+ {Now, a blunder. I should have moved the queen instead, but with no hope. } Ne7 21. c7 {}
