[Opening "Caro-Kann (B14), Panov-Botvinnik attack, 5...e6"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 {it has been a very long time since I have had to face the panov attack. I predict that I will have no trouble in this game as I am very skilled in handling the panov} Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 6. Nf3 Be7 {the position has a similar style and feel as in the Queens gambit declined. } 7. cxd5 exd5 {this is a slight edge to black because he has a lead in development} 8. Bb5+ Nc6 9. Ne5 Qb6 10. Qa4 O-O {a very dynamic defence that leads to very active play for black. This is the beginning of a defensive tactic where black gives up both rooks for very active piece play which results in a won game by move 20. } 11. Nxc6 bxc6 {black is a bit awkward but I have calculated well and can see that I will be completely fine when when the dust settles.} 12. Bxc6 Ba6 {in exchange for the rook I gain superior piece play and attacking chances} 13. Bxa8 Rxa8 {the resulting position after the exchange is that black is better because he has a major lead in development and piece mobility} 14. f3 {preventing ...Ne4} Rc8 {with the idea to play Rc4 with a massive edge} 15. Qd1 Bd6 {increases the influence of the bishop and denying white an good developing square on f4} 16. Qd2 {an awkward move that will make white's position worse} Rc4 {taking advantage of the awkwardly placed queen} 17. Qf2 Rxd4 18. Be3 Be5 {Black gives up his second rook but the trade is good for black because the bishop pair will rule the board} 19. Bxd4 Bxd4 20. Qc2 Be3 {preventing white from castling queen side which keeps the rooks out of the game. } 21. Nd1 Bg5 22. g3 Nd7 {preparing an escape avenue for the bishop} 23. f4 Be7 {The bishop is well positioned to join in the king hunt that is about to begin in haste} 24. Kd2 {attempting to activate the rook} d4 25. Kc1 d3 {I love these pawn moves because they feel like daggers being twisted in the heart} 26. Qg2 Bb7 27. Qf1 Nc5 28. h3 d2+ 29. Kxd2 Ne4+ 30. Kc2 Qc5+ 31. Nc3 Nxc3 32. bxc3 Be4+ 33. Kd2 Qd5+ 34. Ke1 Bd3 35. Qf2 Bc5 36. Qh2 Qe4+ 37. Kd1 Be3 38. a4 Bc4 {}
