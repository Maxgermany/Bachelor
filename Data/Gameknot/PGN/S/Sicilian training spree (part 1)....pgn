1. e4 c5 {in the first round, I tossed this game: the strongest opponent in the field, with Black...} 2. d4 {this one is not mocking about: kill the Sicilian as fast as you can; this player knows the dangers...} g6 {not impressed so far: after, dxc5, Qa5+, Black always wins the pawn back...} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Bd3 {belonging to the d2-d4 spectrum: White wants to castle fast, to make the center advantage count...} e6 {preparing d5, as always...} 5. dxc5 Qa5+ 6. c3 {I would have preferred Nc3...} Qxc5 7. Be3 Qc7 8. O-O Ne7 9. Nbd2 {developing...} O-O 10. Qc2 {completing development...} d5 11. exd5 exd5 12. c4 {hoping for dxc4...} Be6 13. cxd5 Qxc2 14. Bxc2 Bxd5 {Black still needs to complete development: but has found a forcing tempo; pawn b2 is uncovered...} 15. Bd4 {the only way, to cover pawn b2; Rb1 is way to passive...} Nbc6 {I had been thinking about a direct Bxf3, Nxf3, but I prefer to keep the tensions...} 16. Bc3 {both White and Black, have to find a way to develop their Rooks: in my opinion, this is not helping White...} Bxc3 17. bxc3 Na5 18. Rfe1 Nec6 19. Rab1 b6 20. Ba4 Rfc8 {Bxa2 looks tempting: never waste a good threat...} 21. Rb2 {White got the message...} Nc4 22. Nxc4 Bxc4 23. Bb3 Bxb3 24. Rxb3 Na5 {the White Rook wound up, in the wrong place...} 25. Rbb1 Nc4 26. Re4 Nd6 27. Rd4 Nf5 28. Rd3 Rc5 29. Rbd1 Rac8 {the smoke has cleared, somewhat: Whites' problem is clear; the Queen side pawns are not connected, and the Black King cannot be mated...} 30. Ng5 h6 31. Ne4 Re5 {Black has to look out for Nd6...} 32. Nd6 Nxd6 33. Rd3xd6 Rce8 {that trade, did not go well for White: Black is threatening mate...} 34. g3 Re5e2 35. Rd6d2 {not the way, to defend this: but also Rxa7 does not work; White cannot allow Rxa2, followed by R8e2...} Re2e1+ 36. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 37. Kg2 Rc1 {caught...} 38. Rd3 Rc2 39. a3 a5 {a tough position for White...} 40. Kf3 Kg7 41. Rd6 Rxc3+ 42. Kg4 {White sacs a pawn for play...} h5+ 43. Kh3 {at least, the f-pawn can be played now...} Rxa3 44. Rxb6 f6 45. f4 Ra4 {White has to fight for a draw...} 46. Rb7+ Kh6 47. Rb8 g5 48. Rb6 gxf4 49. Rxf6+ Kg7 50. Rf5 {a costly mistake...} Kg6 51. Rxf4 {letting f4 live, is also lethal after fxg3...} Rxf4 52. gxf4 a4 {White resigned...}
