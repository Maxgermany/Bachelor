[Opening "King's pawn game (C20)"]

1. e4 {My favorite first move.} e5 {He responds normally.} 2. g3 {I was trying something new, so I decided to play g3 early.} Nc6 {He opens up his knight, protecting his pawn from any threats.} 3. Bg2 {I get my bishop out of the way for castling.} Nf6 {He opens up his other knight - what I would usually do.} 4. Nf3 {I decided to try to persuade him to take my pawn then threaten his knight repeatedly, but…} a5 {…He doesn't take my pawn, but instead pushes up his pawn on the wing up two squares, something that I think is pointless.} 5. d4 {I threaten his pawn on e5 while being protected by my knight on f3 and my queen.} d6 {He protects his pawn using another one of his pawns.} 6. O-O {I castle.} g6 {He pushes up his pawn, same as I did on my second move.} 7. Re1 {I protect my pawn with my rook.} Be6 {He opens up his bishop. I do this often.} 8. d5 {I fork his knight and bishop with my pawn. :D} Nd4 {He threatens my knight, but it's easier for me to take his bishop with my pawn rather then taking the knight.} 9. dxe6 {I take his bishop.} Nxf3+ {He takes my knight with his own, and I am now in check.} 10. Bxf3 {I take his knight.} fxe6 {And he takes my free pawn. But notice that the other pawn is right in front of him. Now both of his e can't move anywhere.} 11. Nc3 {I open my knight… Finally.} b6 {He pushes up his pawn one square.} 12. Be3 {I open up my other bishop. Now both my bishops and my knight are mobile and have a fair amount of space to move around in.} Rg8 {Not a great move. It isn't doing anything except preventing him from castling, unless he wants to open up his rook.} 13. Bg5 {I pin the knight with my bishop.} h6 {He threatens me with a pawn.} 14. Bxf6 {And I take his knight.} Qxf6 {He takes me back.} 15. Nb5 {I threaten: Nc7.} O-O-O {He castles, but now I see something else, a possibility… 16. Na7+ Kb8 17. Nc6+! Forking the knight and rook!} 16. Na7+ {I attempt my plan…} Kb8 {…And it works!! :D} 17. Nc6+ {I fork his king and rook!} Kc8 {He moves his king out of the way and I happily capture his rook.} 18. Nxd8 {Yay!} Qxd8 {He takes my knight, but now I'm plus 4 up with two rooks!} 19. c3 {I push up my pawn.} h5 {And he pushes up his own.} 20. b4 {I threaten his a-pawn while being protected by my c-pawn.} Be7 {He ignores the threat and prepares to open up his bishop.} 21. Qa4 {Now I'm really threatening his pawn. } h4 {But again, he ignores it!} 22. bxa5 {I take the pawn…} hxg3 {…And he takes mine.} 23. fxg3 {…I take his…} g5 {…And he doesn't take mine!} 24. Be2 {Now I'm planning: 25. axb6 cxb6 26. Qa8+ Kd7 27. Bb5+} g4 {He pushes up his pawn again and now my plan can work.} 25. axb6 {I take his pawn…} cxb6 {…And he takes mine! Perfect!} 26. Qa8+ {The plan is working…} Kd7 {Yes!} 27. Bb5+ {Yes!!} Kc7 {This is good.} 28. Qa7+ {I check him with my queen, ignoring the queen swap.} Kc8 {YAY!!! Checkmate in one move.} 29. Ba6# {I checkmate him with my bishop, my queen blocking his escape routes. :) Believe it or not, I didn't actually checkmate him here in the blitz game. I actually played: Bc4! :D But then I won his rook and he reigned. Apart from not checkmating him in the blitz game, that was a great game! }
