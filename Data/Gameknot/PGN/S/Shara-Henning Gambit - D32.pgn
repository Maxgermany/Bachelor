1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 c5 4. cxd5 cxd4 {The schara henning gambit i don't recommand it with black in long games} 5. Qa4+ {equivalent to Qxd4} Bd7 {the strongest, but Qd7 is also possible} 6. Qxd4 exd5 7. Qxd5 Nc6 {Nf6 is not possible yet (Qxb7)} 8. Nf3 Nf6 9. Qd1 {4 queen moves in the 9 first white moves ; that is the point black will try to point out. Qb3 have also been tried, but Qd1 seems stronger. white have one pawn advance, but all this is the main theorical line } Bc5 10. e3 Qe7 {black have fully developed their pieces.  Qe2 is a strong move that allows: black to O-O or O-O-O, avoid e4, protects the bishop !  anyway, e4 for white must be played very carefully white moves have to be precise, because black have a superior development.} 11. Be2 O-O-O {O-O ! is perhaps stronger, but practically, O-O-O offers good chances to black in short games.} 12. a3 {this move have been played in long game, but i prefer O-O} Bh3 {fritz proposes here Nd2 here, keeping the pawn} 13. Qc2 Bxg2 14. Rg1 Bxf3 15. Bxf3 Nd4 {an interesting suite. fritz 9  0.34 for black  the thematic move is Ne5} 16. Qd1 Rhe8 {g7 pawn is not takeable (Nf5)} 17. Kf1 Nxf3 18. Qxf3 g6 19. b4 Bb6 {or Bd6} 20. Ra2 {a strange way to develop Queen side pieces  } Qe6 21. Rc2 Qb3 {Qb3 !} 22. Qe2 {fritz find also this move with  0.84 for black} Kb8 23. Bb2 Rdc8 {c3 knight cannot move.  c2 is very week, due to a bad organisation} 24. Rc1 Bc7 25. Kg2 Nh5 {musch better was Be5 . but i wanted to start my attack at king side by f5. anyway the knight is unactive there} 26. Qc2 Qe6 {black have a space advantage} 27. Kh1 f5 28. Qa4 {Qa4 ? blocking the a pawn.  0.91 for black } Qe5 {unuseful move ! } 29. Rg2 Bb6 {avoiding attacks with Nb5  } 30. Qd1 Red8 31. Qc2 {still  0.81 for black ... } Qe6 32. Rgg1 f4 {thats it !} 33. Qe4 { 1.31 for black} Qb3 34. Qc2 Qxc2 {keeping the weakness on c2 } 35. Rxc2 { 1.31 for black} fxe3 36. fxe3 Bxe3 {black are realizing a full pawn.} 37. Re1 {a very difficult decision but rook f1 was a little bit stronger, becasue of the black response  1.50 for black} Rd2 {Rd2 ! the rook and the bishop are not takeable !} 38. Re2 Rxc2 39. Rxc2 {the c2 weekness is still there ! the white pieces have not progressed and have  the same configuration as move 23 !} Bd4 40. Rc1 Nf4 41. Nd1 {Nd1 ??  the following black move forces resignation. can you find it ?} Re8 {Re1 !! ( 2.88 for black)} 42. Bxd4 Re1+ 43. Bg1 Ne2 {happy christmas !}
