1. e4 {One of my friends suggested me some other chess game site with some new interface which obviously was confusing for me. I was NOT interested to play as I wanted to leave for some work but was just checking some options and by mistake landed up accepting a 5 min blitz game. Now I am a very slow player and need lots of time. And plus I was in a hurry but then didnt want to lose my first ever game! So I played this game. However I won because of blunder(s) by opponent but I am more excited because of rapid moves (thoughts) I made. (again, I am very bad at rapid chess!)} Nc6 {Please flip the board and see the game from black's angle!  I planned to play defensively and moved knight.} 2. d4 {Opponent takes initiative and centre!} g6 {to get bishop on g7} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Bc4 {aiming on f7 with Ng5} e6 {defended} 5. d5 {attacking knight and wanting to break defence of f7} Na5 {i switched to offensive and attacked unprotected bishop} 6. Bb3 {opponent wanted to continue attack line and expected me not to take bishop} Nxb3 {but bishop was getting strong so better to take it} 7. axb3 Nf6 {ready to castle} 8. Nbd2 O-O 9. c4 {strengthening the center further.. probably opponent wanted me to attack first} exd5 {aiming to break white's hold on center i attacked ...white seemed to be playing too defensive} 10. cxd5 d6 {to stop move to e5 and open the way for bishop} 11. O-O Re8 {try to take control of e file} 12. Re1 {to defend e4 pawn} Bg4 {somehow i didnt want f3 knight to come into play so pinned it} 13. h3 {go away bishop!} Bxf3 {nah! i want to marry ur knight to death!} 14. gxf3 {?!!! bombed and broke its own castle! white king is now all alone and unprotected.  white should have taken black bishop with knight or queen} Qd7 {lets give opponent king a company!  "Hello h3! Can i meet your king?"} 15. Qe2 {"sure why not! i am at your service!"  it appears white overlooked the attack on h3 and was planning to push e4 pawn.  or was he planning on something else?} Qxh3 {nice toffee!} 16. f4 {?!!! what? suicide?!! probably white wanted to further strengthen push to e5.  Too much defensive play.} Ng4 {watchout or mate in two!} 17. Nf3 {white now realised that i am too close to comfort!} Bd4 {this is the masterstroke! bishop at its best! maximum squares covered!  white atleast losses pawn and queen for bishop and knight, the threat is:  18 ...  Bxf2  19 Qxf2 (forced) Nxf2 with black queen on rampage, further damage was imminent.  if 18 Nxd4 18 ... Qh2  19 Kf1 Qh1#} 18. Be3 {white blocks the path to f2} Rxe4 {rook makes thumping entry into enemy barracks!  funny!! black's single rook rules 'e file' against white's queen and rook!  black also has option to play defensive and send backups with Rae8 before starting final assault} 19. Bxd4 {but white resigns immediately after playing Bxd4  queen and then knight were up for grabs!  hope you enjoyed my first annotated game! thanks for reading!}
