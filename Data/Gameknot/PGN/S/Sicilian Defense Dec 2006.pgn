1. e4 c5 {The purpose of this annotation is not to explain the book moves...any book on Sicilian openings will do a much better job than I.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {I will note that this move indicates black's intentions to play the Dragon, which IMHO is the most logical way to play the Sicilian Defense as black... Najdorf fans may disagree!} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 {This move by white preceeded by the queenside bishop on e3 confirms white's intentions to play the Yugoslav Attack.. experts will say the best test of the Dragon, certainly bringing the most excitement to the board.} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 9. O-O-O {All by the book so far, although Bc4 can also be expected here.} d5 {The queenside castle allows this move.. I think anything else leads to a gain of tempo by white.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bd4 {Positional approach.. offering a trade of bishops, something that black does not have to accept.} e5 13. Bc5 Be6 {Typical offer of sacrifice here.. all by the book.} 14. Ne4 Rb8 15. Bc4 f5 16. Ng5 e4 {So far these are all standard book moves, something that you can reference in any game database. Chessbase 2004 has 9 games to this point.. with white winning 7 of them!} 17. Nxe6 {Now this is different, for I was counting on a continuation of the line we were on, which would be Bb3. The capture of the light squared bishop, and the three pronged attack on queen, rook, and bishop look so menacing that it would seem black has made a serious error of judgement, but how could that be, since book moves had been followed all the way. I look for a possible solution, and find the only move black has to avoid a serious loss of material.} Bxb2+ {This is the only move black can make. It puts the white king in check and eliminates the loss of material, at least for the time being.} 18. Kb1 {Forced.} Nc3+ {Another check to white's king, and ethansiegal and I are on the way to an exciting finish.} 19. Qxc3 {Again, white is forced into this move.} Bxc3+ {The capture of white's queen leads to the discovered check by the rook on b8.} 20. Kc1 {The third forced move in a row by white.} Qf6 {I wish I could say that black had a brilliant mate here, but there is none that I could see. I am simply attempting to save my queen with this move, nothing more. If anyone can see something better here, please let me know.} 21. Nxf8+ {A move which I had prevented with 17... Bxb2 , but now can do little to stop. A nice discovered check as well.} Kh8 {Black's only sane move. (Kg7 allows 22. Rd7 ... Kh6  23. R xh7 ... Kg5) and who knows what after that!} 22. Rd7 {Now this is the move that in a roundabout way leads to black's surprise resignation. I had made mention of this game at the local chess club, and had foolishly put this move on the board, when our first board, who had been following along.. pipes up after a few minutes... "That's incorrect", and goes on to demonstrate that black can force a mate in  6 or 7 moves. I didn't bother to take notes at this point, knowing that I had just received some expert advice on a game in progress.. a very definite no-no. I didn't bother asking him what the correct move was for white, and didn't mention that I was still playing this game, from fear of being stoned by the membership! I do remember he mentioned Qg5  starts the mating sequence, and later that night that is the move I played next.} Qg5+ {Feeling slightly ashamed of myself... I proceed.} 23. f4 Qxf4+ {The mating sequence becomes clearer as I take the f pawn for another check.} 24. Kd1 Qg4+ {I've got it straight by now.. 25.Kc1... Qg5   26. Kd1... Rb1   27. Ke2... Q x g2   28. Bf2... Qf3 mate} 25. Kc1 {But I cannot continue. I had received advice, although unsolicited, about a game in progress, and although I may have figured this out on my own, I may not have. The beautiful game had become tainted, so I decided to resign and tell my  opponent why. He suggested that I annotate the game, and I have done so. The lesson to be learned of course is never discuss an active game... wait until it's finished.}
