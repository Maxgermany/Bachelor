1. e4 {[%clk 0:05:01] } d5 {[%clk 0:05:02] } 2. exd5 {[%clk 0:05:03] } Nf6 {[%clk 0:05:06] } 3. d4 {[%clk 0:05:03] Not the most common answer, but one of the best.  } e6 {[%clk 0:05:09] Icelandic, my favourite.  } 4. dxe6 {[%clk 0:05:02] } Bxe6 {[%clk 0:05:13] The point is black has two developed pieces and white none. It is actually not such a great advantage, though, and has to be handled carefully. I didn't.  } 5. Bg5 {[%clk 0:05:02] } Nbd7 {[%clk 0:05:14] Not forced still to employ the dsb on e7. I like it on d6. Now white can go d5, and if Bxd5, QxB, NxQ, BxQ, and black has Nb4 as a threat, forcing Bd6, NxB, cxN, after which black has still RxBd8 and is in good shape.  } 6. Nf3 {[%clk 0:05:00] } Bd6 {[%clk 0:05:07] Where I want it. Of course white can reject it with c4-c5. Two tempos, and I can still go c6 and Bb4+. } 7. Bd3 {[%clk 0:04:47] I would say this is too passive. } h6 {[%clk 0:05:09] I plan all the way to castle queenside, so I'm not scared in opening the kingside. By playing this, I accept Bh4, g5 and the risky piece per two pawns sac. A fun game, the result difficult to predict. I also accept Bg3, and I will answer Qe7 and leave the exchange to him.  } 8. Be3 {[%clk 0:04:45] Does this look like a bad move? } c6 {[%clk 0:05:12] Sticking to my plan.  } 9. O-O {[%clk 0:04:48] Thank you white. Can you see you are inviting me? } Qc7 {[%clk 0:05:15] } 10. h3 {[%clk 0:04:49] c4 was strongly needed, in order to force the deployment of my dsb (I'll go to f4 in case of c5). This is a mistake, even fearing Ng4, because it opens the way to my g pawn.  } O-O-O {[%clk 0:05:14] Maybe too slow, but hey, I'm losing too many games no to be a little wiser.  } 11. c3 {[%clk 0:04:45] ?? c4 was definitely needed. I later understood his plan, that is to open the way for his Q to a4, threatening a7. This plan will prove to be a frustrating one for white. Let's see why.  } g5 {[%clk 0:05:17] Last chance for white to "open the umbrella". g4 is threatened, opening the K's shield.  } 12. Qa4 {[%clk 0:04:24] White bets for the counterattack. Who will get a deathly threat before? Now, when the game is like this, you have to give sooo much importance to tempoes. In this particular case, even after Qxa7, Qa8+, I have essentially nothing to fear in the short term. } g4 {[%clk 0:05:07] So I go on with my attack, ignoring his! A breach in pawns or a piece, white: choose! } 13. hxg4 {[%clk 0:03:59] A deadly breach is opened in white king's front. Now: which one should take? N or B?  } Bxg4 {[%clk 0:04:46] The idea is that this B will be backed by a R, threatening the N. White's marvelous B pair is almost useless! } 14. Ne5 {[%clk 0:03:54] What else? Kh1 was a chance to bring in the R on g1. Would you say black has an edge here... ? :-) } Nxe5 {[%clk 0:04:47] } 15. dxe5 {[%clk 0:03:57] } Bxe5 {[%clk 0:04:49] Threatening Bd3 by the way.  } 16. Bc2 {[%clk 0:03:02] What else? } Rdg8 {[%clk 0:04:46] Why not the other R? I thought I had to avoid Bxh6 to ensure my dominion on the g file. I was wrong, in fact Bxh6 guarantees me the win.  } 17. Qxa7 {[%clk 0:03:00] White still underestimates the danger. } Bf3 {[%clk 0:04:26] "Incidentally", this covers Ra1+. It does allow Bf4+. But, incredibly this is not a problem due to white's Nb1, which prevents white to connect R.  } 18. g3 {[%clk 0:01:55] The last mistake, what else? } Bxg3 {[%clk 0:04:24] Not even calculating it.  } 19. Bf5+ {[%clk 0:01:34] } Kd8 {[%clk 0:04:21] Not Nd7. It covers d7. But in playing this, I invited (with some malice, I admit) my opponent in playing... } 20. Bb6 {[%clk 0:01:31] "Oooooohhhhh!" makes the lady "my hero is in danger" :-D but I reply: "Don't worry, baby, just relax and look..." } Bf4+ {[%clk 0:03:53] Is this a beauty or not? I know, not a big deal, but "live" it is nice to have found it.  } 21. Bg4 {[%clk 0:01:12] } Rxg4# {[%clk 0:03:56] }
