[Opening "Robatsch defence (A41), Rossolimo variation"]

1. e4 g6 {Unlike yours truly, who is old-fashioned, my opponent is a "modern" man.} 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 {I preferred this to Nc3, because: it controls squares that are attacked by the Bishop on g7, it provides extra protection to d4, and it allows me to support d4 with c3 if needed.} c6 {Expecting ... d6, this move already put me out of book, so I had to improvise. I'm guessing the point of this move is to support d7-d5 and allow the Queen to attack my pawns from b6.} 4. Bd3 {Without much knowledge on the Modern defence, I decided I should just take my big center, castle as quickly as possible, and only then start worrying about a plan.} d6 5. O-O Bg4 {Here, I obviously have to do something about the d4 pawn.} 6. c3 e5 {My opponent is giving me a chance to open up the game when his King is still in the center, so I should definitely seize this oppportunity.} 7. dxe5 dxe5 8. h3 {"What 'cha gonna do?" Harry asked the Bishop.} Bxf3 9. Qxf3 {I expected Black to try trading Queens and go into an endgame, but my Queen just chills here for the rest of the game and lets the underlings do the dirty work.} Nd7 10. Be3 {The bishops have excellent range.} Ngf6 11. Nd2 O-O 12. Rad1 {With only my rooks left to develop, I should take over the one open file.} Qe7 13. Bc2 {Anticipating the Knight to come to c5.} Nc5 14. b4 {Now I start seizing space on the Queenside.} Ne6 15. Nc4 {This prevents ... a5 and my knight will soon find a dominant outpost.} Nh5 {I'll be in trouble if a Knight lands on f4 ...} 16. g3 {After this, the Knight on rim got stuck there for the rest of the game.} b6 {Black cannot allow my Bishop to reach c5.} 17. Rd2 c5 18. b5 {Bilbo Baggins has invaded the Queenside!} Nd4 {I actually expected this shot. It's Black's only try for the initiative, otherwise he will continue to be squeezed.} 19. cxd4 cxd4 {Here, I decided I should let Black capture my dark-squared Bishop, which has a bleak future in the position.} 20. Nxe5 {My opponent admitted that he did not see this tactical shot. The idea is the intermediate move Nc6 if he captures the bishop. On the other hand, if he captures the knight, he'll be a pawn dawn and his dark squares will be weak after Bxd4.} dxe3 21. Nc6 Qg5 {... Qc5 was a better try} 22. Rd5 {White has already dominated the Queenside. Now all that's left is to invade on the Kingside.} exf2+ 23. Kg2 {I didn't want to take the pawn immediately because of ... f5} Qh6 {If Black instead had gone ... Qf6, the endgame would be hopeless after Rxf2.} 24. e5 {I'm in no hurry to recapture the pawn. I need to prevent the Knight to get back into the game via Nf6.} Rae8 25. Bb3 {Apparently, Rxf2 first was more accurate after an engine check, but this is also winning.} Kh8 26. Rxf2 {Here, Black must try for counterplay with the plan f7-f5-f4.} f6 27. e6 {The pawn is immune due to the discovered attack Rxh5.} f5 {Black lost a precious tempo one move earlier.} 28. e7 {As Nimzowitsch said, "Passed pawns must be pushed."}
