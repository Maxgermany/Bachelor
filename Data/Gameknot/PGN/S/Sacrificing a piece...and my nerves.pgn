[Opening "King's pawn game (C50)"]

1. e4 {Time to annotate a game I won for a change. I am not a confident attacker and even less confident when making sacrifices so this game was a little nerve-wracking for me.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 h6 {Moves like this are what it takes for me to try to attack out of the opening, because if I let someone get away with it, then how grievous could such a waste of time really be?} 4. d4 exd4 5. c3 {The GÃ¶ring Gambit of the Scotch Game goes 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3. Its goal, like the goal of many gambits, is (at least in part) to gain a lead in development. Because White already has a lead in development thanks to each side's third move, I overcame my aversion to giving away pawns in the opening, with, ideally, an even greater lead in development as compensation.} dxc3 6. Nxc3 Bb4 {At some point here the Game Database comes into play. Here Black picks the most common move in this position.} 7. O-O {As do I in this position.} Nge7 {The position after White's 7th move is in the World database precisely once, but has been reached nearly 100 times on Gameknot. 7...Bxc3 is most popular here. Black's actual move is played more often than the knight to f6, but I'm not sure why. } 8. Nd5 Bd6 {This is a move I really suspect of being attributable to the database. Even though 8...Bd6 is only in the database twice, Black won both times. However, I don't see how it can be good as it blocks the d-pawn.} 9. Re1 {I leave the database here (earlier games saw 9. Be3 and 9. e5). This move discourages 9...Nxd5.} Ne5 {Black has a lot of potential exchanges on the table now, and each exchange helps Black. I'm starting to get pretty nervous already.} 10. Nxe5 Bxe5 11. f4 Bd6 12. Qg4 Rg8 {12...O-O 13. Nf6+ just seems terrible for Black, so he avoids castling. But he is many moves from being able to castle queenside--four, at the very least. This should give White time to build up even more of an attack.} 13. f5 {Opening the dark-squared bishop's diagonal. Even though White has quite a bit of time now before Black can get his king to safety, I'm still feeling bad about this. For one thing, where are the open lines to Black's king?} Be5 14. Bf4 d6 {Obviously not 14...Bxb2 when 15. Bxc7 traps the Black queen ignominiously. } 15. Bxe5 dxe5 {And here White has the "safe" 16. Rad1 or the more violent...} 16. Nf6+ {Is it good? Probably not. However, this may be the only chance to play this sacrifice--16...Nc6 was on the table.} gxf6 17. Qh5 {Threatening mate.} Rf8 {Black only has two options here, and picks what must be the wrong one. I expected 17...Rg7 when I made the knight sacrifice, and was planning 18. Qxh6 Rg8 (or Kf8) 19. Qxf6 here. I think White has some play there, otherwise I'm not playing 16. Nf6+ at all, but when Black played this move instead, I began to feel a lot better.} 18. Rad1 Bd7 {Now Black demonstrates a stubborn unwillingness to give up the queen. While there is no way to do so and stay ahead in material, it would have resulted in an endgame where Black has a rook and knight for it and might still be able to put some play together.} 19. Be6 {I like this move. I saw it after 17...Rf8.} Qb8 {This is the really stubborn move to save the queen, but it looks absolutely silly hiding over there on b8. If Black goes with 19...Bxe6 20. Rxd8+ Kxd8 21. fxe6 fxe6 22. Qxh6, it's that losing endgame again, but it's not completely hopeless.} 20. Bxd7+ Kd8 {A stalemated king is never good; even worse when the queen is trapped with nothing to do; and even worse when one rook is stalemated and the other staring at doubled pawns on its file.} 21. Qxh6 Rg8 22. Qxf6 {Black resigns. He could still play on with 22...c5, which loses a piece but is the only move that doesn't lead to instant annihilation. One variation (hardly forced) that I would very much have enjoyed playing through to the end was 22... c6 23. Be6+ Kc7 24. Qxe7+ Kb6 25. Qb4+ Ka6 26. Re3 b5 27. Ra3+ Kb6 28. Qa5+ Kb7 29. Rd7+ Kc8 30. Rxf7# - but the position of Black's king and queen in the actual final position is amusing enough.}
