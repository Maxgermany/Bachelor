[Opening "Philidor (C41), Hanham, Krause variation"]

1. e4 {Team match. For my white game, I open with the King's Pawn.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {Philidor's Defense, an irregular defense where black's queen's pawn push to d6 defends his KP and frees his QB, though blocking his KB and allowing white some ground in the centre. I respond with the main line, staking my claim on the center.} Nd7 4. Bc4 {Nd7 is a traditional Hanham move, marking this as the Hanham variation of the Philidor. The advantage is defense of e5 while ensuring that trading pawns in the center doesn't give white an opportunity to exchange queens..} Nb6 5. Bb3 {The experts recommend 4. ... c6 to prepare 5. ... b5 or 5. ... Qa5 . Alternatively, 4. Be7 is also recommended, though generally accepted as inferior to 4. ... c6. As played, black's 4th move strayed from my limited opening library, so it's off to uncharted territory I go. Well, at least I don't have the chart...} Qe7 6. O-O {Black's 5th move baffled me. I don't know what he thought to gain, other than maybe security against a queen exchange if the pawns trade off in the center. And he blocks in his king's bishop. Or maybe he had is eye on taking the e4 pawn after he plays 6. ... exd4, though that is foiled easily enough, and the simple expedience of castling handles this rather effortlessly, and develops the king's rook in the process.} f5 7. dxe5 {Now black is attacking the center. I am agreeable. Perhaps chopping up the center will open an avenue for my rook to skewer his queen on e7. Besides, I'm fairly certain to at least win a pawn here.} fxe4 8. exd6 cxd6 9. Nc3 {It seems black's center pawns have overextended their reach, and the e-pawn is sure to fall, leaving the lonely d-pawn isolated and faced with inevitable doom.} Nf6 10. Bg5 {The obvious pin, eliminating one of the pawn's defenders by pinning the knight on f6 to the queen. The other defender, the queen herself, is only an illusory defender - if she sticks her neck out by capturing on e4, then white skewers her and wins her with Re1.} Qd8 11. Nxe4 {Black's 10th move spared him any worries about being skewered by the rook, but it maintains the white pin on his knight at f6. Hence the e4 pawn is ripe for the plucking, and in the nick of time, too, since it's poised to bring swift demise to the white knight on f3.} Be7 12. Bxf6 {A pawn ahead, I am more than willing to liquidate pieces. I expect black to recapture with his bishop, then another exchange will follow with 13. Nxf6.} gxf6 13. Re1 {Black spared himself a second exchange, at the expense of his kingside pawn structure. 13. Re1 indirectly pins the black bishop to his king, leaving the pawn on f6 undefended if I capture it with the knight at e4.} Kf8 14. Nd4 {The knight was in the way, he had to go somewhere, might as well threaten a fork on e6, though that space is sufficiently defended at the moment.} d5 15. Qh5 {Threatens mate in 1 if black is foolish enough to play 15. ... dxe4. I suppose black is feeling the pressure of being attacked by 5 pieces while he only has 1 defender developed (the distant knight on b6 is little help at the moment).} Nc4 16. Nc3 {If 16. ... Nxb2, then 17. Bxd5 threatens mate in 1. Black cannot reply 17. ... Qf8 because of 18. Qh6  . On 17. ... Kg7 black crates an escape hatch and white cannot immediately force checkmate, but after 18. Qf7  Kh6 19. Rxe7 black's goose is properly cooked. White is threatening multiple checkmates and multiple pawns will fall if black can find some way to avoid mate.} Bb4 17. Nxd5 {Black evidently felt that counterattacking was the best defense. He probably thought his move pinned the knight at c3. If nothing else, he seems to have created an escape hatch for his king at f7 - which I promptly close for him, as well as capturing a pawn and threatening the bishop on b4 - all of which is obvious and none of which is the main reason behind the move.} Bxe1 18. Qh6+ {Black took the bait. Time to justify the sacrifice. Black could run with 18. ... Ke8 but that allows white to cpature the bishop on e1 with check and a tempo, bringing another piece to bear on the fleeing king. One such continuation might be: 19. Rxe1  Kd7 20. Nxf6  Kd6 21. Ne8  Kd7 22. Ba4  b5 23. Bxb5# } Kf7 19. Bxc4 {Black chose to huddle up and try to weather the storm. After 19. Bxc4 black can try to save his bishop, say with Ba5??? but then mate is forced with 20. Nxf6  Ke7 21. Qg7  Kd6 22. Ne4# (black can sacrifice his queen and bishop to stall, in which case it takes a bit longer, but mate is equally inevitable).} Bxf2+ 20. Kxf2 {Black stalls, but nothing is changed.} Be6 21. Nxe6 {Black stopped the immediate mate, but he is still exposed and attacked from all sides, with his only defenders still on their starting squares. This can only end one way.} Kxe6 22. Nxf6+ {Now the exposed king has nowhere to hide. White has a significant material lead, so black dare not step onto the d-file with his king, for Rd1 will skewer and win the black queen, and while black may eventually flee to temporary safety on the queenside, his material shortcoming would ensure a hopeless endgame.} Kf5 23. Bd3+ {So exposed. So cold. So lonely. The three pieces closest to the black king all want his head.} Qxd3 24. cxd3 {Black's move was desperate, and it staves off immediate mate, but it appears he still had some running room, though just about any line I try ends in checkmate or winning black's queen. Or both.} Raf8 25. Re1 {Black's king needed to flee. Now he is trapped between a queen and a hard place. His only escape from imminent mate is (either)Rg8, but then he loses both rooks and immediately after loses the game, for example, 25. ... Rhg8 26. Nxg8 Rxg8 27. Qe6  Kf4 28. Re4  Kg5 29. Rg4  Kh5 30. Qxg8 h6 31. Qg6#. 25. ... Re8 is no better, for white checkmates even faster, and with a pawn: 26. Nxe8 Rxe8 27. Rxe8 a5 28. Kf3 b5 29. g4#.} Rxf6 26. Qh5+ {Black took the bait, and now it's mate in two.} Kf4 27. Re4# {Final position.}
