[Opening "Levitsky attack (Queen's bishop attack) (D00)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Bg5 {Trompowski Attack.  This line is quite distant from the beaten track, and can lead to some bizarre-looking positions.  Eccentric as it is, the 'normal' rules for the placement of pieces and pawns don't always apply in this sort of game.} Nc6 {Reasonable developing move.  Black has plenty of other options.} 3. e3 {Solid.  Also playable was 3.Nf3 - the Torre Attack.} f6 {In many popular openings, this sort of move doesn't get played at all.  But here is is fine: chasing the bishop and planning to establish a strong centre.} 4. Bf4 {Also playable was Bh4, but this is fine.} e5 {Building a broad pawn centre at once.  Now you can see the real purpose of ...f6.} 5. dxe5 fxe5 6. Bg3 {There is no mileage to be got from Qh5ch(?).} e4 {I will be honest here, and state that I do not know about this move.  My instinct suggests the pawns should be kept level (for the time being anyhow), keeping the g3-bishop locked up, and retaining a certain strategic flexibility.  Yet this advance does have its points: control of d3 and f3, and a slight crimp in White's K-side.  It's a judgement call.} 7. Nc3 {Striking the d5-pawn.} Be6 {Defending the d5-pawn.  Possibly 7...Nf6 was marginally the better option, but there isn't all that much in it.} 8. Nh3 {In view of black's response, maybe Nge2 was the better option, still with the idea of Nf4 at some point.  Possibly White wanted to keep open the diagonal for the f1-bishop.  In that case, she might instead have played 8.Bb5, with 9.Nge2 to follow.  The line might have gone 8.Bb5 a6  9.Ba4 ... (9.Bxc6!? might tend to suit Black better) 9...Nf6  10.Nge2.  White can then follow with Bb3 and Nf4, adding to the pressure against Black's d-pawn.} Bxh3 {A very interesting strategic decision.  For the 'minor exchange', Black doubles and isolates White's h-pawn, and generally mauls White' K-side structure.  But White need not in fact have allowed her K-side to be so mutilated.  See next...} 9. gxh3 {The obvious move, and just what Black was aiming for.  But White could instead have played 9.Qh5ch g6  10.Qxh3.  It is unlikely that Black would obtain anything but trouble after 10...d4? 11.exd4 and then 11...Nxd4 12.0-0-0 or 11...Qxd4  12.Rd1.} Nf6 10. Bg2 {One might have preferred 10.Bb5, but by placing pressure against the Black centre in this way, White inhibits the advance of the Black d-pawn.} g6 {This really is justified only if Black plans ...Bg7 to follow.  Otherwise is is simply a weakening move if (and when) Black castles on this wing.  Preferable seems ...Be7, or, better yet, ...Bb4.  After, say, 10...Bb4 11.0-0 Bxc3 12.bxc3, White would have been left with a mangled pawn structure right across the board.  The bishop pair and open files might not have compensated sufficiently for all the weaknesses incurred.} 11. Qd2 Bb4 {Not so good, now, despite the 'double' pin (the knight is pinned against K and Q on the same diagonal).  White can drive the bishop off, or if Black does exchange, White gets to preserve the integrity of her Q-side.} 12. a3 Bxc3 13. Qxc3 O-O 14. O-O-O {The situation looks to be slightly favourable for White.  Black's K-side is looking very porous, and White has the potential for developing a strong K-side attack: the open g-file; the weak dark squares, and the target sitting on g6, at which White's h-pawns might be aimed.  But it is Black to play...} Nh5 {[?] A mistake, and quite a serious one.  Black's centre is under such pressure from White bishops and rook, with the Queen doing its bit, that removing a vital prop must occasion its collapse.} 15. f3 {[?] Not merely a missed opportunity, this move transforms Black's mistake into a good move.  Instead 15.Bxe4 not only walked away with a pawn on account of the rook's pin on the d-file, but would have brought additional pressure against Black's centre and K-side.  E.g. 15.Bxe4 Nf6 16.Bd3 ... 17.Rag1.  } exf3 16. Bf1 {This must have been an annoying retreat, shutting in the King's Rook.} Nxg3 17. hxg3 Qf6 {Offering a pawn after the queens come off (18.Qxf6 Rxf6  19.Rxd5 ...).  Probably 17...Qg5 was the more promising, protecting the d-pawn, and eyeing White's g-pawn, not to mention the White King.} 18. Qd3 {Probably White was better advised to take the offered Q exchange and the pawn sweetener that came with it.  Having said that, White has made a judgement call that suggested 'keep the Queens on'.  In that case, 18.Qd2 looks the better option, keeping open the bishop's diagonal to b5 or c4 as occasion indicates.  It would also have saved a tempo in the game!} Rfd8 {Right idea, but this looks to be the wrong rook.  This is sometimes one of the hardest decisions to be found in chess: 'Which rook?' to place on a given file.  GM J.R. Capablanca lost his first game in defence of the World Championship against A. Alekhine through a mistaken choice.  Here, the a8-rook is not doing anything; the f8-rook is.  So ...Rad8 was indicated.} 19. Qd2 d4 {Good move: annihilating the remnants of White's centre.} 20. exd4 Rxd4 21. Qe1 Rxd1+ 22. Qxd1 Nd4 {Now seems to me a good time to have brought the rook into action: 22...Rd8.  It isn't doing anything on a8.} 23. Bc4+ Kg7 24. g4 {Unclear what the purpose of this move is.  But it is not easy for White to find useful moves about now anyway.  I might have considered 24.c3 instead.} Re8 {I like 24...Rd8, threatening ...Ne2ch or ...Nb3ch.} 25. Rf1 Qf4+ 26. Kb1 Rd8 27. Qe1 Kf8 {White was threatening 28.Qe7ch.  But placing the Q and K on the same line as the rook on f1 does have its risks...} 28. c3 {At the expense of weakening the light squares, White drives back the enemy knight.  This was a very good decision as after 28...Nc6 29.Qe6 White threatens to force a perpetual check.  If Black averts that by 29...Ne7 then 30.Qe2! wins back Black's dangerous passed pawn: 30...fxe2!? 31.Rxf4ch Ke8 32.Bxe2 (32.Bf7ch? leads nowhere if Black is sufficiently alert).  Instead, 29...Re8 30.Qg8ch Ke7 31.Qe6ch Kf8 (31...Kd8 32.Rd1ch and White wins) 32.Qg8ch (=).} Ne2 {[?] In fact ...Nc6 was forced.  With this move, Black should have lost knight and f-pawn both.  } 29. Rf2 {[?] Overlooking two ways to remove the pressure completely, along with Black's knight and passed pawn.  [A] 29.Bxe2 Re8 30.Qf2 Re3  (30...Rxe2 31.Qxe2 fxe2 32.Rxf4ch Kg7 33.Re4)  31.Qxf3 Rxf3  32.Rxf3 Qxf3  33.Bxf3.  Or, my personal choice [B] 29.Qxe2 fxe2  30.Rxf4ch Kg7 31.Bxe2.} Rd2 {[?] This should not have worked, but we'll come back to that.  The immediate question is, has Black overlooked the chance to win a piece?  After 29...Qxc4 30.Rxf3ch Kg7 31.Re3 ..., how is the knight to be defended?  The obvious move is 31...Nf4 32.Re7ch Kg8  33.Qe5 ... the threats by White's two active pieces look good enough to draw, but Black's pieces are also active: 33... Rd1ch 34.Kc2 Qd3ch  35.Kb3 Qd5ch!  By forcing the exchange of queens, Black could have retained the extra piece.  That was indeed a chance missed, though it would have required calculation 7 moves deep to determine - with trial and practice it becomes not too difficult a task for a forcing line like this.} 30. Bxe2 {Clever move, but incorrect, as it turns out.  The right move was 30.Rxf3! Qxf3 31.Qxd2 ... Despite the equality of material, White emerges with an advantage good enough to win:  31.Nf4 32.Qd8ch Kg7 33.Ka2 Nxh3 34.g5! ... whereupon the threat of mate forces Black to give up his knight: 34...Nxg5 35.Qxg5.} fxe2 {[??] A complete miscalculation ... or something.  Black could have won the game by 30...Qe4ch 31.Ka1 (or 31.Ka2, makes no difference) ...Rxe2, and White must lose material.  Probably best, hopeless as it was, would have been 32.Rxf3ch, but White would be in a major piece endgame a rook down.} 31. Rxe2 {[?] Good enough for the draw, but White could have won, here: 31.Rxf4 CHECK!} Rxe2 32. Qxe2 Qg3 {[=] Queen end games are notoriously tricky and hard to win.  The position here would probably be abandoned as a draw in top flight chess, as the pawn formations are entirely symmetrical: 3-3 and 2-2 on the flanks, no passed pawn, not even any 'candidates' (by which I mean a pawn that is not 'passed' but has no enemy pawn directly in front of it).  All the same, there are some lessons to be learned from the sequel, and interesting moments as well.} 33. c4 {[?!] Already a slight mistake, I think, as Black could at once have taken the h-pawn.  That probably should not have been enough to win, but... it would have given Black something to work on.} Qg1+ 34. Ka2 Qd4 {Centralising.  Usually a good idea.  It has to be admitted, that winning a pawn in these sorts of endings often comes at the cost of deflecting the Queen to a flank.  If the opponent can centralise his/her queen, that might be enough to maintain a balance.} 35. b3 {Relieving the Queen of guard duties.  I still might have preferred 35.Qe6 myself, but I'm not sure it makes all that much difference.} c5 {This is a good move, providing a safe anchorage for the Queen in the centre of the board.  In what follows there will some lengthy sequences in which not much happens, but they are easy to understand.  We'll pause when things get more exciting.} 36. Qf3+ Ke7 37. Qg3 {As the b-pawn could have been taken with check, it would have been worth doing so.  Black would have had split pawn on the Q-side to protect, which might have been enough to tie it down for White to make progress.} Qd7 {[?] The Queen was well placed on d4, or Black could have forced an immediate draw by inescapable checks on d2 and d1.} 38. Qf2 {And now Qe5ch could have forced the win of the c-pawn - though Black could have forced a draw in response.  It should be said right here that White can not afford to exchange Queens - not whilst Black's king is so much closer the K-side than White's is.  With the White King so remotely placed, the pawn end game (i.e. absent the queens) is winning for Black.  } Qe6 39. Qxc5+ Kf7 {Interesting move!  If now 39.Qd5?! Qxd5 40.cxd5 ... the extra pawn is worth no more than a draw for White.  Black has to go after the isolated passed pawn, which can not be defended, but it would give the White King time enough to get to the centre files himself.} 40. Qxa7 {The two-pawn surplus might have been enough to give White reasonable winning chances, but Black can force the draw here... or...} Qe2+ {[=]} 41. Kb1 Qd1+ 42. Ka2 {42.Kb2 is better, but game would still be drawn after 42...Qd2ch 43.Kb1 Qd1ch etc.} Qc2+ 43. Ka1 Qc3+ 44. Kb1 {44.Ka2 was far safer.  Now Black pegs back the pawn deficit... with check, and therefore gaining a tempo.} Qxb3+ 45. Ka1 {[!] This time it's good, as Black can't take the c-pawn with check.} Qd1+ 46. Ka2 {Better Kb2.} Qc2+ 47. Ka1 Qc1+ {Well played: now he'll win the c-pawn with check...} 48. Ka2 Qc2+ {Better 48...Qxc4ch then 49.Qd5.} 49. Ka1 Qxc4 {Black could still have played ...Qc1ch and then ...Qxc4 ch.  There was no danger (yet) of a threefold repetition of the position.} 50. Kb1 {This move is a puzzle:  White was not in check, and could have picked up the b-pawn WITH check.  White would then have had some chances - however slender, for the passed a-pawn has a long way to go - of going for the win.  Possession of a passed pawn often makes the decisive difference in Queen and pawn end games.} Qb3+ 51. Ka1 Qd1+ 52. Ka2 Qe2+ 53. Ka1 Qd1+ 54. Ka2 Qd2+ 55. Ka1 Qc3+ {55....Qd1ch would have permitted White to claim a draw by threefold repetition (of the position).} 56. Ka2 Qxh3 57. Qxb7+ Kg8 58. Qb8+ {I prefer Qc8ch here, keeping guard over the g-pawn.} Kg7 59. Qb7+ Kh6 60. a4 {Sacrificing her K-side to push the passed pawn.  Not a bad strategic decision, and should be good enough to hold.  It might be too much really to hope for the win, as the White King is very exposed.} Qxg4 61. Qa7 Qe6+ 62. Ka1 {[?]  The very worst place for the King to go - he's no help there.  The King should now be trying to advance up the board to give his queen and pawn a helping hand.  62.Ka3 would have been fine.  Bear in mind the King is in no danger from the lone queen, provided he stays off the g1-a7 diagonal (especially on the four centre files, though the King should probably travel no farther west than the c-file anyhow.).} Qf6+ 63. Kb1 g5 64. a5 g4 65. a6 Qf1+ 66. Kc2 Qc4+ 67. Kd1 Qf1+ 68. Kc2 Qe2+ 69. Kb1 Qd1+ 70. Ka2 Qd2+ 71. Ka1 Qc1+ 72. Ka2 Qc2+ 73. Ka1 Qa4+ 74. Kb1 Qb4+ 75. Kc1 Qe1+ 76. Kb2 Qe2+ 77. Kb1 Qd1+ {In all this, White should really have kept her king off the back rank, for three reasons: [1] freedom; [2] to obviate the possibility of promotion with check; and [3] the main reason, because when Black checks on the back rank the queen also covers the queening square.  Had the White King advanced up the board, or at least stayed off the back rank, Black would have had to try for the perpetual and a draw, or else risk a tempo to achieve promotion.  Bear in mind here that White's a-pawn can not be stopped from promoting (once White plays Qb7), now, other than by continual checking - or giving up the Black Queen.} 78. Ka2 g3 79. Qb6+ {79.Qe3ch offered more ways for Black to go wrong - always worth a consideration if all other things are equal!} Kh5 80. a7 Qe2+ {An unnecessary check that uncovers the queening square (g1).} 81. Ka3 {[!] Well played: steals a march on Black.} g2 82. a8=Q Qd3+ 83. Ka2 Qe2+ 84. Kb3 Qd1+ 85. Kc3 {Probably best.  At first sight Kc4 looks better but I don't think there is anything in it.  } Qc1+ 86. Kd3 Qd1+ 87. Kc3 {Very good.  Ke3?? would have been disastrous (87.Ke3?? g1=Qch  88.Ke4 Qxb6).} Qe1+ 88. Kd3 Qg3+ 89. Ke2 Qg4+ {[??] A terrible oversight that ought to have lost.  It is all too easy in situations like this, when you feel you have the draw in hand and you could keep on checking (or being checked) forever, to forget that there are hazards in any position.  White's King successfully avoided the perils of the a- and b-files, and the g1-h7 diagonal where sharp stakes - skewers - abounded.  But Now Black walks into a deadly half-pin...} 90. Kd2 {[??] ... and White returns the compliment.  The right move was 90.Qf3! ... forcing the exchange of one pair of queens, and leaving White with a winning endgame, Queen versus two pawns - no, one pawn (90.Qf3 Qxf3ch 91.Kxf3 and picks up the g-pawn next move).} g1=Q 91. Qxg1 {Although Black emerges a pawn ahead, the position is a safe draw after this.  But White might still have tried exploiting the awkward placing of the Black queens by playing 91.Qe8ch.  For example, after 91.Qe8ch Kg5?? 92.Qxg1 Qxg1 93.Qg8ch skewers the Black King and Queen and wins.  So: 91.Qe8ch Kh4  92.Qh6ch Kg3  93.Qe5ch ... At this point Black might escape the checks by ...Kf2 or ...Kg2, but 93...Kf3?? 94.Qe2ch Kg3  95.Qxg4ch Kxg4 96.Qg7ch and another skewer.  Again: there was little to lose by inviting Black to go wrong.} Qf4+ {[??]  This I do not understand, at any level.  Maybe he misread the diagonals (I've seen that happen, even with strong players, though that is very rare).  Of course 91...Qxg1 was the only worthwhile move.} 92. Ke2 Qc4+ 93. Kd2 Qf4+ 94. Qe3 {Good.  Cuts down Black's options.} Qh2+ {[??]} 95. Kd3 {Correct was 95.Qe2ch.} Qd6+ 96. Ke2 Qh2+ 97. Kd3 Qd6+ 98. Ke4 {Averting the threefold repetition of Ke2.  But 98.Qd4 still looks good to me. } Qe6+ 99. Kd4 Qf6+ {[??] Black has to avoid an exchange of Queens to have the slightest hope.} 100. Kd3 {100.Qe5ch would have ensured the win for White, by forcing the exchange of queens.} Qf5+ 101. Ke2 Qc2+ 102. Ke1 Qb1+ 103. Ke2 Qb2+ 104. Ke1 Qb1+ 105. Ke2 Qb2+ 106. Ke1 Qb1+ 107. Ke2 {Draw by threefold repetition.  White still had the winning of the game before the repetition, but had to make up her mind by Queen interventions to protect her King, and then go after her opponent's.  Both sides had chances in this game, Black in the middle game, White in the ending.}
