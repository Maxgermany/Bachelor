1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d6 4. e4 Bg7 {So it starts as a conventional King's Indian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Indian_Defence} 5. f3 {I play the Samisch_Variation  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation} O-O 6. Be3 {The usual moves.} Nc6 {Panno Variation: 6...Nc6  The Panno line, named after Oscar Panno, is a sharp and highly theoretical system which can lead to very complicated play. Black holds back the c-pawn for the time being, and aims to put the knight on d4. The immediate plan is to prepare queenside counterplay with ...a6, ...Rb8 followed by ...b5.} 7. Nge2 {This is the usual reply, so that if 7.....e5 8. d4 black can't play Nd4, which is a very strong sacrifice if say 7. Qd2 e5 8. d4 Nd4 white shouldn't grab the pawn with 9. Bxd4 exd4 10. Qxd4 because of 10....Nxe4!! with advantage to black.} e5 {7.... a6 may be stronger.} 8. d5 {So close the centre.} Ne7 {Knight drops back.} 9. Qd2 {Now I do the usual queen move, maybe playing Bh6 at some stage as part of a king-side attack and/or 0-0-0.} Ne8 {He prepares the thematic f7-f5 break.} 10. g4 {So basically I am saying - well if you do play f7-f5 I will at least open the g file against your king.} f5 {But he plays it anyway.} 11. gxf5 {I take.} gxf5 {He takes back. Here I had a mental aberration. I wanted to play 12. Bh3 but thought that he could win a piece with 12......f4, because if I play 13. Bxc8 I was afraid of him playing fxe3 attacking my queen. It was only after I castled I realised that I had 14. Be6+ saving my light squared bishop and going a pawn up. However later I found out that 0-0-0 is in fact the most widely played move here. } 12. O-O-O {So I castled.} f4 {And now he blocks the king-side up} 13. Bf2 {Bishop drops back.} Ng6 {With ideas of going to h4 to attack f3.} 14. Qe1 {So I stop that.} Nf6 {The other knight comes up.} 15. h4 {Threatening h4-h5 and maybe h5-h6 at some stage.} Nh5 {So he stops that.} 16. Bh3 {I offer an exchange of light squared bishops. If he doesn't take I can play Bg4.} Bxh3 {So he took.} 17. Rxh3 {I take back.} Qd7 {Queen attacks my rook.} 18. Qh1 {I protect my rook.} Kh8 {He prepares for action on the open g file.} 19. Rg1 {So do I. I am now threatening Rg5 attacking the Nh5, and if it moves, I can play h4-h5 and now the follow-up h5-h6 will win a piece.} Bh6 {This is an interesting position. I would have loved to have play 20. Rg5 anyway, as after 20.....Bxg5 21. hxg5 his Nh5 can't drop back to f6 as my pawn is in that square and it can't really drop back to g7 as then h7 falls. However I think after 21.... Ng3 although I can get a pawn for the exchange I don't think it is enough, which is why I decided against playing it. I also thought in this position, he is threatening to drop his Nh5 into g3 and if I take it, he takes back with the pawn, with a discovered attack. For that reason I decided to move my king off the same diagonal as his bishop.} 20. Kb1 {With this move.} Rfg8 {So he gets ready for the g file action.} 21. Rh2 {I have a plan - Rg-g2 followed by N-g1-h3-g5, threatening to go to e6.} a6 {My 14 year old opponent offered a draw here.} 22. Rgg2 {I played on.} Raf8 {He bought his other rook over. I now realised that 23. Ng1 doesn't work, as he has 23.... Ng3 and if 24. Nxg3 fxg3 25. Rxg3 he has 25....Bf4 winning the exchange. I now see I may be winning in those sorts of variations, after 25. Rh3 Bf4 26. Nc3-e2 - but he may have enough compensation, he may be able to open lines on the queen-side. Bearing in mind we were 1-0 up and looking good for a win on one board, I said "Do you still want that draw?" He asked me to make a move first.} 23. Rg4 {I played this. He had a long think, then offered his hand with the word "draw?". I accepted of course, although I think I may have had an edge in the final position. What do you think dear reader?
