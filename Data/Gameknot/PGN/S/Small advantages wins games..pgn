1. e4 {Black built up a series of small advantages to break through and win a pawn on move 20.  The game continued with a rook on the 2nd rank that confined white's king, allowed black to advance up the board, and mate.  Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes.} c5 {The Sicilian defence breaks symmetry by contesting the d4 square with the c pawn rather than the e pawn.  White often attacks the kingside while black obtains a queenside advantage.  Grandmaster John Nunn noted that the reason for the Sicilian Defence’s popularity “is its combative nature; in many lines Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack.”} 2. c4 {Attempting to reestablish symmetry, this often transposes into positions arising from the English opening.  2. Nf3 is most common.} Nc6 3. Nf3 e6 {Preparing for d5.} 4. g3 {?! - Dubious.  White's kingside bishop can already be developed via e2, so weakening the kingside castle is unneccessary.  Better is Nc3, contesting the center d6 square.} d5 5. Qe2 {?! - Dubious.  Developing the queen too early often leads to a loss of tempo as she is attacked and forced to move multiple times.  Better is Nc3.} dxe4 6. Qxe4 {After the exchange, white is left with a backward pawn on the half-open d file.  This will become the focus for an attack.} Nf6 {Developing with tempo.} 7. Qc2 Be7 8. Bg2 O-O 9. O-O Rb8 {Moving the rook off of the long diagonal and preparing to fianchetto the lightsquared bishop to counter white's bishop.  It may have been better to play b6, allowing Bb7 next move.} 10. Nc3 {Finally developing the 2nd white knight, but too late to influence the earlier exchange.} b6 11. Ng5 {Opening up the bishop and threatening black's knight.  Also threatens mate (Qxh7#) if black's f6 knight can be lured away.} Nd4 {Forcing the queen to retreat again.} 12. Qd1 {White's queen has moved 4 times and returned to her original square, effectively wasting 4 moves.  During that time, black has developed all but one of his pieces and constructed a solid pawn chain supporting a centralized knight.  However, advantages in development and time are temporary and need to be taken advantage of immediately or the opponent will have the opportunity to equalize.} Bb7 {Countering the strong white bishop.} 13. Bxb7 Rxb7 {Exchanging the bishops leaves the pawns around white's king weak.  The exchange also lifted black's rook, enabling black to to easily double pieces on the half-open d file.} 14. Ne2 {Attempting to trade off black's dominating centralized knight.} Rd7 15. Nxd4 Rxd4 16. b3 Rd3 {Protecting the rook from Nf3 (or Bb2, though that would give up the d pawn).  16...Ne4?! 17. Nxe4 Rxe4 18. Bb2 would isolate black's rook in the center and give white some counterplay.} 17. Qc2 {Qe2 is probably better, as it still allows Rd1, protecting the d pawn, and protects Ng3} Ng4 {Attacking the g5 knight and preparing Bg6.} 18. Nh3 {Ne4 may have been better as this regulates the knight to the edge of the board for most of the rest of the game.  Perhaps white was expecting to follow it up with Ng4, forcing the rook to retreat.} Bf6 {Taking the long diagonal and threatening white's rook.  This prevents the possibility of a3 and Ra2.} 19. Rb1 Qd6 {Preparing for Rd8, which would triple pieces on the d file, further pressuring the d pawn.} 20. Bb2 {Giving up the d pawn.} Rxd2 {Not 20...Bxb2? 21. Rxb2 Rd8 22. Rd1, which would protect the d pawn (after Nf6-e4, white could add more pressure to the d pawn, however white could play 23. Nf4 forcing Rd4 and play for a draw with 24. Ne2).} 21. Qc1 Bxb2 {Eliminating the potentially dangerous bishop.} 22. Rxb2 Rd8 23. Rxd2 Qxd2 24. Qxd2 Rxd2 {The exchange leaves black with a rook on the 2nd rank, where it will dominate the rest of the game.  The power of a rook on the 2nd rank is two fold: it confines the king to the back rank and forces the opponent to defend pawns with pieces.} 25. Ra1 {Attempting to defend the a pawn.  Unfortunately, white has few alternatives.  Ng5 (or Ng4) followed by h3 would have driven the black knight off, but would have surrendered the queenside pawns in the process.    Ng5 followed by Nf3 would have forced black to either give up the d file or the 2nd rank.  If black could have seized the d file, it may have been worth the a and b pawns.} h6 {Preventing Ng5.} 26. Kg2 {Better is Nf4, centralizing the knight.  This pins the f pawn, though to be fair, white is in danger of losing either the f or a pawn no matter what he does.} g5 {Preventing Nf4.  If 27. Kf3 then f5 traps the king and forces a further loss of time.} 27. Kf1 {Abandons the h pawn, hoping to attack the rook.  } Nxh2+ 28. Ke1 Nf3+ 29. Kf1 e5 30. Ng1 Nd4 31. Re1 {Offering to trade the a pawn for black's e pawn.} f6 {Trading pawns would allow white some counterplay along the open e file, so black refuses.} 32. Ne2 Rxa2 {Since the d file is now closed, black feels safe enough to pick up the unprotected a pawn.} 33. Nxd4 cxd4 {The exchange gives black a passed pawn.} 34. Rb1 Kf7 {Finally mobilizing the king.  As more pieces leave the board, the king becomes more and more powerful.  He'll need to escort the pawns forward and eventually help give mate.} 35. b4 Rc2 {Trading queenside pawns to prevent surprises from that side of the board.} 36. c5 bxc5 37. bxc5 Rxc5 38. Rb7+ Kg6 {Because black had already moved off of the back rank, he wasn't trapped like white's king.} 39. Rxa7 Rc2 {Reestablishing 2nd rank dominance.} 40. Kg2 g4 {Prevents white from escaping.} 41. Ra8 {White is already lost as this point, as black will slowly advance his pawns while continuing to confine the white king.  However, Ra1, Ra3, or Ra4 will provide more resistance than random checks.} d3 42. Rg8+ Kf5 {The check just pushes black's king where he wants it.  Better would be Rd8 forcing black to be careful of the pawn.} 43. Kf1 {Hoping to prevent queening or escape the back rank.} Ke4 {With white on the back rank, black set a trap.} 44. Rxg4+ {? - Bad, facing either mate or loss of the rook.  This was the only major blunder of the game.} Kf3 45. Rg6 {White overlooked the mate.  However, even 45. Kg1 doesn't save white after d2 46. Kh2 (Rg6 d1=Q  47. Kh2 Rxf2  48. Kh3 Qh1#) d1=Q 47. Kh3 48. Qh1#.  .  } Rc1# {0-1  Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes.}
