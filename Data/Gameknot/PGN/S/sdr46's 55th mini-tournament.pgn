1. Nf3 {A remarkable high-draw game where, with an exchange down, white manages to almost win the game. } d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. a3 {No one would recommend this move at this point. b4 IS in fact an important square you have to care of, eventually, but not in this early stage of the game, and not before black goes e6. } c6 {Now, white has to take care of Qb6, threatening b2. I normally play c3 (would c4 be preferable?), but if c3 now, a3 becomes useless. } 4. e3 {Self-bloking the dsb, but normal, since Bc1 is dued to guard b2. } Bf5 5. c4 {That's better than c3. a3 has a purpose, even if black is using his developement tempoes without challenging b4, making a3 a waste of time. It is a very delicate equilibrium in openings like this... and very fascinating. } e6 6. Nc3 {Ok, now a3 has a purpose (to prevent the dsb's developement with pin), and the white position resembles a little more one of a "normal" game. Nevertheless, it seems that black is a little more armonious and coordinated. } Bd6 7. Be2 {I would have played Ne5, but this is only my style. This move seems a little passive, though. } Nbd7 8. O-O {A normal developement plan, but without any attack in it. } O-O {I try to castle queenside, as white, to launch a kingside pawn storm. Black helps by putting his king just on the side white can attack best. } 9. b4 {...but white has other plans - normal, having castled kingside. } a5 {A strategic battle for b4 and b5. It is very interesting. Of course white can try c5, but it leads to a lot of tactic lines (axb4, cxB, bxN...). Otherwise, if black retires the bishop, b5 favours white. } 10. b5 {I like this move. b5 is better for white than b4. } dxc4 {I would thank black for this. } 11. Bxc4 c5 12. d5 {!? Correct: white tries to open the white diagonal. But what would she do after e5 by black, followed by e4? } exd5 {As black I would have preferred e5. } 13. Nxd5 {White's game is coming to life, even if the dsb is still on it starting square. } Ne5 {Black fights back for dark diagonals control. White can't develop his dsb in b2 because of NxB, so probably you can try Qe2, accepting to lose the bishop's pair, but somewhat catch up in developement. } 14. Nxe5 {This alternative saves the bishop's pair, but at the moment, black's are much more dangeroud than white's. } Bxe5 15. Ra2 {The plan was Rd2 from the start of the NxN sequence. It looks promising. White's bishop blocks black's c pawn, and white keeps some perspective of attack with Qb3, b6, Nc7...} Bb1 {Dramatic. It seemed that black oversighted Rd2, but in fact this was exactly what he wanted.} 16. Rd2 {The rook will land here anyway. } Ne4 {...because this way, the rook has no squares. Interesting here is Bb2. } 17. Qe2 {Accepting to lose the exchange. } Nxd2 18. Bxd2 {With this move played, b6 was interesting for white, so to make black worry about the a pawn. } Be4 {Dramatic, but somewhat slow? Here, it seems that everything is prepared for a black sac, or some Qh4 like move...} 19. Nc3 Bg6 {Neither wants to lose the bishop pair... obviously. If black doesn't manage to break in, the game will be decided in the endgame. White can't build an attack right now. Has few strong points, and it is very hard to exploit them the right way. White succeeded, let's see how. } 20. Rd1 {Qh4 now is not a real threat anymore, since the black's lsb is away from the white big diag. Black have to use the rooks to build something against the white king. } Qf6 21. Nd5 Qh4 {Well, for this, black could well have played it before. } 22. g3 {It was tempting Nf4, and try black to lose the bishops' pair. But white is wise and tries to "freeze" the game. I think that black missed a chance, here. Qh3 would almost force white to exchange queens with Qf1. White can't move the f pawn to block white's bishop on e4 without taking care of Bxg3 (it must have been a sac somewhere... :-). } Qd8 {If black wanted to weaken white's castling, he should have looked what else to do. The Qf6 manouver has some sense if we think that by moving the knight, white concedes again e4 to the black's lsb. This would be deadly if combined with Qh3, but white already knows she can defend from it (at the cost of queen's exchange). } 23. Be1 {I like this move...} Re8 24. Qf3 Qg5 {It doesn't seem black finds the right plan. Part of it was b6, blocking white and defending a5. And Kh8, so to be able to use the pawns for attack. } 25. h4 {A calculated risk. Very daring. } Qh5 26. Qxh5 {So we abandon the middle game. } Bxh5 27. Rb1 {It's hard to see an improvement for white's position with the queen's exchange. And this move just leaves b6 to black. } Bf3 {This is mainly to prevent white's f4. Very nasty. } 28. Nb6 {...but now, the white knight comes to life. } Ra7 29. a4 {There was nothing better? } Bc7 30. Nd5 {threatening b6. } Bxd5 {Black has no way to get rid of the threat but exchanging his bishopp... a strategic victory for white. } 31. Bxd5 b6 {At last! :-)} 32. e4 {Can black break white's defences? It seemed not!} Be5 33. f4 Bd4+ 34. Kg2 {This just helps white to consolidate. Maybe better was to open the game with Kf8, f5...} Rae7 {Is black preparing for sac the exchange for the pawn?} 35. Kf3 Rd8 36. Bd2 Kf8 {At last, but white still has...} 37. g4 {! Black should have chosen another way: pushing the c pawn. But it was not easy...} g6 38. f5 f6 {In order to open the way to the rook to the g or h column. } 39. Bh6+ Ke8 40. Bf4 gxf5 41. gxf5 Rg7 {Good for white. The g column was much more under control than the h one. Black can't penetrate right now, unless he wants to exchange more material. The static pawn's formation helps white in keeping the balance, even against the exchange. The bishop's pair proves to be very strong. Black has to sac the exchange (RxB and at least one pawn) in order to progress... being the c pawn the answer to black's game. } 42. Bc6+ {! Very nice, but not for the check itself, but for the plan to use the bishop's pair that is behing. } Ke7 43. Bc7 Rdg8 {Very good! White can't take the pawn because of g3, but it is useless against...} 44. Bd5 {White gets his goals one by one. } Rc8 {Black doesn't have time to play Be5. } 45. Bxb6 Kd6 {? Be5 keeps black's pressure against the open column g. } 46. Bxa5 {Now white has a free pawn... } Ra7 {It was interesting Bc7+. Either piece takes, white takes a rook and if black places one of them on b, so to take the white rook in b1... white will have tempo to queen tha pawn. Is there a flaw in it?} 47. Bd2 Rxa4 48. b6 Rb8 49. b7 {White bishop's power... } Kc7 50. Bf4+ Be5 {Now, this exchange allows another free pawn for white. } 51. Bxe5+ fxe5 52. f6 h5 {! it blocks the king's penetration... it's incredible: with two rooks, black is not able to harass the white king. Really? Ra3+, Kg4, Rg8+, Kf5, Rf2+, Ke6...} 53. Rb3 {Stopping the check. } Ra1 54. f7 {Mainly for preventing black from taking g1, and leaving Rc1 wihtout effect. } Rf1+ 55. Kg2 Rf4 56. Rg3 {Ok, now look: shouldn't white win here? For sure she takes back the exchange, but what if now white played Rf3 instead? Rg4+, Kf2 and... any black move, white will win a rook or more. } Rxh4 57. Rg8 {The problem with this move is that allows...} Rf4 58. Rg5 c4 {All this deserves more deep look than mine...} 59. Rxe5 c3 60. Re7+ Kb6 61. Re6+ Kb5 {Draw was agreed here. It probably was, but... a pity they didn't play some more moves! A fascinating game, with a lot of hidden threats and tricks. I hope you enjoyed it. }
