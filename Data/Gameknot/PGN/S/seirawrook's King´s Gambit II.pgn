1. e4 {Thematic tournament, } e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4 Qh4+ {!? A speculative move, not considered the strongest reply, leading to the type of tactics that appeal to KG players.} 4. Kf1 Bc5 {?! Increases Whites lead in development.} 5. d4 Bb6 6. Nf3 {White has good development in compensation for the pawn and loss of right to castle.} Qf6 7. e5 Qc6 {Moving the Q again.} 8. Qe2 Qh6 {?! Another Q move. White seems to have full compensation for the pawn which remains weak.} 9. Nc3 Ne7 10. Qe4 g5 {?! Determined to try and hold the pawn, but White is developing a strong attack.} 11. h4 Rg8 12. Rh2 {Not just threatening the g pawn but preparing the R for action.} Qg6 {Black decides, belatedly, to give back the pawn but White retains a ferocious initiative even so.} 13. hxg5 Nf5 14. Bxf4 Nc6 15. Nd5 {White has Black in a strong bind.} Kf8 {To prevent the fork.} 16. c3 Nce7 17. Nf6 {The White N settles on f6, and at this point is worth as much as Black's trapped rook.} Rh8 18. Bd3 d6 19. Kf2 Ng8 {Black wants to exchange Ns, but...} 20. Rah1 {Here exd was to be considered, but White wanted to be cautious and strengthen the bind.} Nfe7 21. exd6 cxd6 22. Bxd6 Qxe4 23. Bxe4 a5 24. Rh2xh7 {Obvious, but crushing. } Rxh7 25. Rxh7 Ba7 26. Ne5 Nxf6 {Black is desperate to try and shake the bind, but it is too late.} 27. gxf6 Kg8 28. Rg7+ {Here Black resigns. If...Kh8, it is mate. If... Kf8, then Bxf8+ Ke8 Rg8#.}
