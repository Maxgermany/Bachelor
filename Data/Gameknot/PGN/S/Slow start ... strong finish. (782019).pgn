1. e4 c5 {Sicilian Defense.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Ne5 {We have just left the book.} 5. f4 {This leaves him only 2 choices, put the knight back where it came from or put it on g6 where it cannot advance for some time to come.} Ng6 {Putting it back on c6 where it came from was better, but also an admission that Ne5 was a  mistake.} 6. Nc3 e6 7. f5 {Here I was inspired by an idea that originated with Bobby Fischer.  He observed that in this opening if black's king's knight is developed to f6 there is a shortage of good squares to move it to after that, so harassing it with a pawn can be quite effective.  It looked to me like the same was true for his knight on g6.  So in spite of his pawn on e6 I attack with my f-pawn.} exf5 8. exf5 Ne5 9. Bf4 Nc6 {That's the 5th time he's moved that knight ...} 10. Nxc6 {... So I thought after he had invested so many moves in that one piece it would be a terrible blow to his psyche if I took it.  Maybe, but a much better move was Ndb5 threatening to fork his king and rook on c7.  Probably I did him a favor by preventing that knight from wasting any more of his time.} bxc6 11. Bd6 {Probably worse than my last move.  It's all bluff.  If he takes the bishop I recapture with my queen menacing his king.  But it's an empty threat because he can put his queen on e7 forcing a trade of queens and he is fine.  Perhaps he does not like the idea of taking the queens off the board this early in the game.} Be7 {I was selling wolf tickets and he was buying.  The bluff worked.  (B.T.W.  bluffing is a good idea in poker, not so much in chess.  But sometimes you get lucky.)} 12. Qe2 {For most of the rest of the game his pinned bishop is the focus of the action.} a5 {This is a mistake.  In his defense it is hard for him to develop any of his pieces here.  So he is preparing to bring out either his queen's bishop or rook.  His other pieces need to stay where they are to defend his pinned bishop.  He should have moved his king to break the pin on his bishop.  Of course the bishop would still be pinned by my bishop, but he could exchange bishops and get rid of the pin permanently.  This requires foregoing castling which he is apparently unwilling to do.} 13. O-O-O {Taking care of king safety and adding support to my dark square bishop all with one move.} a4 {Two wasted pawn moves...} 14. a3 {...so I reciprocate with an unnecessary pawn move of my own.  It's hard to ignore a pawn advancing on your king's fortress, but there is a move that makes that moot ... 14. Qe5 threatening Bc7 trapping his queen as well as Qxg2 picking up the rook in the corner.  I had considered it but rejected it because of 14... f6.  Somehow 15. Qg3 totally eluded me (I think I was loath to move my queen off the e-file thus releasing his bishop from the pin).  Also, at the time I didn't see the threat of trapping his queen, I was just focused on the attack on the g-pawn and the rook.} Ba6 15. Qe3 {Again 15. Qe5 was the correct move.} Bxf1 {His last move was not the greatest, but this is worse!  He moved his bishop twice to take my bishop which never moved only to assist me in bringing my rook out of the corner.} 16. Rhxf1 Nf6 {He really wants to castle.} 17. Rde1 {Not so fast!  Now his bishop on e7 is vulnerable.  He has just removed one vital defender of the bishop and if he castles he removes another.} Ng8 {Restoring equilibrium on e7, but it's too late.} 18. Qg5 {Resistance is futile...} Nf6 {...and so overrated.  Maybe he didn't notice my attack on his g-pawn.  I think he still had hopes of castling.  He should have castled 2 moves ago and just accepted the loss of his bishop and the exchange that follows (net loss 1 rook).  Now he loses much more.  More logical would be 18... Kf8 defending the g-pawn, but 19. Rxe7 Nxe7 20. f6 gxf6 Qxf6 and now my queen threatens mate on f7 and h8!} 19. Qxg7 Rg8 20. Qxf6 Kf8 {Finally he moves the king to break the pin on his bishop...almost.} 21. Bxe7+ {A family fork.  Probably 21. Rxe7 is better because it is threatening Qxf7# so about the only reply is 21... Qxe7 22. Qxe7+ Kg7 23. Be5+ Kh6 24. Qh4#.  If after 21. Rxe7 Rg7 to stop Qxf7#, then 22. Rxf7+ (double check) then if 22... Ke8  23. Rf8# and if 22... Kg8 23. Qxg7#.  Still, everything works out just fine.  A queen and a knight are an insurmountable advantage.} Qxe7 22. Rxe7 Rg7 {Here I saw a 4 move checkmate but there was a 3 move checkmate which I didn't see (23. Rfe1 h5 24. Rxf7+ Rxf7 25. Qh8# or 23. Rfe1 Kg8 24. Re8+ Rxe8 25. Rxe8#).  I think my 4 move combination is prettier and much easier to find as all the moves are either forced or a choice between checkmate now vs. later.} 23. Rxf7+ {Check!  Do you want to be checkmated now (e.g. 23... Kg8 24. Qxg7# or 23... Ke8 24. Qe7#) or later? } Rxf7 {He choses later.} 24. Qh8+ Ke7 {Forced.} 25. Re1+ Kd6 {Again forced.} 26. Qe5# {And checkmate!}
