[Opening "Sicilian, Chekhover variation (B53)"]

1. e4 {Best by test.} c5 {The amateur chooses to play a non-Classical line. The problem with this is that any master will know the variations of whatever opening you use as an amateur, and if you try an opening you're not familiar with, you can lose the game very quickly.} 2. Nf3 {All masters develop quickly in simuls. If the amateur delays their development, the master can smash them in a hurry.} d6 {Guarding the BP.} 3. d4 {De Bolster plays to open the game quickly, thinking that in a tactical knife fight he has the superior weaponry.} cxd4 {The amateur captures the Pawn, opening the position up.} 4. c3 {Instead of the routine recapture, De Bolster gambits a Pawn to open yet more lines.} dxc3 {The amateur accepts the offer.} 5. Nxc3 {In return for his Pawn, De Bolster has an advantage in development, an open QB file and a half-open Q file.} Nf6 {Finally developing a piece.} 6. Bc4 {Pressuring KB7, a notorious weak point.} Nc6 {Trying to make up ground in development.} 7. e5 {De Bolster offers yet another Pawn to blast open what's left of Black's defenses.} Nxe5 {Black gobbles this Pawn as well.} 8. Nxe5 {White initiates the exchange of Knights...} dxe5 {...and when Black finishes it, the Queen file is fully opened.} 9. Bxf7+ {White exploits this immediately.} Kxf7 {Black's only legal move.} 10. Qxd8 {Wins the Queen. Black resigns.}
