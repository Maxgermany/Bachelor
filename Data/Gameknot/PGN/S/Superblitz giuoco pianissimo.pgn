[Opening "Two knights defence (Modern bishop's opening) (C55)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Aiming for an italian opening. I am not familiar with playing this with black, I must say, but I guess is all about flipping sides. But since I am better aware with the three knight defence, I will try that.} Nf6 4. d3 {So white refuses to go for the classic 4.Ng5, d5; 5.exd, Na5 line. Instead, it goes for a slow variant, if I may say so (haven't played this since I was ten...many moons ago), but safe and solid. It gives time for black to develop quietly, if properly done.} Bc5 5. c3 {So eventually goes for the "pianissimo" mode, very slow, very safe. Now, it is important for the amateur here to keep an eye on this set up on the board, since it reproduces a very common position/situation in this opening (as well as with some Spanish variants). e5 is held by Nc6, but white now threats to hit the Bc5 and then the Nc6, therefore potentially gaining on e5. And thus, it is again making the point on how important is not only know the moves, but the basis, why it may or may not be advantageous going in that direction (gaining a pawn), and most importantly, how to reply adequately to those (weak or not) attacks. In this case, I find myself int rouble because I couldn't reply with energy, so you will see blacks position is not that good as it should have been (as I think it should after the incoming exchange). Judge by yourselves.} O-O {  Developing and finding safety is a golden rule I try to follow, thinking I may get something back after Nxe5.} 6. b4 Bb6 7. b5 Na5 8. Nxe5 d6 {So I foresaw until here, where I thought I could even things after removing Bc4 (once WN is is moved back). Notice that otherwise, N@a5 plays little there and sees no action at all.} 9. Nxf7 {But instead , white goes for the exchange in f7, which, again, I didn't think of. White has (will) two pawns and the rook for the minor pieces, which may be a good trade (not sure though)} Rxf7 {A must} 10. Bxf7+ Kxf7 11. O-O {So now , as you can see, the pawn force on the queen side keeps BN on a5 at bay while the center and the king's can be supported by heavy artillery (after a few developing moves) and run to break BK's defences (which stand weak). Therefore, a run for development and defence has started. I must say I did not see any clear line here to play, everything looked quite jammed, but I guess binging my rook into my king's aid should be done promptly, or at least to the center.} Kg8 {Eventually I have to go back to safety and also frees the "f" file.} 12. a4 {I guess with the idea to help on b5 in case of Bc7, but otherwise seems a little bit slow to me. White needs in my opinion stronger moves to strengthen the momentum.} Be6 {After I did this, I started not to like black's position very much (even less than before) because that center of pawns was really frightening me: I was seeing them advancing in force and clogging my queen's flank and at the same time making room for the rooks to come at me. but again, you have to keep calm and think white also needs to develop. Since the g1-a7 diagonal is mine, it is worth thinking on attacking f2 an put some pressure off the center and flank. And there I went.} 13. Nd2 {A natural and good movement. It also keeps black from releasing N to b3 and then trading it for the BWS on c1, leaving black with the pair of bishops advantage.} Qe7 {With the idea of ...Rf8. Again, not sure if ...Qd7 would have been better, since the "e" file is taken by white} 14. Ba3 {An unpleasant and unexpected move. White now is not only developing but also keeping the aforementioned momentum, is pinning d6 and therefore bringing some pain to my defence. Black needs to be very careful now (not that I was though). Bb6 needs to be released some how, maybe with either a6 or c6. I opted for a6 since it does not wakens the support on d6.} a6 15. e5 {And there goes white. Very good, very aggressive movement. Threatens to weak d6 after the exchange.} Ne8 {So I brought my N to e8, but then I have blocked the access to f8 by my rook. One more time, black is still on the defensive and with no good prospects.} 16. exd6 {So I thought my rival would hold the trade for awhile, since I cannot do much so far. This may be easing my position a little bit, or so I thought.} Nxd6 17. c4 {But then it comes the pawn advance I was afraid of. Not many good moves at hand, and very little time to think of. The threat on c5 and the pinned Nd6 are really a pain.} Qf6 {So I panicked even when I saw that 18.c5 gains a piece. 17...Bd4 was a must.} 18. Bxd6 {Lucky me, white made also his biggest mistake here. } cxd6 19. Ne4 {Centering that N, where it is stronger and also attacks both queen and d6, and at the same time, defends f2.} Qd4 {I believe this is best. puts some pressure on f2, while defending d6 and also avoids being a target of white's rooks.} 20. Rb1 {Now white starts to tight my positing taking advantage of the rook on open files. Again, a good move.} Rf8 {Trying to divert some action to the other side (where I basically my only chances of complicating the game lie)} 21. bxa6 bxa6 {Notice now that BQ is some how oversaturated defending pieces. White will go for her wisely.} 22. Kh1 {But first, removes the pinned pawn problem.} Nc6 {15 moves later, BN starts to make a living. Again, the idea is to pressure white's castling.} 23. Ng5 {Now a few jumps to bring some more troubles to my queen.} Bf5 24. Nf3 Qc5 {Only one to save B on b6. Lucky me, d4 is still well defended by my army.} 25. Qb3 {More preassure. notice that White, if allowed, will have a check if c4 can advance on c5. So ...} Bd8 {... coming back to d8 doesn't seem like a bad idea.} 26. Rbd1 {d3 is not pinned anymore and can freely advance on d4} Bg4 {But now I can try to double those pawns on the "f" file. Not a real gain, but something is something.} 27. d4 {I was expecting this. Advance, advance, is what white's position is screaming up (to me at least)} Qh5 {let's go for those double pawns on f...but, what if... well, we'll see} 28. c5+ Kh8 {Now BK is "trapped" on that corner. Careful with the 8 rank there, a classic mate might be awaiting there.} 29. cxd6 {This was also, I think a slight mistake that, I didn't even myself realised while playing. Not sure if 29.Qb7 or 29. Rd3 would have been more active but thinking on the situation is coming next... Now, I have been talking about doubling those pawns on the "f" file, considering trading Bxf6 and so on, but, what about 29...} Rxf3 {! I was surprised to find this, even when the feeling of leaving the 8th rank is not really pleasant. But for a moment it was clear to me I had gained that N. Can it be a solid gain? We'll see.} 30. Qb7 {Is the only one I saw while analyzing the board after 29...Rxf3. But it seems 30...Qd5 saves the day for black. However, there is even a better move:} Rh3 {I can't help but loving this. I like it even better that 29...Rxf3, since it is even less expected. There is a mate threat on h1 and if gxh3, then Bf3+ and mate. Quite a complete move! Interesting that white cannot go for the mate on 8th and that it i blocked by a simple B on d8.} 31. f3 {Last gamble on white, and a very good one too. it creates a way out for the king while also hitting a second piece.} Rxh2+ 32. Kg1 Qh4 {But there is no option now for white. Is going to be mate in a  few moved. A very very interesting game, with interesting ideas and a happy ending (to me) that makes it a very beautiful game! But , remember also that is was a blitz game, making it difficult to find good moves, and very easy to find real bad ones. Hope you have enjoyed it as I did!}
