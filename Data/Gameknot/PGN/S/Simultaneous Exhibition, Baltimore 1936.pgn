1. e4 {Most masters open with this move in simuls. It usually leads to a quicker win.} e6 {Electing to play a French defense, hoping to draw out his resistance.} 2. d4 {The standard reply...} d5 {...and the book response.} 3. Nc3 {Strong.} Bb4 {Unafraid.} 4. Nge2 {The Alekhine Gambit.} dxe4 {Accepting the challenge.} 5. a3 {Putting the question...} Bxc3+ {...and getting an immediate answer.} 6. Nxc3 {The logical response, to avoid doubled Pawns and win back Black's advanced pawn.} Nc6 {Black counters with a threat to Dake's QP.} 7. Qg4 {Threatening QxNP winning the KR.} Nxd4 {Black has a brilliant counter in mind, which Dake overlooks.} 8. Qxg7 {Following through with his plan. However, QxP(K4) was a *much* better alternative. } Nxc2+ {With mate to follow at once.} 9. Ke2 {Forced.} Qd3# {Bravo! Score one for the amateur!}
