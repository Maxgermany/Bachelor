[White "Ding "]
[Black "Carlsen "]
[Opening "Catalan (E03), open, Alekhine variation"]

1. d4 {As with Carlsen, Ding starts off with the same opening.} Nf6 {Although I would've answered with 1...d5, I'm not surprised to see Carlsen play this.  It's standard and will become something interesting.  For example, we could talking about Grunfeld Defense, or a transposition in the QGD Semi Slav Defense like we saw in the last game.} 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5 {Like, here.  But, without ...c6 played, I believe that this is the Grunfeld Defense since I've seen similar variations with chareshiggie.} 4. Bg2 {This is what I also would've played as white.  Afterall, my thinking would be why not finish the fianchetto.  And, I think that this is a transposition into the Catalina Variation which ION in the last game.  With that being said, Ding is prepared for when Carlsen takes on c4.} dxc4 5. Qa4+ Nbd7 {Carlsen had a ready answer, but I would've played 5...Bd7 in an attempt to gain tempo.  But, Ding would've responded in the same way with his next move.} 6. Qxc4 a6 {Preparing to attack Ding's Q, at some point.} 7. Be3 {Continuing with his development.} Bd6 {As does Carlsen.} 8. Nh3 {Developing and preparing to castle, but I don't like this move since the N is on the rim.  I only say don't like because I don't think it's very good, but I'd never call a move by a GM a mistake or inaccuracy.  Having said that, I would've played 8.Nf3 for the same reason that Ding chose 8.Nh3 as his candidate move. } O-O {Meanwhile, Carlsen decides to castle, but Ding is about to do the same thing.} 9. O-O h6 {Preventing 9...Bg5, and I see the point here.  But, I would've responded with 9...Nb6 to harrass the Q.  As pinning wouldn't have forced Carlsen to ruin his K side pawn structures due to his Nd7.  So, that's where I figured out that he was going to prevent the exchange, anyhow since his Nf6 is more active then Ding's Be3.} 10. Nc3 {Completing his development once and for all.} b5 {This is where Carlsen goes on the offense.} 11. Qb3 Rb8 {Preparing to attack Ding's Nc3 a third time since it is defended twice.} 12. Nf4 {Relocating his a better place.} Bb7 {Seeing that his B is less active then Ding's, Carl tries to exchange it.  I would've refused with 13.Bh3, but Ding goes ahead with it.  So, that makes me believe that the exchange was, indirectly, forced.  I can see where that would happen, since after 13.Bh3, Carlsen can inconvience white with something like 13...g5 and after something like 14.Ng2 black could respond with 14...g4 and cause problems for white.} 13. Bxb7 Rxb7 14. Nd3 {Preventing further exchanges since his N is also more active then black's Bd6.} Qe7 {Preparing to connect his R's.} 15. Rac1 {I don't know what this move accomplishes.  Instead, I would've played 15.Rad1 to leave a R centralized.} Rbb8 {Similar story here, but I would've played 15...Rfb8 to connect the R's vertically which is known to be quite dangerous for the other side as Jack showed me.} 16. Rfd1 {I would've played 16.Rcd1 to allow 17.Rfe1, where both R's are centralized.} Rfc8 {In comparison, I would've played 16...Rb6 to allow 17...Rfb8 where both R's are on one file.  But, they, of course, know what moves work better or not then any of us since they're professionals, or as I call them the best of the best, or derived from WTW discussions, annotations, in the WTWLTR I call players like Ding and Carlsen the runner of the runners.} 17. a3 {Defending his Nc3 a third time to match up with Carlsen's attack.} c5 {Makes his Bd6 more active, but that at the same time, it allows a series of exchanges.  And, I wouldn't even be happy to exchange a pawn.  Instead, I would've tried to expose white's K with 17...Ng4.} 18. dxc5 Nxc5 19. Bxc5 Bxc5 20. Nxc5 Rxc5 21. Na2 {I don't see the point behind this move.  Instead, I would've tried to material by skewering black's Rc5 with 21.Qb4.} a5 {And, with that, I like how Carlsen responds as this prevents Ding from doing that.} 22. Qe3 {Unlike Ding's previous move, this is also what I would've done since it attacks Rc5 a second time.  Carlsen is ready and exchanges it, which I also would've done.} Rxc1 23. Nxc1 b4 {Going for another pawn exchange which Ding readily accepts since that'll give him a tempo by attacking the Q.} 24. axb4 Qxb4 25. Nd3 Qd6 {A pin which is about to be broken, at once.} 26. Rc1 {I'm not sure why Ding played this, but I think he wants to win the a5 pawn.} Nd5 {But, Carlsen will have none of that.} 27. Qd4 Qb6 {Not just attacking but also wanting Carlsen to exchange Q's which he refuses since black still needs his Q, on the board.} 28. Rc5 Qb3 29. Kg2 {Now that we're approaching the endgame the K becomes useful here which Ding is showing here.} Qb7 {I don't see the point behind this move since the Q wasn't attacked.} 30. f3 {Giving his K more places to go, but I would've attacked right away with 30.e4.} Qa6 {I don't see the point behind this move since Carlsen's Q isn't out of play.  Instead, I would've responded to Ding's last move with 30...Kh7.} 31. Kf2 {This is how I figured out the point behind 31.Kf2, although I wonder what Ding has planned for his K here.} a4 {But, Carlsen attempts to attack the pawn a third time.  And, if successful, he would win this game since Ding's pawn is only defended twice, and he has nothing to defend with, again.} 32. Qc4 {Knowing that Ding's immediately responds by attacking Carlsen's Q, and when black defends....} Qa7 33. Qd4 {Ding plans to sneak up on Carlsen's K, similar to how bhidragon overpowered my monarch.} Qa6 {Without much else better, Carlsen keeps a4 supported.} 34. Qc4 {Which is where Ding goes for a draw, given that he can't win this game, and if blunders b2 in anyway, he'll lose since Carlsen will have an unstoppable passed pawn.} Qa7 35. Qd4 {And, this is where a draw was agreed upon.  From this, I know why which is that if Carlsen refused the offer, I'm sure he would've played 35...Qa6, and after 36.Qc4 Ding would've declared a draw by repetition.}
