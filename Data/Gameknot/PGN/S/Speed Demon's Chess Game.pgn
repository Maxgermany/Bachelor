[Opening "Bishop's opening (C24), Berlin defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 Nf6 3. Nf3 {Developing, but leaving my pawn hanging.} d5 {Forks pawn and bishop.  Now my pawn is attacked by two pieces.} 4. Bb3 Nc6 5. Nc3 {And we have a huge standoff in the center.} d4 {That is definitely going to tear my center apart.} 6. Nb5 {Sets up the fork, but leaves the e4 pawn hanging.  Black has a stronger hold in the center.} Nxe4 7. O-O a6 {Chasing the knight away.  Obviously, however, one square for the knight looks a lot better than the others.  That's "looks," not "is" because they all suck.} 8. Nxc7+ {A very quick move on my part, made without really thinking about it.  I was using more time than him; that could have got me into trouble quickly.} Qxc7 {The excessively obvious move.} 9. d3 {Trying to get some of the center back.} Nc5 10. c4 {Should have moved the bishop.  But I panicked due to time control, even though I had a fair amount of time left.} Nxb3 {Wins the knight for bishop exchange.} 11. axb3 Bd6 12. Bg5 {And I grab some squares in his territory; maybe I can force him to panic.} O-O 13. Be3 {A very quick move made without thinking at all, and a huge mistake.  Should definitely have thought a little more, like how to get the a1 rook into the action.} dxe3 {No messing around here.} 14. fxe3 e4 {This was a mistake.  I could now play dxe4 and open up (most of) the d-file for my queen.} 15. Ng5 {A slight mental lapse.} Bxh2+ 16. Kh1 {Forced, and my king is crammed in a box, but black cannot work with that without freeing the king.} exd3 {Ouch!} 17. Qxd3 {My queen stares bullets at the h-pawn.} Rd8 {Threatens the queen.  That rook looks like a good piece to take...} 18. Qxh7+ {but I want the pawn.} Kf8 {Forced} 19. Qh8+ Ke7 {Forced again} 20. Qxg7 Bd6 {Probably could have found better moves with another second or two of searching.  He was probably counting on me getting into time trouble.} 21. Qxf7# {That never happens, I checkmate him with 17.5 seconds to spare.  Black ended with 36 seconds left on his clock.}
