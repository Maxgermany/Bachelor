1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 {So far, so usual; getting ready to bring out my other minor pieces into the acres of space Black has allowed me...} a6 {I couldn't figure out the point of this, expecting the more usual 4...c6, which allows the Queen back off the limb she's perched on. But Black wants to play the Knight to c6 and, presumably, doesn't fancy the pin that would result from Bb5. Seems dubious to me.} 5. Bd2 {So I get ready to reveal an attack on the Queen.} Nc6 {There goes the Knight to c6...} 6. d5 {And I just can't help but chase it. Possibly to the square its aiming at anyway.} Nb4 {Now my d-pawn's twice attacked} 7. Bc4 {So I defend it twice. However, giving it up with 7.a3 Nxd5 was perfectly fine, according to the analysis, because of 8.Bb5+ Qxb5 9.Nxb5 axb5. My question to all those who must knw: why 8...Qxb5?? Why can't Black just capture the Bishop with the pawn? I can't see how the Queen gets trapped if that's the danger. But anyway, I took what seemed the obvious line and defended the d-pawn, developing a pice.} Bf5 {Now I see Black's plan; he's building up to a nasty fork on c2. But it surely isn't a real threat?} 8. Bb3 {Suitably defended.} Nf6 {I'm starting to think advancing that d-pawn was asking for trouble...} 9. a3 {Belatedly (according to the computer) I drive away the Knight... and it really doesn't have any place to go.} Bxc2 {So Black effectively hands me a pawn...} 10. Bxc2 Nbxd5 11. Nf3 {I get my final piece out and am happy. And so I should be; this is a fine position for White.} O-O-O {A sensible Q-side castling brings the Black Rook into a line with my Queen...} 12. Rc1 {So I do much the same against the Black King.} Nxc3 {Black has rather murdered my Q-side, and I need to get my King to safety.} 13. bxc3 {But first I must recapture, splitting up my pawns in the process. But there was no option.} e5 {Instead of taking the a-pawn, Black reveals another attack on it.} 14. Ng5 {And, quite forgetting my intention of getting my King to safety, I embark on a foolish attack on f7 with my Knight. I do this a lot. You'd think I'd learn. But all is not lost...} Qd5 {Black must, of course, defend it.} 15. Bf5+ {This seemed to keep the initiative, but caution was needed while my King was still in the centre, with 15.Be3} Kb8 {The Black King is nicely driven to a safer square, something I'm sure Black thanked me for.} 16. O-O {While I do the right think at the wrong time. It's all downhill from here. I needed to keep my King in the centre, protecting the Queen, and after 16.Be3 Bxa3 (that pawn's falling whatever) 17.Qxd5 Nxd5 18.Rc2 I'm not too badly off. But instead, having got my King to safety (!) I embark on a series of totally flawed tactics that just undo my game.} Qxd2 {The Queen says thanks for the Bishop.} 17. Qxd2 {I go deeper in the mire, when 17.Nxf7 (I had, after all, gone to g5 with this in mind) Qxd1 18.Rfxd1 Rxd1 19.Rxd1 Rb8 20.a5 I've got a playable position. Maybe.} Rxd2 18. Nxf7 {Again, the right move at the wrong time.} Rg8 19. Nxe5 Bxa3 {Still just a pawn down, but all the momentum is with Black.} 20. Rcd1 {Maybe not the best way to get a Rook off your 7th rank, but I'm still, bizarrely, thinking of ways to win...} Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Bb2 {That pin is nasty...} 22. Rd3 {I defend the pawn, and hope that, somehow, the Knight can escape with check onto d7.} Re8 {Black slowly attacks each of my pieces and I don't have answers.} 23. Re3 {The thoughts of Nd7+, winning the Rook if (if) Black takes with his Knight come into my mind.} g6 {But Black is constantly harrying.} 24. Nd7+ Ka7 {It's a shame Black has this escape square - the result of that bizarre early pawn advance - or I could capture the Rook with check.} 25. Nxf6 {Since that's not an option I take the Knight instead. Even after 25.Rxe8 Nxe8 26.Be6 Bxc3 I'm probably lost, facing all those passed pawns; this just makes things worse.} Rxe3 26. fxe3 gxf5 27. Nxh7 {I really need to get my King across the board with 27.Kf2. Foolishly I have exchanged down to an ending I can't possibly win; I think my Knight will be able to hop across the board and stop the passed pawns even after Black has captured my c-pawn. I will only be a pawn down, after all...} a5 {Suddenly it doesn't seem so simple. The Bishop guards the Queening square too!} 28. Ng5 {The Knight is coming to the rescue! I plot his course...} a4 29. Nf3 {And eventually to b3 to guard the Queening square?} Bxc3 {Nope. I was lost long ago, but it finally sinks in. I shouldn't even bother playing endgames.} 30. Nd4 Bxd4 {Not even the swiftest h-pawn can stop Black's a-pawn, so I resigned. And even now I can't understand why Bb5 earlier on had to win the Queen.}
