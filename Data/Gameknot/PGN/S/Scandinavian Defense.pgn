1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defense, which I consider to be a less than optimal opening choice. Accurate play from White results in trouble early for Black. of the ~17,000 games in the GK database(World) White wins 41%, Black 29%, Draw 30%.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 a6 {This move was a shocker for me and takes us out of the world database, although it has been played ~60 time on GK, but with a 58%-36% edge to White. Had my opponent played something like Nf6 then my usual response would be Bd2, but now this move seems to score about even for Black. I decide to develop first with Bc4 and see what comes out of this new (for me) move. } 5. Bc4 Bf5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Bd2 {So far we're still in GK's database, with a 53%-40% edge to White. Nothing out of the ordinary yet, seemingly standard developing moves. } e6 {7... O-O-O may look tempting for black but it is rife with trouble after 8. Nd5. Yet due to the discovered attack on the queen, 7... e6 doesn't prevent 8. Nd5} 8. Nd5 Bb4 {Black doesn't want to move the queen due to the fork on c7, but blocking with the knight is better than blocking with the bishop. } 9. Nxb4 Nxb4 10. a3 {Now we see why, the pin on blacks knight would not be a problem if it was the bishop recapturing, as it could simply take on d2. } Nxc2+ 11. Qxc2 Qb6 {Better is 11...Qxa3, although black is in a hole now no matter what. } 12. Qc3 {Better is 12. Qa4  } O-O-O 13. Ne5 {Now even though White is low on defenders of d4, he is threatening Nxf7, winning more material. } Bg6 14. Be3 Qd6 15. Bd3 {Aiming to remover the defender of f7. } f6 {Black drops a pawn right....} 16. Bxg6 {....} fxe5 {....} 17. dxe5 {there. } Qd5 18. Bf7 {Not worried about the invasion of the Queen via Qxg2, looking to threaten the Black King and bring the game to a close. } Qxg2 19. Bxe6+ Kb8 20. Ke2 {Seemingly open, but well defended. } Qg6 21. Qc5 {The bishop may seem to be hanging, but in fact all subsequent lines to Qxe6 involve mate or an enormous material loss. 21...b6 is necessary to prevent the *immediate* intrusion of the White Queen. } Qxe6 22. Qa7+ Kc8 23. Qa8+ Kd7 24. Rhd1+ {Now Black's choice, mate or loss of material. } Ke7 {Mate it is. 24...Kc6 stalls the moment after 25. Rc1  Kb5 26. Qxb7  Qb6 27. Bxb6 cxb6  mate is coming, but still a few moves down the line. } 25. Qxd8+ Kf7 26. Rd7+ {Qxd7 results in a walking of the king towards the h file after Qxd7  Ne7 e6  Kf6 Bg5  Kxg5 Qxe7 ... while Qe7 results in a huge loss of material after Rxe7  Nxe7 Qxh8... } Kg6 {But this results in checkmate. } 27. Qg5# {}
