[Opening "French (C00), Schlechter variation"]

1. e4 {My opponent had white pieces and started with e4.} e6 2. d4 d5 {After e6, d4, d5 we have french defence. } 3. Bd3 {The variation played by white is called the Schlechter variation. } Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 {After Nf6, e5, Nfd7 was play, this position reminds me of Steinitz variation, but instead the knight on c3, white has the bishop on d3 } 5. Qg4 {Qg4, At the first glance, I thought this move is weird, why would white develop the queen so early in the opening? (I'm not sure if this is the main line) then I had a good look, realized that this move is not bad, because it stops me from developing my dsb, the queen also is now defending d4 and I can't really chase her away successfully, h5 would weaken my kingside. } c5 {C5, I decided to play solid opening, this is the most reasonable move in the position, attacking white center immediately, with the intention to play Nc6 or Qb6 next.} 6. c3 {C3 maintains the pawn chain, which is the best move.} Nc6 {Nc6 adding more pressure to white's center. } 7. Ne2 {Ne2 was play, this allows white to play f4 in the future, also that his queen would not be short on squares. } cxd4 8. cxd4 Nb4 {After the tension between the pawns was resolved Nb4 was played, trying to trade off white's lsb. } 9. Qg3 {Qg3, the bishop has no place to go, so it has to be protected. } Nxd3+ {Nxd3+, finally I got rid of the pesky bishop, which was aiming at my king side. } 10. Qxd3 Bb4+ {Bb4+ The queen is no longer attacking g7, this allows me to develop my bishop with check.} 11. Nbc3 O-O {Simply castling king side, safety first.} 12. Bd2 {Bd2 unpinning } f6 {f6 undermines white's center with the idea to open up f file. } 13. f4 {f4 defending the center. } fxe5 14. fxe5 {F file is now opened up, white can not castle king side. } Nb6 {Nb6, the knight was not doing anything on d7, now it's going to c4, which would be an excellent square. } 15. a3 Bxc3 {I had a proper look at Be7, but I didn't like it, because white would gain initiative, so I took the knight.} 16. Bxc3 {I think Nxc3 would be better, because after this move, white's bishop is now blocked by his own pawn.} Qg5 {I found this good move, Qg5, not only attacks the g2 pawn, but also stops white from castling queen side.} 17. Ng3 {White protects the g2 pawn with Ng3, maybe Qg3 could be played try to trade queens. His king is now exposed in the center. } Bd7 {Bd7, trying to get the lsb involved. } 18. Bd2 {Bd2 was played, attacking the queen and gaining some initiative.} Qh4 {my queen would be useless on e7 or d8, so Qh4 was played, keeping the queen active.  } 19. Be3 {Not sure why this move was played, surely castle queen side would be better, this move invites me to play Nc4} Nc4 {Nc4 forking the bishop and the b pawn. } 20. Bf2 {Bf2 preserves the bishop, maybe planning to play some discovered attack on my queen. } Qf4 {I think Nxb2 would be better, but I wanted to protect my queen first.} 21. O-O {white's king is now safe. } Rf7 {Planning to double the rooks on f file.} 22. b3 {B3 attacks my knight. Nb6 would throw my knight out of the game, so I have to find a move better than Nb6.} Qd2 {Qd2 was play, if white trades queens in this position after Nxd2 white would be in trouble.} 23. Qb1 {He avoided the queen trade. } Na5 {Na5 provokes white to play b4. } 24. Ra2 {Ra2 reasonable move, chasing my queen away.} Qg5 25. Re2 Bb5 {Bb5 skewers the rooks, but I overlooked Be3.} 26. Be3 Rxf1+ {Rxf1+ was played first, I was hoping white to recapture with his queen, if that happens, I would play Qg6 moving the queen out of the harm's way first and then capture the rook on e2.} 27. Nxf1 {White wisely recaptured with knight.} Qe7 {Qe7 was played, attacking white's a pawn.} 28. Ra2 Rf8 {Rf8 reoccupies the open file and adding pressure to the knight.} 29. Nd2 {Nd2, getting out of the attack and protecting f1 square.} Qh4 {I noticed that white's back rank is weak, so I played Qh4, if white moved his queen away from defending his back rank, Qe1 check would be troublesome for black.} 30. a4 Ba6 {I played Ba6 then immediately regretted playing it.} 31. b4 {yes because of this move, I thought I was in trouble and would lose a piece. } Bc4 {I played Bc4, well at least I can get a rook for knight and bishop, but then I remembered that white still have the back rank problem, after bxa5, Bxa2, the queen can't recapture, because Qe1+ would be devastating. } 32. Rc2 {white saw that and played Rc2, which is not an accurate move.} Bd3 {This move pins the rook to the queen.} 33. bxa5 Bxc2 {Queen still can't recapture due to the same problem. } 34. Qb5 {Qb5, this move was actually a blunder, but ironically I responded with a blunder move (Bxa4), I should have played Qe1+ check straight away, I thought after Qe1+ white can play Nf1, but I overlooked the move a6, which would be winning for me.} Bxa4 {Bxa4 same threat, if queen takes bishop then Qe1+ } 35. Qe2 Qd8 {Attacking white's a pawn.} 36. a6 {a6, hoping for bxa6} b5 {I could not allow this pawn exchange, so b5 was played, supporting the bishop } 37. Qg4 {White would obviously play Bh6 next, also white's queen is attacking my e6 pawn.} Qc8 {I played this sneaky move, protecting e6 while aiming for Qc1+, if white plays Bh6 next, it would be game over for him.} 38. Bh6 {And it happened, he forgot about his back rank completely, h3 should have been played...} Qc1+ {Qc1+ The knockout punch... There is no way out for white in this position. GG }
