1. d4 {This game was a over-the-board tournament game 40 moves in 2 hours plus an additional hour after 40 moves.  I played this game in Seattle, WA, at the Seattle Chess Club.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 {My attempt to play the Colle} c5 {  !} 4. c4 {Given the situation, I decieded to the play for a Queen's Gambit postion.} Bg4 {  !?  Well, certainly not bad but a move such as this is, indeed, a sign of an over-aggressive player.  And to a certain degree even 3...c5 is a sign.} 5. h3 Bh5 6. Nc3 cxd4 {Well, before I had time to play Pawn-g4, thus, eliminating the Light-square Bishop my opponent had the game go in his direction; notice the placement of his Bishop.} 7. exd4 dxc4 8. Bxc4 e6 9. g4 {  !?} Bg6 {Note: This was a tournament game and up to this point of the game, I had spent 35-minutes on 9 moves while my opponent (Black) had spent 5-minutes.  } 10. Qa4+ {I believed, since the Bishop on the g6-square was out of play, it to be irrelevant to hunt down the Light-square Bishop via Knight-e5.} Nbd7 11. Ne5 {  !     in order to play NxNd7...QxNd7 (forced) and B-b5.} a6 12. Bg5 Be7 {A fair move on his part.  I believe, psychologically, my opponent thought Pawn-b5 was a bad moved and I did also.  But the more I looked at the position the more I thought Bishop-g5 was a bad move!} 13. Bxf6 {Now I have used 60-minutes and my opponent only used 7-minutes!} Bxf6 14. Nxd7 {Now my strategy was based on the fact that the Black King hasn't castled yet.} Qxd7 15. Bb5 axb5 16. Qxa8+ Bd8 {I was content with trading Queen's if 16.)...Queen-d8 was played. Query: How do you think the postion would have been?} 17. Qa3 {Preventing my opponent from Castling!} Be7 18. Qa8+ Bd8 19. Qa3 {I was content with a draw.  This was an (or a?) over-the-board tournament game and I was practically exhausted in the above position.  I had no feasible plan to embark on.} Qc6 20. d5 {  !  Deflection} exd5 21. O-O Be4 {Now his bishop acts like a blocker!} 22. Nxe4 dxe4 23. Rfd1 Qa6 24. Qb4 Qa4 25. Qd6 {  LOL} Qa5 26. Qd7+ Kf8 27. Qxd8+ Qxd8 28. Rxd8+ {Black resigned.}
