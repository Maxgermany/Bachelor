1. e4 {Hi everyone!  In this game my opponent transposes the Ruy Lopez into the Fried Liver Attack.  This type of attack will lure Henry onto e6 before he has time to tuck himself away on the kingside.  Somehow he manages it.  White proceeds with his attack but leaves a vital pawn undefended.  This ushers in our familiar Chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey.  White had no escape.  So, how did it happen?  Well read on or look at the Gameknot Analysis below. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=25632898&fb=1&rnd=0.5978942071417577} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {3. Bb5 - Ruy Lopez} a6 {3. ...... a6 - main line defense.} 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3 d6 6. c3 Nf6 {6. ..... Nf6 - development.} 7. Ng5 d5 8. exd5 Nxd5 9. Nxf7 {9. Nxf7?! - interesting move - here we have the Fried Liver Attack!} Kxf7 10. Qf3+ Ke6 {10. .... Ke6 - if I want to hold on to my extra piece, then Henry must move to e6 to defend it.  Not a happy place for a king in the opening.} 11. O-O Nce7 12. Re1 g6 13. d4 Bg7 {13. ....... Bg7 - I try to ensure that if the e pawn falls it will be taken with a white pawn - this pawn will then protect Henry from a frontal attack!} 14. Bf4 Rf8 {14. ..... Rf8 - KR develops and pins the white bishop against the WQ.} 15. Nd2 Bb7 {15. ..... Bb7 - develops and defends the knight on d5.} 16. Qh3+ Kf7 17. dxe5 Kg8 {17. ..... Kg8 - castled by hand, wheew and double wheew!} 18. Bg5 Qe8 19. Bh6 Bxh6 20. Qxh6 {20. Qxh6 - bishop trade.} Qf7 {20. .... Qf7 - attacks f2 pawn.  White defends it but a few moves later will forget about it!} 21. Ne4 Kh8 22. Nf6 Ng8 {22. .... Ng8 - at this stage it is just to chase the WQ away.} 23. Nxg8 {23. Nxg8?? - this is the move which will effect white's demise.  I nearly recaptured but thankfully saw that the f2 pawn was hanging before hitting the submit button.  I pressed reset and then Qxf2 ........} Qxf2+ {....... CHEEEECK! Yup, here is Glenda in all her splendour.  White has only one move.} 24. Kh1 Ne3 {24. ..... Ne3!! - SPLAAT - this kills white stone dead.  With this counter-sac white can take the knight with either the rook or the queen but Old Matey will still descend on g2 due to Fou Leblanc sitting quietly and innocuously on b7 but also attacking g2.  White sees this and waves the white flag.}
