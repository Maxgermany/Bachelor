[Opening "Scotch (C45), Ghulam Kassim variation"]

1. e4 {I start out with e4. Very common } e5 {They respond with the same } 2. Nf3 {Nf3, another common move. } Nc6 {Nc6, another regular move in the King's pawn opening. } 3. d4 {This move is more unusual, but compared with The King's pawn opening, it is better, and compared to the King's Pawn Game, it is about the same, except with a higher draw rate.   } exd4 {... And he captures. } 4. Nxd4 {I was debating on whether I should do Scotch Gambit, or Scotch game, but I decided to Go with Scotch Game, as it has a higher win rate. } Nxd4 {Obviously. } 5. Qxd4 {And Queen captures back, while indirectly pinning down the darksworn bishop. ( Bishop Moves away, Qxg7 ) Usually, you should develop your Queen last, though. } d6 {Very Common response, but Nf6 is better. } 6. Bc4 {Developing.} Nf6 {Now, he does Nf6.} 7. Bg5 {I dunno why I chose that move. I guess I just favor pinning down knights.} Be7 {Nobody likes pinned knights, though.} 8. Nc3 {Nearly fully developed, now.} O-O {Of course. He castles. My opponent has a pretty bad position right now.} 9. O-O-O {I like Queenside better than Kingside.} Ne8 {... But I like my Bishop! :(} 10. Bxe7 {Moving back would have been kinda useless...} Qxe7 {Queen Recaptures.} 11. Nd5 {Threatening the Queen.} Qe5 {Of course. You try to exchange instead of giving up your Queen. He just blundered away your bishop, by the way. A better move would have been Qd8. Note that my opponent made this move very hastily.} 12. Qxe5 {Still think he did a dumb move, though.} dxe5 13. Ne7+ {They Take back, Then I play Ne7+! He will have a horrible game now.} Kh8 14. Rd8 {Now he'll definitely lose his bishop. He offered a draw, but I declined.} g6 {Just to let the king have some space, because there is nothing else he can do for the bishop.} 15. Nxc8 {Decided not to exchange rooks.} Kg7 {He probably didn't want to be smothered into one corner, and/or he might of been afraid of the possible attack with Bf7.} 16. Rhd1 {Bringing out my other rook and gaining 2 rooks on one file/ doubling up my rooks.} Nf6 {Now he wants to exchange!? That was a pretty decent move, though.} 17. Rxf8 Kxf8 18. Rd8+ {We both took, and I check now. It was either this, lose a pawn, or lose a knight.} Kg7 19. f3 {No taking my pawn!} a5 {Now he'll start moving the h and a pawn up.} 20. g4 {Stopping H pawn from trying to advance.} a4 {I really think there was a better move here, but, oh well.} 21. g5 Nh5 {Threaten knight, knight moves away, becomes isolated. Ng8 wouldn't have been any better.} 22. h4 {Protect my pawns.} c6 {Seriously, I was kinda expecting Nf4.} 23. b4 {Trying to avoid backing up my bishop.} b5 {Still need to move back...} 24. Bf1 Ng3 {Attack on bishop.} 25. Bh3 Ne2+ {I hate this Knight.} 26. Kd2 Nf4 {Attacking the Bishop Again.} 27. Bd7 Ne6 28. Bxe6 fxe6 {Simple exchange, though some rank bishop higher than knight.} 29. Rd7+ Kf8 30. Nd6 {Finally freed the rook and the Knight.} a3 {Advancement.} 31. Rxh7 {Extra pieces, and Black also has to worry about the possible rook skewer.} Kg8 32. Re7 {Threatening Pawn. } Rf8 {He does the same.} 33. Rxe6 Rxf3 {Pawn's taken.} 34. Rxg6+ Kh7 35. h5 {Scored two extra pawns already.} Rf2+ 36. Kc3 {Pawns are the key point in the middle-end and the end game.} Re2 {Threaten some more pawns.} 37. Rh6+ Kg7 38. Ne8+ Kf7 {They'll get a pawn back, now.} 39. Nf6 Rxe4 40. Rh7+ Ke6 41. h6 {Trying for promotion.} Rc4+ 42. Kb3 {Now I start Threatening his A pawn.} c5 {A adequate move.} 43. bxc5 Rxc5 44. Kxa3 Rxc2 {Only a pawn and a knight up after that. I thought it would be more, but at least Black will have a harder time winning.} 45. Nh5 {I could have done Kb4, but I decided to try to advance my pawns further.} Rg2 46. Rg7 Kf5 {Attacking pawn on G file now.} 47. h7 {h7!! Black is dead.} e4 {Trying to advance his pawn in hopes he can get there before my promoted pawn gets to it.} 48. h8=Q {Yay! Promotion. } e3 49. Qe8 e2 50. Rf7+ {Now onto Checking.} Kg6 51. Re7+ {Black is inevitable lost.} Kxg5 52. Rxe2 Rxe2 53. Qxe2 {Got the pawn, and the endgame officially starts. } Kf5 54. Qxb5+ {All pawns down, the best he can do is stalemate now.} Kg6 55. Kb4 Kf7 56. a4 Ke7 57. a5 Kd8 58. a6 Kc8 59. a7 Kc7 {Absolutely hopeless of even a stalemate, now. } 60. a8=Q {You know, my opponent offered a draw here. Well, promoting again. The a and h file pawns are probably the easiest to promote.} Kd6 {Only one place to go.} 61. Qac6+ Ke7 62. Qe5+ Kf7 63. Qg7# {And with that, the game is won. Good thing, too, because I was 2 minutes away from timing out. I wonder if there was a quicker checkmate... Well, if you find one, tell me!}
