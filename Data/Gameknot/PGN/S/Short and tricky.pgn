[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40), Englund gambit"]

1. d4 e5 {? An old system, never seen in serious chess, probably played by mistake!} 2. dxe5 Bc5 {Black assumes the game (I tried to offer draw, but it was too late). } 3. Nf3 h5 {? ...but interesting. In fact, I decided I could just ignore it. I want a pawn in h3, so no problem with that pawn. } 4. e4 c6 {? I understad, black wants to contest the center, but he is neglecting developement. I overlooked that he is opening the way for his Q to b6, TOO...} 5. Nc3 Qb6 {Uh-oh, I'm in trouble! Incredibe! This will be fun. The only reasonable answer is to block with my Q one of my B's path. Too bad!} 6. Qd2 {I sensed I better kept an eye on the d column, well aware of the black's attacking potential. } Na6 {? ... unfortunately, this move is not a good way to attack, since it essentially loses a piece. The Q and B battery is uncovered after Na4, and NxB will have neutralized black's power. } 7. Na4 {...but now, black has only one move to save the B, that IS en prise. After the Q retreats, BxNa6 will leave black with Bxf2+, KxB, bxBa6, with few compensation. Black had to play Qb4, in order to threat the WN and the Q's exchange at the same time, guaranteeing to maintain the balance. } Bb4 {? but this move plainly loses a piece... or not? The whole situation is thematic, and good for beginners to get used to. } 8. c3 {Now both pieces, Q and B, are threatened at the same time. It seems not to be any escape for black. } Qa5 {... but in fact there is one, and very good, indeed. This way, the BQ escapes and threats the Na4 in return. The balance will be mantained. } 9. cxb4 {...but again, the situation is not so simple. This is a kind of dangerous move (if not a blunder). White (I) should have taken the chance to develop with tempo with BxNa6. This just to make possible o-o, the beginning of the freedom. Now, the N will become a killer monster! Can you see?} Nxb4 {Threatening Nc2+! AND my Na4. Time to behave "cool blood fashion". } 10. Nc3 {This simple move counters all of black's threats. Now, a3 will solve all my problems... but the funny thing about this game is that after a black's horrible opening, I am the one struggling for coming out of problems! There is a theory chapter somewhere I didn't read! :-)} f6 {Thank to Archduke, who copied my post into the comments section so the diagrams can be seen...} 11. Bc4 {I prefer the castling than the pawn!} d5 {Black opens the game!} 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Bb5+ {Too time to go all this more deeply. But here, Bd2 allowed BxB+, KxB, exf6, followed by Ne5+. So black thought it was a good idea to avoid all this with...} Ke7 {...but it came out even worse!} 14. Nxd5+ {Black loses here both the N and the Q. You'll see!} Kd8 {? K anywhere elste that unter the WQ's look! :-)} 15. Nxb4+ Kc7 16. Nd5+ Kb8 17. Qxa5 {...:-) and, more over, there is no defence against Qc7#! A violent game, for sure...}
