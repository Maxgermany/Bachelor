1. e4 c5 {The start of the Sicilian defence.} 2. Nf3 {Preparing to fight over d4.  Also allows for a fight over e5 later on.} e6 {Supports development to d5.} 3. Nc3 {White switches focus to d5, supported by the e4 pawn.} Nc6 {More focus on d4.} 4. Bc4 {Further fighting over d5 by White.  The trouble with this is white has to wait for Black to start that fight and may risk being outmanouevred if Black pushes the kingside instead.} Bd6 {The Black LSB is now very restricted as is the black pawn centre.} 5. d4 {A line like 5. ... cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Bf8 looks very good for white.} Nf6 {Which is probably why black ignores it.  Black instead atacks the e4 pawn, although the c3 knight defends it adequately.} 6. d5 exd5 7. exd5 Ne7 {Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.} 8. Qe2 {Intending to pin the knight on e7, but the threat is rather hollow since Black can escape easily by castling (which he probably wants to do anyway) without hanging the knight.  Probably better was 8. Nb5 which leads to:  A: 8. Nb5 Bc7 9. d6 Bxd6 10. Nxd6+ Kf8 11. Nxf7 Qa5+ B: 8. Nb5 Bb8 9. d6 (after which White should win a piece at least) C: 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. Bd2 (due to the cramped queenside, this either hangs a piece or transposes into line D below) D: 8. Nb5 Qb6 9. a4 a5 10. Bb3 (intending to follow Nd2 Nc4 - probably winning for white but the sequence is long and it's hard to be sure how black will defend)} O-O {Black duly castles, unpinning the knight} 9. O-O {White's castle has three effects: it unpins the queen before a pin can form, it activates the kingside rook and it tucks the king away.} Qa5 {Seems weak to me.  Black's queenside is lightly developed and the black pawn on c5 blocks the queen from swinging quickly over to the active kingside.  9. ... B6 to prepare Bb7 and Re8 looks interesting to me, and with the white pawn on d5 so far ahead of its army, white might struggle to defend it easily} 10. Bd2 {Obviously preparing a discovered attack on the queen.} Qb4 {Meets the threat by posing a new one at b2 and c2 (as in 11: Ne4 Qxb2 12: Nxd6 Qxc2 although 13: Qxe7 looks good)} 11. Ne4 {Nb5 was better as it prevents Qb6 protecting the d6 bishop} Qb6 12. Nxf6+ gxf6 {The trade leaves Black with a damaged kingside pawn structure - not as useful as the reuslt of Nb5 would have been but better than nothing. The defences around the king are damaged by more than the attack thanks to the completely immobile lsb and a8 rook.} 13. Bh6 {Immediately, a threat on the f8 rook.  Gives good control over the important g7 square (Qg7 is mate now, thoguh White can't hit it yet).  White needs to watch for Nf5, perhaps through his own Nh4.} Re8 {The open file, threatening the queen, is the rook's natural home.} 14. Ne5 {Although this sacrifice ends up working, it's more down to poor defending than great attacking.  Bxe5 followed by f5 poses a stack of headaches for White.  Better was 14. Bd3, threatening Qe4 (though Black can defend with 14. Bd3 f5 15. Bxf5 Bxh2+ 16. Nxf2 Qxh6)} fxe5 {Undoubling the pawns, yes, but it also cripples the dark bishop and the e8 rook.  Black's piece activity is verging on nil here.} 15. Qe4 {The queen begins her meandering route to g7.  Giving check on the g file leads to Ng6, which leads to the dsb reaching f8.  Since black has some free pawns at b2 and c2 to focus on, he's unlikely to play these moves unprompted.} f5 {Attacks the queen, but doesn't do much else.} 16. Qh4 {Continues to hone in on the mating square.} Qxb2 {This was black's las chance to save the game. f6 leading to Nf5 is one option (although I think it drops a piece), but Ng6 should be best. As played Black is done.} 17. Qf6 {Mate is inevitable by move 20  A: 17. ... Qxc2 18. Qg7# (as played; Black 17 is irrelevant) B: 17. ... e4. 18. Qxb2 Bxh2+ 19. Kxh2 Kf7 (another irrelevant move, since nothing more can reach the a1-h8 diagonal, but this is probably the best of the bad bunch) 20. Qg7#} Qxc2 18. Qg7# {}
