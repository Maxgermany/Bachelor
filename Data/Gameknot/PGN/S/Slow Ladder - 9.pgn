[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 {I figured this would be another random game that I would lose since my opponent had more experience than me, but once again, I was wrong. Here is my opening I always start with.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 {I build up my defenses.} Bc5 {Not totally sure what this accomplishes, unless he wants my bishop...} 4. Be3 {Because I'll gladly give it to him.} h6 {Not what I expected. I guess he didn't realize his bishop was completely unprotected. He should of taken mine. } 5. Bxc5 {Now I have a slight early advantage.} d6 6. Be3 Nf6 {I already knew he was preparing to castle.} 7. g3 O-O 8. h4 Bg4 {He goes for my knight.} 9. Be2 {Not ready to get my queen involved just yet.} d5 {Would be better for me to attack than to wait for him to attack.} 10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Qd2 {Now I want my queen to get involved.} Qd7 {Apparently so does he.} 12. c4 {I want to drive back the knight, but this move didn't help.} Ndb4 13. Nh2 {I decide to save my knight and attack his bishop.} Bf5 {I can tell he doesn't just give up his pieces, which there's nothing wrong with that, but he'll have no choice as this game continues.} 14. a3 {I again go for the knight.} Bxd3 {??? His knight is wide open for a attack! This move really doesn't accomplish anything. 15. axb4 Bxe2 16. Qxe2, or better yet Qxd7 will result in a bigger advantage for me than what I currently have.   } 15. axb4 {So the knight goes.} e4 {He gives his bishop some protection. I didn't expect that.} 16. Bxd3 exd3 17. b5 {I give my b and c pawns some structure.} Ne5 18. b3 Rae8 19. O-O {I finally castle king-side. } c6 {He had no idea what was coming next.} 20. Bc5 {His f8 rook is gone.} Qh3 {If he is going for my rook, why??? If he takes my rook, his most powerful piece, the queen, will be gone. Along with that, the d3 pawn is now more vulnerable to attack.} 21. Bxf8 {So I take the rook.} Kxf8 {The bishop goes of course.} 22. Rxa7 {I finally realized how vulnerable the a7 and b7 pawns were.} Qc8 {A reasonable move.} 23. f4 {I line up to take the d3 pawn.} Nd7 24. Qxd3 {My plan works perfectly.} Nc5 {Not the best move.} 25. Qd6+ {Now his knight is lost.} Kg8 26. Qxc5 Kh7 27. bxc6 {I was hoping for 27. bxc6 28. Rxf7} Re2 {But he does this instead. Maybe he was trying to immobilize my king? } 28. Nc3 {I attack the intruder.} Rd2 29. Rxb7 {The b7 pawn is gone and the c6 pawn protects the rook.} f6 {He leaves the door open for a attack.} 30. Qe7 {I go for checkmate.} Kg6 {But he sees it.} 31. g4 {I greatly limit black's options here.} Qg8 {He just moved his queen in a space that won't help him out at all, thus his fate was sealed.} 32. Qe4+ {The only move black could make was 32. f5, which ultimately would of led to 33. Qxf5# With checkmate inevitable, white resigns and this wonderful game was over. After the game, claudioa wanted to know how I kept my rating so low. I was still fairly new at Gameknot at the time, but this game showed the hidden skills I can sometimes muster up. I hope you enjoyed this annotation!}
