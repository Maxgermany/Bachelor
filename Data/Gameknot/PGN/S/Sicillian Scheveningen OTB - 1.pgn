1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Small departure from the more common 2.Nf3} cxd4 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Both players transpose to very familiar position.  One name is the Moscow variation} 5. Nc3 a6 6. Nf3 {Not vital to return to knight to f3.  White losing tempi by moving the same Knight so often.} Nc6 7. Be2 e6 {Black prepares Be7 and with the two central pawns has the flexibility of moving to d5 or e5 later} 8. Bg5 Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. a3 b5 11. Bd3 Qc7 {Both players continue to develop but again White moves t.he same piece} 12. h3 Bb7 13. Qd2 Rfe8 {White was eyeing Bh6, while Black moved Rfe8 to take away the target and protect Be7.} 14. Nh2 {White wanted to place his Knight on g5, then advance f-pawn} Ne5 15. Bxf6 Bxf6 16. f4 Qc5+ {Black took some time over 14...Ne5 as he also considered d5. He said he knew f4 pawn move was coming after the Ke5 so the next choice was where to put the Queen for a check. Check to drive King away from defence of Rf1.  He said he chose the bolder Qc5 rather than Qb6, just to improve Black's presence in the center. } 17. Kh1 Nd7 {17.Ned7?? wrong move.  Capturing the strong bishop on d3 is a no brainer. Black said he wanted to land the Knight on the weak g3 square. But with this move Black is giving back all the advantage he gained and the Queen looks misplaced on c5. A protected Rook on f5 looks juicy.} 18. Nf3 d5 {With this move Black wanted to shake things up in the center.} 19. e5 Be7 20. Ne2 f6 {White starts to move his pieces to the Kingside. Black weakens his pawn structure to deal with the pressure.} 21. b4 Qb6 {Again, where to put the Queen.  It's looking after a weak pawn,it's not the job for a Queen.} 22. c3 fxe5 23. fxe5 Ref8 24. Ned4 Rf7 25. Qc2 g6 {Black is running out of squares and the slow build-up is undermining his defence} 26. Rf2 Raf8 27. Raf1 Rf7f4 {Black is looking at the f2 Rook to attack if his bishop goes to h4. White attack is slow in coming maybe a few equal exchanges will take the sting out of it.} 28. Qd2 Bc8 29. Qe1 Nb8 30. g3 {While White was fooling about with the Queen, offering no immediate threats.  Black contorts his pieces to protect and get them into a better attacking position. Bishop can take over from Queen, who intended to head for d8 to link with both Be7 and Rook.} Rf4f7 31. Qd2 Nc6 {calm before the storm} 32. Nxc6 {White felt he could attack with tempo if when moving the Nf3 in front of the doubled rooks.  But it didn't go the way he was expecting.} Qxc6 33. Nd4 {just to pause again, White expected the Black Queen to move.} Rf7xf2 34. Rxf2 Rxf2 35. Qxf2 Qxc3 {Black is has taken an advantage, with alot less pieces on the board.} 36. Bf1 Qxa3 37. Nc6 Bxb4 38. Nd4 Bc5 {White is helping Black at the minute.  Both players conscious of the time.  But White stopped thinking in the last few moves.} 39. Kh2 Qa1 {Black considered Qc3 and Qa1 because there the Knight can move and attack Queen but with a1 and c3 if 1. Knight moves Bxf2 2. Nxc3 (or Nxa1) Be4 and has won another pawn with tempo.  It's still a tricky endgame in time trouble, to Queen a pawn.  But with two Bishops every square can be covered.  In the post mortem it was pointed out Qa4 was out of danger of the Knight but Black wanted the Queen in a dominant position and a dark square meant less thinking time worrying about White's Bishop.} 40. Qf6 Qxd4 {White is on the precipice. } 41. Qd8+ Kg7 42. Qf6+ {Black took a bit of time on this, to check there was no substantive mating threat from Kh6.  The dual-purpose move h4 was been considered by White.} Kh6 43. Qh4+ {White decided to on the Queen exchange.} Qxh4 44. gxh4 b4 45. Bd3 a5 46. Bc2 Bd7 47. Kg2 a4 48. Kf3 b3 49. Bb1 a3 {Here White resigned}
