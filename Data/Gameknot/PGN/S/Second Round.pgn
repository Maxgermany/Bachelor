1. e4 {game with my very old and good friend.} e5 2. d4 {Center Game.} exd4 3. Nf3 {Qxd4 was main line. Black has two options now. Save the pawn. Don't save the pawn. There is no any reason/threat to not save the pawn. But Question is How i save my soldier? if 3. ... c5 then c3 dxc3 Nxc3  and Black got backward d pawn weak Q-side pawn structure back in development ... (Nc6 will transpose to Scotch Game)} Bb4+ 4. Nbd2 Qe7 {Is this move better than Nc6? or Black should play any other move?} 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. O-O {d-knight is free now. so it can move to b3 and pressure d4. also after a3 black bishop finds problems.  while b3 knight is solid at b3 ... so} Bxd2 {it is better to capture it now.} 7. Bxd2 Qc5 {this move makes Black back in development but if he wants to save pawn then this move is crucial because White could play Bb5, capturing N and then d pawn, this move also empty e7 square for g knight.} 8. Re1 {i think it is slow move.} Nge7 9. a3 Ng6 {Knight ... at its destination ... at right time.} 10. b4 Qb6 {Q continues to guard the d pawn.} 11. b5 Nce5 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 {if Black's knight was not at g6 at right time, things could be different.} 13. Bf1 c6 {?! this is slow move, Black should simply play direct c5. but this move was played with intention that, if White capture this pawn then makes his two  pawns isolated.} 14. a4 c5 {he is not going to exchange pawns.} 15. f4 Ng6 16. Qh5 {Black cannot castle, because kingside is under raid.} d6 17. e5 dxe5 18. fxe5 {better was f5 Ne7 and Rxe5 ...  Looking at this variation, im wondering where Black went wrong, or trying to save the d pawn was wrong ...!? } Qe6 19. Rac1 Qg4 {Black wants to exchange some pieces as this decreases some pressure.} 20. Qg5 {no matter, at what place u want to be killed ... :)} Qxg5 21. Bxg5 Bd7 22. c3 dxc3 23. Rxc3 {ok... conclusion upto now ... Advantages to Black Black has 'extra pawn' plus 'passed' White has one isolated pawn.  Advantages to White White has two bishops in open position.  2 plans either play h6, pushing bishop to less important square. but after h6 later if White wants to exchange his white bishop with knight then either black move the knight or he has to capture bishop with f pawn, and making white's isloated pawn ... passed and dangerous.  other idea is moving the knight right now ... } Nf8 24. Bh4 {(u know, c5 pawn is poisoned, as fork of knight, g5 bishop and c5 rook, so white moved bishop away to capture pawn now)} Ne6 {this maneuver of knight makes center solid, Black doesn't need to castle now,  as it is endgame it is better ... king in center. later or anytime knight can go to d4 ... a good outpost of knight. but temporary it blocks own bishop ...} 25. Rd1 b6 {giving hand to pawn as now knight is free to move.} 26. Bc4 h6 {! Black does not care of exchange of pieces. Actually Black want to exchange one of white's bishop as two bishops are dangerous ...} 27. Rd6 {i could not understand the reason of this move. if White wants bloodshed at e6 then he cannot be succeeded to win the blood. but if he wants Black to move his knight and win the f7 pawn then ok ... lets check it out ...} Nd4 {knight at best outpost, and door is closed for White Rook.} 28. Bxf7+ Kxf7 29. Rxd7+ Ke8 {now 2 threats. attacking rook and knight fork} 30. Rxd4 {White chose this option, but if he played 30. Rxg7 Ne2  or 30. Re7  Kf8 31. (King or c-Rook to anywhere to stop the fork then) g5 attacking bishop and rook ...} cxd4 31. Rd3 g5 32. Bf2 Rd8 {if White does not capture the pawn then it is saved, but if he captures with Rook ... RxP RxR BxR then Black King comes to e pawn and Rook goes to a4 b5 pawns ...} 33. Bxd4 Rf8 34. g3 Rf7 {coming to d7} 35. e6 Rf5 {if 36 White play e7 then Kxe7 will be blunder.}
