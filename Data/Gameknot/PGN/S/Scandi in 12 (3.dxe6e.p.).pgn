1. e4 d5 {Scandinavian Defense or Center Counter} 2. exd5 e5 {Boehnke Gambit of the Scandi. An obscure gambit where the originator escapes me. Who the hell is Boehnke?} 3. dxe6 e.p. {to remove a central pawn? any feedback is greatly appreciated.} Bxe6 {taking the pawn and developing the QB.} 4. c4 {??purpose of move is to open up the d1 to a4 diagonal file for later use? any feedback is appreciated about the purpose of this move by white.} Nf6 {preparing to o-o...} 5. d4 {another dubious move. he has a lot of moves in which to develop his pieces but......maybe to put a central pawn and open up the c2-h6 diagonal.} Bb4+ {preparing to castle with a check(gain of tempo)and a possible hidden check later on.(see move 8)} 6. Nc3 O-O {so there. black o-o.} 7. Nf3 {now trying to develop his pieces.} Re8 {threatening a discovered check. } 8. Ne5 {in order to vacate the f3 square for his queen after the Black N goes to e4. Bet he did not see Qxd4. Better move is 8.Be2.} Ne4 9. Qf3 Qxd4 {so there 2. the black Q is threatening to take the N on e5 and the other N on c3 after being captured by the BB.} 10. Nd3 {no other place for the N. 10.Bf4 is also bad; 10.Bf4 Bxc3ch and the situation rapidly worsens.} Bxc4 {removing the c4 pawn for another hidden discovered check and taking a pawn up to boot. the situation of white is very bleak from this point on.} 11. Be3 {whites strongest move but made too late. 11.Nxb4 gets the white Q; 11...Ng5ch.} Bxc3+ {12.bxc3 leads to mate; 12.bxc3 Qxc3ch 13.Bd2 Qxd2mate. 12.Kd1 leads to loss of the white N: 12..Nxf2  13.Qxf2 Rxe2  with the attack unabated.} 12. Bd2 {no other good move for white. 12.Kd1 Nd2 13.Nxf3 gxf3 14.Bxd4 Bxd4 winning the white B.} Bxd2+ {white resigned because he would lose material very rapidly;13.Kd1 Bxd3 14.Bxd3 Nxf2ch 15.Qxf2 Qxd3. lesson of the game is develop pieces early and most importantly, castle.(safety of the king is very important.)}
