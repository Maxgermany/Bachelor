1. d4 {Here is a game i played against parker1, which ends in a nice tactical idea from white.} d6 2. c4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 {Odd move. locks in his bishop.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. e4 {White has a very kings indian style of center here.} h6 {wants to avoid the pin on g5, but wastes time.} 6. Be2 {perhaps bd3 was better} b6 {another pawn move. white has a nice center and a lead in development} 7. Be3 Bb7 8. Qc2 {supports the e4 pawn} c5 9. d5 {This gains some space and locks blacks lsb in} a6 {nother pawn move?? black is seriously behind in development, while white is about the finish development} 10. O-O {White castles and connects his rooks finishing development.} Qc7 11. a3 Ng4 12. Bd2 Nde5 13. Nxe5 {here i just though that taking was easier than kicking the other knight} Nxe5 14. b4 {Perhaps this was a mistake} cxb4 15. Qa4+ {Cant play 15.axb4 because it would lose the pawn on c4} Kd8 {Black commits to not castling which will prove later as a bad choice} 16. Qxb4 a5 17. Qa4 Ba6 18. Nb5 {only way to defend the c-pawn} Qb7 19. f4 Nd7 20. Nd4 {heading for c6} Nc5 21. Qc2 Qd7 {i dont see the purpose of this move} 22. Bg4 {pinning the pawn to the queen} g6 23. f5 Bg7 24. Nc6+ Kc7 25. fxe6 {Here i had a nice idea. IF 25... fxe6 25.cxe6 Qxc6 26.Rxf7+ and after king moves 27.Rxg7. This appears to leave the pawn on e4 for grabs, but if 27... Nxe4 it would be answered by Bf4 winning a piece.} Qc8 {Blunder. This allows Rxf7+} 26. Rxf7+ {And my opponent resigns. At minimun hes going to lose his queen or get mated. Hope you enjoyed:)}
