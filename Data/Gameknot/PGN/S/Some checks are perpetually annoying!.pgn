1. e4 {Hi everyone, this was a Bury League game, the last game of the 1999 season in which ended on a fairly happy note for me, a draw against a higher rated player.  Have a good read!  Joanne} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 {4. d3 - this is the Guicco Pianissimo - the very quiet game.  Sometimes the following play may not be so quiet, however.} d6 5. Nbd2 Nf6 6. c3 O-O 7. O-O Bg4 8. b4 Bb6 9. Bb2 a6 10. Qc2 {10. Qc2 - unpins f3 knight.} Re8 11. Qb3 {11. Qb3 - piling up on the pinned f pawn.} Be6 12. Bxe6 Rxe6 {12. .............. Rxe6 - to avoid doubled pawns.} 13. Rae1 Nh5 14. d4 Rg6 15. dxe5 dxe5 16. Nc4 {16. Nc4 - I try to put my knight on an aggressive square.  This threatens the black e5 pawn and Nxb6 removing black's active dsb and doubling up his queenside pawns.} Nf4 17. g3 Qf6 18. Nxb6 cxb6 19. Kh1 {19. Kh1 - after the planned exchange on b6, Henry moves out of the pin by the rook on g6 and threatens the knight on f4.} Nh3 20. c4 {20. c4 - opens up a defensive battery on the f3 knight.} Rd8 21. Red1 Rxd1 22. Qxd1 {22. Qxd1 - it was necessary to take back with the queen as Rxd1?? would allow Rxf2  forking king and rook.  Note that Glenda is still defending the knight on f3 from her home square.} Nd4 23. Nxd4 Nxf2+ 24. Rxf2 Qxf2 25. Nf5 h5 {25. ................ h5 - strange move, misses knight fork on e7 winning a piece.} 26. Ne7+ Kh7 27. Nxg6 Kxg6 28. Bxe5 Qe3 29. Qb1 {29. Qb1 - guards e pawn but I think I throw away the win here by hanging on to extra material.} Qf3+ 30. Kg1 Qe3+ {30. ....................... Qe3  - here Kevin offers me a draw as there seems nothing better than to shunt Henry from h1 to g1.  I accepted it.  Little did I know that that would be the last time I would play in the Bury League.  Little by little I played fewer and fewer matches for my club.  I am still torn as to whether I should start playing in serious OTB chess matches again but feel I have enough on my plate with my correspondence chess.}
