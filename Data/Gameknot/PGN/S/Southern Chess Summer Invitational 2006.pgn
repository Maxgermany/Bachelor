[Opening "Queen's pawn (A40)"]

1. d4 {For those that know me, I play 1. d4 almost exclusively.} e6 {It is responses like this that drive me crazy. I'm pretty solid in most variations of the QGD and QGA, and black's response just took away my comfort zone.} 2. e4 {If he's giving, I'm taking.....} Nf6 3. Bg5 {I had numerous alternatives here, but decided to start the tactics early.} h6 {Attempting to drive the bishop back.} 4. Bxf6 {I don't know if that is best.  4. Bh4 seems safe because 4...g5 5. Bg3 seriously weakens black's kingside. I can always be counted on to take the greater of two evils.....} Qxf6 {Of course...} 5. a3 {Preparing for a queenside pawn push, and limiting black's dark squared bishop.} Nc6 {Hitting d4 twice.} 6. Nf3 {Developing, and equalizing on d4.} e5 {Solid.....to take gives black a much more spacious position after 7. dxe Nxe 8. NxN QxN. So I push....} 7. d5 Nd8 {This kind of surprised me, as I thought black would accept doubled pawns after 8...Nd4 9. NxN exN.} 8. c4 {The queenside pawn chain advances nicely.} Bc5 {Black kind of had to do this to catch up in development. I wondered if he saw that I could now exchange a knight for a bishop and double his pawns after what follows......} 9. b4 Bd4 10. Nxd4 exd4 {Mission accomplished. There is absolutely no hurry to retake that pawn. It's not going anywhere.} 11. Bd3 {A move that develops, protects, and prepares for castling. The only problem is that it doesn't threaten anything.} Qg5 {? A mistake I feel. Black is woefully behind in development and space. 11...d6 or 11...0-0 was probably better.} 12. O-O d6 {Black is hoping to play Bh3 next....} 13. f4 {What was it Tsun Tsu said? When your opponent is vulnerable, agitate him? Since black's dark squared bishop is off the board and I couldn't see his queen getting to the open diagonal to my king in time, I didn't think this was too risky.} Qg6 14. e5 {!There is the move we all just love to make. Black must now scamper to safety while white freely develops and continues to threatens black's queen.} Qg4 15. Be2 Qh4 16. Qxd4 {Now it's safe to take the pawn.} h5 {Black sees that he is in trouble and decides that he has to make something happen.  Either an outright pawn storm or getting a rook to g file is what he is thinking, I can only assume.} 17. Nd2 {White completes development. Notice that black is seriously behind in his own development.} Qe7 {I'm not sure what that was about. I envision pinning his queen against his king, as this is a half open file.} 18. Rae1 dxe5 19. fxe5 Qg5 {?Black hangs on to the idea of playing Bh3.} 20. Ne4 {So I harrass him yet again.} Qe7 {Black has just wasted time.} 21. c5 {With hopes of ramming pawns right down his throat.} a6 {Perhaps 21...b6 was better, liberating the bishop somewhat or creating a square for the knight.} 22. Bc4 {! A strong move that half way unlocks the Re1 and aims at a potentially weak f7.} Qd7 {Black's queen is due for her 3000 mile oil change.} 23. Ng5 {Look at the firepower on the e and f  files, as well on f7 in particular.} Qg4 {Black obviously sees a lot of pain coming his way, so he offers to exchange queens. I'm thinking at this point he wants to get his rook into play after 24. QxQ hxQ. } 24. Qxg4 hxg4 {I figure "why not?" Black doesn't have enough ammo to be of any real threat, and I can remove that pesky (and surely tired) queen off the board while resuming my central assualt.} 25. d6 {While this move frees up his knight somewhat, the threats on f7 are now overwhelming.} g3 {? Black could still castle.} 26. h3 {Nullifying the annoying threat.} a5 {? Castling was better.} 27. Nxf7 {And the fireworks begin.} Nxf7 28. Rxf7 b5 29. Re7+ Kd8 30. Bxb5 Rf8 31. Bc6 {Cutting off any ideas of black getting this rook into play after an exchange of his a pawn.} Ra6 32. b5 Rxc6 33. bxc6 {An exchange I happily make.} g5 34. e6 cxd6 35. cxd6 Bxe6 {The fat lady is warming up her chords......} 36. Re7xe6 g4 37. c7+ Kd7 38. Re6e8 Rxe8 39. Rxe8 Kxd6 40. c8=Q {And black resigned. Black's failure to develop and get castled cost him dearly in this one. I can only hope to get so lucky again in my next game against him!}
