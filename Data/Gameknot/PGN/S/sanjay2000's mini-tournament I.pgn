1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Nbd7 5. Nf3 c6 {Most common book line to this point} 6. e4 {My mistake, better is e3, thought I might be able to close the center with an advantage in pawn structure, but you played it well} h6 7. Bh4 dxe4 8. Nxe4 g5 {I was expecting Bb4, this move put me on my heels for the next few moves} 9. Nxf6+ Qxf6 10. Bg3 Bb4+ {Blocking with the knight loses a pawn at least, forced the uncomfortable Ke2} 11. Ke2 {I think this move let me off the hook, by fortifying my bishop in the center and leading to the Q exchange.  I haven't analyzed but b5 or c5 might have been better} g4 12. Ne5 Nxe5 13. Bxe5 Qf5 {Need to defend mate by Qe4} 14. Qd3 O-O {A little passive, if you are going to allow the queen exchange, Qxq, kxq, rg1, looking to queenside castle and work pinned pawns in the middle} 15. Qxf5 exf5 16. a3 Be7 17. h3 f6 18. Bf4 h5 19. hxg4 hxg4 20. Kd2 Rd8 {Get your bishop out, so that your rooks can get to d and e columns.} 21. Kc3 Bf8 22. c5 Be6 23. Bd3 Rde8 24. Rh5 Bg7 25. Bxf5 Bxf5 26. Rxf5 Kf7 27. Rh5 Re2 28. Bg3 Kg6 29. Rhh1 {I wanted the doubled rooks on h but the f pawn and you rooks were too dangerous} Rae8 30. Rad1 f5 31. Rhg1 f4 32. Bxf4 Rxf2 {Probably should have played g3, leading to Re2, Rd2, rxd2, Bxd2, Bxd4, kxd4, Rxd2+, kc2. Thought I could hold the pawn but instead blew out my position.} 33. Bg3 Re3+ 34. Rd3 Rxd3+ 35. Kxd3 Rxb2 36. Be5 {I think your better to play Rb3+, than to create a passed pawn.  I beleive you had a winning position that now I can force to draw ( or try to win)} Bxe5 37. dxe5 Rb3+ 38. Kd4 Rxa3 39. Rf1 Ra2 40. Kd3 {}
