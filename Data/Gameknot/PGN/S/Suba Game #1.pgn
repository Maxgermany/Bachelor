[Opening "English (A22), Bellon gambit"]

1. c4 {GM Mihai Suba is an excellent GM who's played a lot of strange ideas, and frequently pulls out oddly spectacular victories.  In this game he takes black against GM Raicevic.  He begins the game with a speculative gambit and quickly gains a developmental advantage.  His pieces find ingenious ways to march forward, and he wins in nice style.  I recommend flipping the board as Suba plays black and having a board at your side while watching this so that you can analyze variations.} e5 {Suba played the English as white to great success.  While most of his finds are for white, this is a great game against his favorite first move.  I'm going to skim over the opening.} 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 e4 {Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.} 4. Ng5 {White targets the weak pawn.} b5 {This is Suba's idea, the Bellon gambit.  If white takes black will get a good game via 5.cxb5 d5 or 5.Nxb5 I think is met by 5... c6 with ...d5 to follow, but maybe 5... Bb7 is a more natural continuation.  I think white's best response is 5.d3 where white is solid and black's pawns will soon look weak.  I initially wrote the awful idea of 5.Nxb5 d5?! 6.cxd5 Qxd5?? but that hangs a queen to 7.Nxc7 .  I got a bad rating off this, and I apoligize as it was a silly mistake to make.  I hope others won't rank it as harshly for one silly (but now corrected) blunder in the analysis.} 5. Qc2 {White adds pressure to e4 while adding a potential defender to c4.} bxc4 6. Ngxe4 Bb7 {Black develops with tempo against e4.} 7. Nxf6+ Qxf6 8. Qa4 {A reasonable move as black cannot defend c4, however, maybe white does better to play the solid 8.e3.} Bc5 {Black continues to develop with threats.} 9. e3 O-O 10. Qxc4 Bb6 {So, after ten moves white is up a pawn, but his bishops looks AWFUL.  Black's got two potentially useful files, a nice pair of bishop and an active queen.} 11. Nd5 {However, the developed queen can also prove a weakness, white forks queen and bishop.} Qd6 {Black does not want to trade his light squared bishop for black's knight, the light one is better than the dark, because the dark squared bishop's diagonal has been blunted by the pawn one e3.} 12. Nf4 {White is forced to make a decision with the knight, but I think this is a bad choice.  I think white should trade, getting rid of one of black's bishops.  Maybe I'm wrong though, as white will have an awful time developing and black has a great a file.} Re8 {Black continues development and adds a little pressure to the knight on f4.} 13. Be2 Nc6 14. O-O {Black has basically concluded development (as opposed to white who has an embarassingly bad bishop on c1) and he now goes for the attack, the two bishop are pointing menacingly towards the king and the rest of the pieces now enter the attack with the following excellent move.} Nd4 {The knight should not be taken as after 15.exd4 Qxf4 and black has targets on d4 and e2.} 15. Bd1 {White retains his pair of bishops, but he only has two pieces off the back rank.} Re4 {The knight still shouldn't be taken and white threatens the queen (16... Nf3  would win the white queen).  Suba continues to develop with threats.} 16. Qc3 Rae8 {And now black has concluded development.} 17. Nh3 {The knight moves away, now black's knight is attacked but white's one developed piece (besides his queen) is now a knight on the rim, commonly known to be a weakness.} Qg6 {But once again black manages to retain his powerful knight on d4.  The knight is still safe as 18.exd4?? Qxg2 ! 19.Kxg2 Rg4#.} 18. f3 {White must shut down the h1-a8 diagonal.} Rh4 {And as always, the knight has no need to retreat as black would take back with the bishop, winning black's queen with a royal fork.  Black also brings to the kingside with the threat of ...Rxh3 as the g pawn is pinned.} 19. Kh1 {The king sidesteps the pin, so the knight on d4 is (finally) forced to retreat.} Nf5 {But it stays on the kingside.} 20. d4 {Trying to keep the dark squares defended.} Qe6 {This is either a weak move, or an extremely clever move.  Black's queen intends to find a home on h6 but first it pressures e3.  However white gains a free tempo attacking black's queen, maybe though white's next (developing) move actually brings his bishop away from it's defensive duties.  It turns out that this idea proves extremely useful later.} 21. Bb3 {Looking back from move 29, I think that 20... Qe6 is one of the most fantastic moves of the game.  It acted as a decoy to bring the bishop away from it's defensive square on d1.} Qh6 22. e4 {The natural response, a fork that makes the queen look extremely exposed on h6.  However Suba has the game in control.  The following sacrifices shatter white's kingside.} Ng3+ 23. hxg3 {After 23.Kg1 Ne2  forking king, queen bishop and even pawn on d4 should leave the advantage in black's hands.} Rxh3+ {And the kingside cover is blown, so he flees.} 24. Kg1 {After 24.gxh3 Qxh3  I assume Suba wouldn't've taken the prepetual, but would've played 25.Kg1 Qg3  26.Kh1 Re5!! threatenening 27... Rh5# and when the rook is taken 28.dxe5 Qh3# because the dark bishop has once again entered the game.  This would've been a fabulous finish but the attack still retains interest.} Rh1+ 25. Kf2 Rxf1+ 26. Kxf1 Qh1+ 27. Kf2 {So, after a few checks white seems to have diluted some of the attack.  How to continue?} Ba6 {Black's bishop had lost value on b7 (it was stuffed by the pawn chain) and it now finds a new way to take part in the attack.} 28. g4 {Giving the king luft (space) against ...Qf1 .} Bf1 {However, Suba finds better thatn 28... Qf1  where black might escape.  This move wins g2 and brings the attack back to life (not that it had died, it just looked stymied for a moment).} 29. Bd1 {The bishop tries to return to the defensive square it was coaxed out of by 20...Qe6!} Qxg2+ 30. Ke1 d5 {Now black has equalized material (which seems somewhat unimportant now) and he adds pressure to the e file.} 31. Be3 {This may lose a pawn, but it closes the e file with a following f4.} dxe4 32. f4 {Now Suba is up a pawn but the attack is still more important.} Bd3 {An excellent outpost for the bishop that takes it out of harms way. } 33. b4 {Trying to stop ...c5! which would allow the dark squared bishop to enter the game with devastating effect via Bd8-h4.} h5 {This odd looking move follows the same plan.  When the pawn is taken white loses the ability to block the bishop's maneuver with g5.  Another spectacular move and a very tough one to see, at least for me (hey, that rhymed!).} 34. gxh5 c5 {This second pawn sacrifice lets the bishop take it's desired path of d8-h4.} 35. h6 {Hoping to complicate.} cxd4 36. Qc6 {One last complication.} dxe3 {A great reply!  Who needs the rook when black mates with Qd2# or Qf2#.  Black resigned here.  I hope you enjoyed this spectacular, and ever insightful attack.  The gambit led to good compensation and he always found astonishing ideas to keep the attack going.  If you have any comments or criticisms I'd love to hear them.  I think studying the way ideas are formed around use of pieces and tactical plans could greatly help almost anyone's play.  I hope to study and improve from this game more when I have time.  Honestly, I think this is one of the most phenomenal games I've ever seen and I hope I gave it justice here.  If you give a low rating please tell me why.}
