1. e4 {In this particular game, I remembered not to get nervous or angry after making blunders.  Instead, I remembered Jack Stockel's advice to remain calm by fixing the mistake, looking for a way out of trouble, finding the opponent's weakness, and spotting his blunder.      } Nc6 {He probably made this move to develop his minor pieces right away, and I understand because I used to do the same thing immediately.  However, I learned, from Jack Stockel, that it is good to develop minor pieces during the beginning game but not on the first move.  Otherwise, it destroys the center, prevents one from controlling the center.} 2. Bb5 {Now, it is ok to develop minor pieces and control the center.  Normally, I was told that it is usually better to develop the knight before the bishop, but there are exceptions.  In my opinion, this was one of those exceptions, and it was, actually, !  That is because Jack Stockel told me that, "Knights could be more dangerous then bishops", and I believe that his knight is extremely dangerous, in this position. } b6 {If he had played Nd4, there would not have been an exchange, and I would have been forced to move my bishop away from danger.  That is because he would have threatened to capture my bishop with Nxb5.  On the other hand, an even exchange is not bad because there have not been captures, so the score is still 0.  Now, I will force the exchange with Bxc6, followed by dxc6.} 3. Bxc6 dxc6 4. Nf3 {I respond by transposing the King's Pawn Play or Ruy Lopez opening into the King's Knight Opening.} Nf6 {Now, he threatens to capture my pawn with Nxe4, but I am not about to let that happen.} 5. Ne5 {I had three options to handle this situation, and two of them would protect the pawn.  Two of these options will become my candidate during the game.  First, I could protect the pawn with d3, but I did not want to do this because it is, "pushing", the pawn.  Second, I could also protect the pawn by bringing my other knight into play with Nf3, and I thought that this option was !?  Third, this option was one of my candidates, but it does not protect the pawn.  If he captures my pawn with Nxe4, I simply respond by capturing his pawn with Nxc6.  In my opinion, this was .} due to the position.  If this exchange had occurred, his weak pawns on the c square would have given him a tactical disadvantage, but this does not happen.} Bb7 {He made this move to protect his pawn on c6 and form a, "Fianchetto", but that does not bother me.} 6. O-O {I simply respond by castling, but this is ? because he could have captured my pawn with Nxe4, but I would not have been able to recapture his pawn with Nxd6 because of his bishop on b7.  However, I am lucky because he does not do this, and I still have a chance to fix this problem.} e6 {I am not sure why he chose that candidate.  Instead, he could have captured my pawn with Nxe4, but I am fortunate.} 7. Nc3 {I had mentioned earlier that I had three options, and Nc3 was not my best move.  However, this was now .} because it was the only way to correct my last blunder.} Bd6 {Now, he threatens to capture my knight with Bxe5, but I am not scared since this is not a pin.} 8. Ng4 {Therefore, I simply move my knight away from danger.   } a6 {I do not know why he made that move.} 9. e5 {I could have forced the exchange, but it was !? because there was a better option.  What was the option?  The fork between his bishop on d6 and knight on f6.  After this move, there is an exchange, starting with Nxg4.} Nxg4 10. Qxg4 {I decided to take his knight with my queen, instead of his bishop with my pawn because I do not want to let him fix his bad pawns on the c square.  If he played, cxd6 that would have happened, but this was ?.  } Bxe5 {If I had captured his bishop, my score would be a +2.  Due to this blunder, I am now at -1, but I was not going to get angry or worried about this mistake.  That is because Jack Stockel has said, "Don't get nervous.  Try to find a way out of trouble".  I was also determined not to get mad because it is a distraction.  In fact, I lose more concentration with rage then stress.  It is extremely likely that I would have lost this game immediately, if I became enraged.  That is because I would have attempted to force my way through by rushing, if I was angry.  Instead, I remained brave and figured that I might be able to stay in and last through the game if I stayed calm, and that will happen.} 11. b3 {I chose this candidate because he cannot win a free knight with Bxc3 because of my pawn on d2.  This will bring me one step closer to connecting my rooks.} O-O {It is usually a good idea to castle here, but this was not a good time to castle.  That will be explained on move 12.} 12. Ba3 {Normally, I would play Bb2 and form a, "Fianchetto", but that did not happen.  However, this move was .} In this position, I now threaten to capture his rook with Bxf8.  If that happened, his rook would be exchanged for my bishop, at best.  Therefore, he would only have two choices.  He could play c5 or Re8, but I will still achieve my goal here.} c5 {This is what he decides.} 13. Rae1 {Yes, this is what I wanted to do because my rooks are now connected.  However, this was ?  Instead, I should have played Rae2.} Bf6 14. Ne4 {I figured that this candidate was the best way to protect my pawn on d3, but I was wrong.  Instead, I should have played Rd1.  Now, he will get a free pawn after the exchange, and I will be at -2.  I am referring to Bxe4 followed by 15.Rxe4, Qxd2. } Bxe4 15. Rxe4 Qxd2 16. Re2 {Despite my mistake, I am determined to follow Jack Stockel's advice by not resigning in the game.  Therefore, I protect my pawn on c2 with my rook.} Qa5 {In this position, he is forced to move his queen away from, "harm's way", but he threatens to capture my bishop with Qxa4.} 17. Qa4 {This protects my bishop and forces his queen to escape.  Of course, I could have forced an exchange with Qxa5 followed by bxa5, but I did not want to do this and give him another pair of doubled pawns.  That is because I learned from i have arrived that doubled pawns can be good, if they are not captured.  I did not want to give him that advantage because I knew that I would not be able to recapture his doubled pawns.} Qb5 {He is now trying to get his queen away from danger, but I am not going to let that happen.} 18. c4 {I respond by attacking his queen with two pieces.  I am referring to the pawn on c4 and my queen on a4.  If I am guessing correctly, this is a reversed fork.   } Qe8 {Now, he retreats with his queen, but I will force an exchange with Qxe8 followed by Rfxe8.} 19. Qxe8 Rfxe8 20. Rd1 {I chose this candidate to put pressure on the d square.  That will be explained on move 21.} a5 {I am not sure why he made this move.  In this position, c6 would have been better.} 21. Rd7 {That is because I now threaten to capture his free pawn with Rxc7.  If this happens, he will be in bad shape because he has two pawns on the c file, but he corrects this blunder.} Re7 {At this point, he will force an exchange with Rxe7 followed by Bxe7.} 22. Rxe7 Bxe7 23. Rd2 {In this position, my goal is to play Rd7 so that I could threaten to capture his free pawn with Rxc7.  This time, however, he immediately figures out my plan and does not make the same mistake.} Bd6 {Instead, he responds with his bishop.} 24. Bb2 {I do not remember why I made this move.} f6 {I do not know why he chose that candidate, but he corrects this blunder.} 25. Re2 {I want a free piece instead of an even exchange because I am, "down material", and Jack Stockel has told me that a free piece is generally better then a mere exchange.  Therefore, I threaten to capture his pawn with Rxe6.} e5 {He corrects the blunder by protecting his pawn.} 26. Re4 {In this position, I do not see how anyone can win.  Consequently, I simply offer him a draw, and he accepts the draw offer.  There is a highest rating won against and a lowest rating lost.  Well, this was my second highest rating drawn against, and my highest rated draw was against Jack Stockel, my chess coach, in three or four different games.  Therefore, this was one of my best games, ever, and my best game on this site. }
