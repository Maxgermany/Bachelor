1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favor among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to equalize without difficulty. More recently the Scotch has regained some popularity and it has been used by grandmasters Kasparov and Timman as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analyzed Ruy Lopez.  White aims to dominate the center by exchanging his d-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Black usually plays 3...exd4, as he has no good way to maintain his pawn on e5.} exd4 4. Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nb3 Bb6 6. Nc3 Nf6 {Fritz suggest 6. Qf6 with a mate threat after which the position is equal.} 7. Qe2 O-O 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 a5 10. a4 Nd4 11. Qd3 Nxb3 12. cxb3 Re8 13. O-O-O d6 14. Qc2 {White is planning to develop his lsb to c4 or can play his knight to d5. Black should control the d5 square.} Bd7 15. Bc4 Be6 {Black plays this one move late.} 16. Rhe1 Qe7 {Black does nothing to release the pin on his f6 knight. This will prove to be a costly error. 16. g5 was necessary. White is in full control of the center.} 17. e5 {a bit premature. 17. f4 followed by 18. e5 would have been better.} dxe5 18. Rxe5 {Now, Black's knight on f6 and bishop on e6 are both pinned.} Qf8 {Black releases the pinned pieces but at a disadvantageous position. His king side castle will be torn open.} 19. Bxf6 gxf6 20. Re2 Qg7 {A dangerous place for the Queen in front of the King while White Rooks can occupy the g-file.} 21. Bxe6 Rxe6 22. Rxe6 fxe6 23. Rd3 {White Rook is ready to swing over to the g-file.} Kh8 24. Rg3 Qh7 25. Qd2 Bc5 {Bishop is rushing to his king's defense.} 26. Ne4 Be7 27. Rh3 {A critical position. White pressure on the h6 pawn seems to be deadly. Black chooses a weaker defense on his next move.} Kg7 {? loses quickly. Better was 27...Rd8 28. Qe3 Bf8 29. Qc3 e5 30. Qf3 Be7} 28. Qd7 {White occupies the 7th rank.} Kf7 {? second mistake. Kh8 was better.} 29. Ng5+ {Piece sacrifice to open lines.} fxg5 30. Rf3+ Kg8 31. Qxe6+ Kh8 32. Rf7 {Now White wins back more than his sacrificed piece.} Bd6 33. Rxh7+ Kxh7 34. Qf7+ Kh8 35. g3 {To stop a check from f4.} Ra6 36. Kb1 Bb4 37. f4 gxf4 38. gxf4 {Black resigns.}
