1. e4 {A brilliant game ! I try to anotate although I do not have the level.} c5 2. c3 d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 {agressive beginning} 4. d4 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bf5 {Probably to avoid 6.Bd3, for black doesn't want to play c4} 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Nbd2 {Enabling 8. Bc4 but closing the d file for the queen. Would Na3 have been better ?} cxd4 8. Bc4 {The black queen has little place to go and there is a danger for black on f7.} dxe3 {Queen sacrifice !? The computer doesn't consider it as a mistake, so that it has to be !!} 9. Bxd5 {Why not accept the gift ?} exd2+ 10. Qxd2 {If 10. Nxd2 Nxd2 and material value is equal but black is better in developpement} O-O-O {Pinning the LSB} 11. c4 e6 {logical attack} 12. Qf4 {Unpinning the bishop and menacing to exchange bishops if black plays 13... exd5} Bb4+ {Just to prevent black to castle} 13. Ke2 {Almost forced} Bd6 {Black wants to send the white queen away from the LSB to take on d5} 14. Qg5 {Only move to carry on menacing the LSB} h6 {! sacrifying a pawn} 15. Qxg7 Nh5 {sacrifying another pawn.} 16. Qxf7 {Critical point of the game : White has a strong material advance (partly compensated by the fact that white will take the LSB) Black's pawn structure is terrible but : White will quickly be out of the center The white king is extremely weak Black pieces are more active and better connected ( The white queen is alone and in danger) Black has a rook on the central open file.  } Nf4+ 17. Kd1 {White has little other choice (because of black's bishops)} Rhf8 18. Qg7 {Only square for the queen} exd5 {Finally black takes the bishop and is evidently better now because white's rooks are blocked.} 19. c5 {White needs to keep the d5 pawn on the d file to block black's d rook} Bc7 {I had trouble to understand this move (19... Bxc5 is so tempting and evident). Black probably wants to avoid the pin of his c knight by the a rook) } 20. Rc1 {freing the rook} Rfg8 {Black harasses the queen again...} 21. Qxh6 {... and sacrifice a pawn} Nxg2 {Not taking with the rook, for this menaces fork attack by a further Bf4} 22. h3 {To prevent 22... Bg4 pinning the knight.} Bg6 {Again a move that I have had trouble to understand but for white 23. Rg1 is not possible fr the white queen would be trapped (23... Bf4 and the queen has no escape)} 23. Qd2 {Only safe place for the queen (23.g4 means death because of 23... Bc2+)} Bf4 {Is this move, the reason of19... Bc7, 4 moves ago ?} 24. Qc3 {alternative move was :24. Qe2 but it would allow 24... Re8} d4 {Blak carries on harassing the queen instead of taking the c rook} 25. Qb3 {I was asking myself why not Qc4.} Bh5 {Now I can see why the white queen is better on the 3rd line.} 26. Kc2 {Not sure about this move. It joins the rooks and white is planning to hide in b1 but masks the c rook and enable black's next move.} d3+ 27. Kb1 Bxc1 {finally black takes the rook.} 28. Qe6+ {desperate counterattack} Kb8 29. Ne5 {Only place to save the knight.} Bf4 30. Nxc6+ bxc6 31. Qxc6 {A good exchange for white.  } d2 32. Qb5+ {White is playing for the draw.} Kc7 {If black stays on the 8th line, he is facing perpetual chess} 33. Qa5+ Kc8 34. Qa6+ Kd7 35. Qa4+ {If white takes the a pawn (35. Qxa7+, black plays 35... Ke8 and the game is over.)} Ke6 {Why not 35... Ke7 ? Probably because if 35... Ke7 36.Qe4 Be5 and white has a chance to give perpetual chess...} 36. Rd1 {White sees that he cannot give perpetual chess so that he has to block the pawn.} Bxd1 37. Qxd1 Ne1 38. c6 {What a brilliant game ! I've learned a lot, trying to anotate it. Thanks to both players}
