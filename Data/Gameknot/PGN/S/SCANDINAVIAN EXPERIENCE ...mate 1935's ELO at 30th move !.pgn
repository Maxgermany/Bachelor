1. e4 d5 {if the gambit is accepted, i will take whith the queen and after 3.Nc3, i will play Qd6 to keep occuping the center (but i'm afraid because it looks risky, i whould not loose the queen !...)} 2. exd5 {accepted ! Theory seems to says that is not the better way for white, is it ?...} Qxd5 {now i'm occuping the center, i'm more developped than white, i have the initiative, so this must be chess playr's paradise ! } 3. Nc3 {problems coming...} Qd6 {this was my resolution, the experiment this position. i think it's quite good, because the queen can move where ever she whant.  i just have to be very carefull and never forget to develop before it become to late...} 4. d4 {white develop maybe preparing a to soon atack like Nb5 ? i dont care, i attack d4 !} Nc6 5. Be3 {defending an developing,  i'm getting late, i should develop also } Bf5 {in way to move Nb4 ...Nc2 it's alway good to threat a good challenger, so he does not bore !...} 6. Bd3 {developig AND defending, things are becoming serious ...} Bg6 {now if he dont exchange the bishop, i will ! and then white will find some difficulties :  7.... - Bxd3  8. c2xd3 - Nc6xd4 9. Be3xd4 - Qxd4  or if  7.... - Bxd3  8. Qxd3 - Nb4 ...etc } 7. Bxg6 {so white take my g6 bishop and i take back whith the queen treathening Qxg2 ...Qxh1} Qxg6 {and i still can move Nb4 !} 8. Qf3 {before moving the knight, i prefer consolidate my king position and threat the center (d4) whith the rook} O-O-O {i'm still missing some developpement, this will become THE urgence for blacks} 9. O-O-O e6 {preparing development of bishop} 10. Nge2 {so i have some free time to develop, } Nf6 {this knight could be hepfull in order to throw out the white knight in c3, whith the help of the bishop f8. then a2 will be free (hopefully in some moves ...!)} 11. Nf4 {ouch, i did not expect a queen attack ! i hope white didnt make a plan because I have not planned any output secour... } Qf5 {in this way i hope i will reach the other side to attack the white king roque } 12. h3 {this is realy not very strong... it inform me that white have no plan (g4 looks realy poor, i dont considere it as a plan) this is a chance for me, i must take this opportunity} Qa5 {so here i am !!!} 13. Kb1 {white just defend, that's good for me i can prepare Qb6 ...Ba3, but he is a good player so he will refut it, i have to find something more appropriate} Bb4 {this is interesting it think, because it move the bishop in the attack area and threat to break the white castle (14. ... - Bxc3 15.b2xc3)} 14. Bd2 {anyway i have to kill this embarrassing knight, then i'll move the queen in b6 to threat the paw d4} Bxc3 15. Bxc3 Qb6 {the idea was to move the f6 knight in d5 to provoc the exchange whith the white knight in f4, then take back whith the d8 rook in order to place it n the attack area (b5),  BUT : white move his rook in d3, and that give me some other idea ...} 16. Rd3 Nb4 {i whould like to get rid of this c3 bishop whitch is defending b2} 17. Re3 {better for me ! } Nfd5 {isnt it strong !!!} 18. Nxd5 {no way, white has to exchange} Nxd5 {and here i am, liberated from the c3 bishop} 19. Rd3 Nxc3+ 20. Rxc3 {the white position is still strong but i win the center and a paw ! preparing the alignment of my rooks in d8-d1 } Rxd4 21. Qxf7 {paw back for white, it doesnt matter this f7 paw have not the same value than the d4 white paw i have eaten ! so now i 'm going to threat a mat :  21. Qxf7 Rhd8 22. ...Rd4d1+ 23.h1xd1 - d8xd1++ !!!!!!!} Rhd8 {isnt it good this one ???!!! (of course i'm very proud, you should understand that i'm just a little poor 1206 elo's player against a 1935 elo's master !)} 22. Rc1 {defending as a last ressort then the c1 white rok will stand there uselessly i have 2 towers and 1 queen actives pieces playing against just 1 tower and 1 queen active white pieces playing.  I MUST FIND THE MATE ! } Rd4d7 {first i have to defend the threat in c7 ...} 23. Qf4 Rd7d4 24. Qe5 {it whould be great to take the paw in f2 whith my queen, in this way i could play d4 d1 ...d1xc1 ...b1xc1 and Qf1++ ! but will i have the opportunity and the time to do all this ? i think that my strong challenger won't give me all this time, so i have to find a forced mate...} Rd4d5 25. Qxg7 {ouch, wasnt good this black move !} Rd5d7 {i hope he wont go back in the f colon ...} 26. Qf6 {deception ...} a5 {a7 a5 !! this is good ! i prepare a paw attack to the white castle, of course, this is the first level of understanding ...but i prepare also to put my queen in a3 to be abble to go in f1 ! (just in case of ...)} 27. Re3 Rd7d6 {defending my e3 paw} 28. a3 {white are still in the first understanding level of my a5 last move ...} Qa6 {this is it !! but there is still a problem :  if i play rd1, white will cancel the threat whith qxe6+, then i have to exchange the queens and there is no more mate, or i put the d8 rook between (d6) and it can become a draw (white qf8, Rd6 d8 ...etc) BUT THIS TIME I WAS LUCKY ! white make a mistake moving Rc1 e1...} 29. Rce1 Rd6d1+ {now i have my forced mate coming ! i feel so HAPPY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!} 30. Ka2 Qc4+ {following  31. b3 - Qc2++  or Rb3 - Rd1xe1 ...and black paw a5  a4 ...etc  So white master resing ! This is wy i like blitz. People says that is not sirious game. I dont agree, it is VERY serious because in the life most of the time you dont have a lot of weeks to take your decisions ...isnt it ? so i will improve this interesting scandinavian defense against e4. }
