1. e4 d5 {I played rarely this opening.} 2. f3 {I am happy about moves like this. It weakens the kingside and gives the black squares to me.} dxe4 3. fxe4 a6 {Just for security.} 4. d3 Nc6 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. h3 b5 7. Be2 Nd4 8. Be3 c5 {I won territory.} 9. Bxd4 cxd4 10. Nb1 Bb7 11. Bf3 Qc7 12. Ne2 e5 {Maybe this isnot good for me. e6 would be enough for free my bishop but not to closing my queen. I loose here some tempo.} 13. g4 g6 14. g5 Nd7 15. h4 h6 16. Bg4 hxg5 {To win a pawn.} 17. h5 {To make better the pawnstructure.} gxh5 18. Rxh5 Rxh5 {Whites pieces are inactive, so I change the active pieces.} 19. Bxh5 Nc5 20. c3 Qd6 21. Ng3 Bc8 22. Qf3 Be6 23. Nf5 Bxf5 24. Qxf5 Qe6 25. Qf3 Be7 26. b4 Nd7 {I was hoping in my g5 pawn after the queens' exchange and a 0-0-0.}
