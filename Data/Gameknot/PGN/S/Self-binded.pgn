1. d4 b6 2. Bf4 Bb7 3. Nd2 g6 4. e4 Nf6 5. e5 {I tried this instead, for variety's sake. } Nd5 6. Bg3 {The N can be kicked and the tmpo returned. With some precautions. } c6 {??? Anti-natural move that cramps inmediately black beyond the imaginable. } 7. a3 {This is to prevent Nd5 to jump on b4 after c4. } e6 8. c4 Nc7 {Now tell me: who has the board?} 9. Ne4 {Nf6 is a must. Only move: Be7, covering al N's landing squares. } Qc8 {?} 10. Nf6+ Kd8 11. Bh4 {Maybe not the best. Better is to develop some other piece, but I couldn't see any attack right now. } g5 {? Another help from my opponent, who obviously doesn't know what to play!} 12. Bxg5 h6 13. Bh4 Be7 14. Qh5 Nba6 15. Nf3 {Qxf7 at once was just an invitation to Rf8. But now, this N has a target. } c5 16. Be2 {?? Losing the track. Ng5 at once would have won right away. } cxd4 17. Ng5 Ne8 18. Nxf7+ Kc7 {Cashing the R would have been easy, but...} 19. Nxe8+ Rxe8 20. Bxe7 Rxe7 21. Nd6 {This appealed me more, but I was just losing a possible 5 points free win. } Qg8 {aiming to g2.} 22. Nxb7 {If Qxg2, Bf3. } Kxb7 23. Bf3+ Kb8 24. Bxa8 Kxa8 25. Qf3+ Kb8 {...and I am +3, with an exchange and a won engdame. } 26. b4 Qg5 27. Qe4 {}
