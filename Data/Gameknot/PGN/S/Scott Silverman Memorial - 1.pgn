[Opening "Benoni defence (A61)"]

1. d4 {Lesson:  Don't be intimidated by higher rated opponents.  Chess is an objective game.  Round 2 of a 4 round tournament in Skokie, IL (two rounds per day).  This was preparation for my run in the U1700 of the Chicago Open, 2012. Probably one of my worst tournaments ever.} Nf6 {I used to play the Tartakower QGD lines after 1...d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 with the idea of castling short and playing h6, Nbd7 b6 and c5 at some moment to strike at the center.  I am now looking at the theory of the benoni and the nimzo indian defense.} 2. c4 c5 {The invitation for the modern benoni.} 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 {The essential pawn structure of the modern benoni.  I know a bunch of theory in the central set up systems for white with Nf3 h3 e4 and Bd3, where black gets the theoretical trick of ...b5! to complicate matters and hope for dynanmic counterchances.  I also don't mind the fianchetto systems.} 6. g3 g6 7. Bg2 Bg7 8. Nf3 O-O 9. O-O Re8 10. Bf4 Nh5 {Perhaps a little early but the idea is simple: Bf4 hits the weak d6 point in black's camp and with the f3 knight coming to c4 to intensify the pressure, black must sooner or later push away the threats to get play on the QS} 11. Be3 Qe7 {I looked at Qc7 as well but Nb5 looked annoying} 12. Nd2 {The thematic knight maneauver} a6 13. a4 Nd7 {In time to meet Nc4 with Ne5 and the dance of the knight's will commence} 14. Nc4 Ne5 15. Nb6 Rb8 16. h3 {I think this is an inaccuracy and with any good play by me I should have held this game at equality soon.  In some lines h3 is a good idea to keep the bishop or knight (though the knight is on h5 now, not f6) from hopping into g4.  However, here I think for an advantage a5 was needed to clamp down on the black queenside} Nd7 17. Nc4 b5 {Fine play.  Also good was Ne5 looking for repetition where white has few better options than to either trade knights or accept the repetition.  Black's tactic of Nxg3 is in the air, although I never had time to execute it.} 18. axb5 axb5 19. Na5 Bb7 {A panic move. The engine recommends Qf8 to reserve the threat of Nxg3.  Black should be fine because of dynamics here, although it looks scary.  Giving the exchange is better than allowing the d pawn to becoming a c6 passer. } 20. Nc6 Bxc6 21. dxc6 Ne5 {? Nb6 was needed to keep the white knight out of the d5 whole, when black is holding on just fine} 22. Nd5 Qf8 23. c7 Rbc8 24. Ra7 Re7 25. Nxe7+ Qxe7 {And I resigned perhaps prematurely, thinking that somehow (foolishly) Bb7 traps the white rook.  Rather it looks like black is worse for sure, being down the exchange, but he looks forward to a QS majority as compensation and he should win back the c pawn of white.  I think maybe there are some practical saving chances left, though the computer disagrees.}
