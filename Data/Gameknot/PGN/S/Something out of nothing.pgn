1. e4 {The title of this annotation is because this is probably one of my best displays of technique where from a position that doesn't appear to be more than slightly better for white gradually almost imperceptibly turns decisive. Of course this is largely due to taking advantage of blacks mistakes but never the less I made no major error in converting the point.} e6 {The French defence } 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 {I've become a fan of this, the Tarrasch variation. White chooses to develop the knight here as opposed to its 'classical' square so that d4 can be thoroughly reinforced by c3 and potentially Ndf3 and Nge2, and of course if black plays ...c5 immediately then the idea is to straddle black with an isolated queens pawn then play against that} c5 4. exd5 Qxd5 {This is adopted so that black is not left with an isolated d pawn which gives white a clear target and plan. Of course this move has the disadvantages that white will gain a bit of time attacking the black queen and the black pawn on e6 will mean that black will have to develop the LSB via ...b6 and Ba6/b7} 5. Ngf3 cxd4 6. Bc4 Qd7 {!? A relatively new move that appeared not all that long ago in New in chess with some analysis. The point is that this allows for the DSB to develop freely and neither the black knight or the black LSB will need to make use of d7 so the queen is not blocking anything from this square. Though if I were in blacks position I think I would prefer to place the queen back on her home square since it seems, to me at least that the dark squares will be of more consequence} 7. O-O Nc6 8. Nb3 {The black pawn will eventually fall} Nf6 9. Nbxd4 Bc5 10. Nxc6 Qxc6 11. Ne5 Qb6 {By chasing the black queen on to b6 I'm making it harder for black to complete development, the LSB in particular will be a couple of moves before it gets to see any action, and if the LSB can't move the a8 rook can't contribute either} 12. c3 O-O 13. Bd3 {It seems pretty apparent that whites play is mainly going to be on the kingside and the bishop was not doing anything on c4} Qc7 14. Bf4 {Allowing for possible discovered attacks with moves like Ng6 } Bd6 {Black sidesteps that whilst also placing pressure on my advanced knight} 15. Qe2 {This square is a flexible square for the queen where it ;protects the knight, can still come to c2 and can also form a battery via Bc2 and Qd3 and of course by using my queen instead of my rook I have connected my rooks meaning they can potentially sit on the central open and semi open files respectively } b6 16. Rfd1 {Possibly the the other rook should have been preferred since this would mean my bishop had the option of playing to b1 without disrupting communication of my rooks but I don't think there is too much difference between which rook I used, I also liked to retain the option of placing one of my rooks on the c file } Bb7 17. Bc2 {Preparing for a potential battery and also allowing my rook to participate in the struggle for central control} Rad8 18. Rd4 Bxe5 {?! Giving up the bishop pair in an open position like this for no apparent compensation doesn't seem like a wise choice. However looking back at the position I notice that whites logical play so far has left white In a position where the pieces are controlling more space and the knight standing proudly on e5 leaves a nice impression, he was also preventing black from doubling rooks, and because of all this it is quite hard to suggest a good plan for black, so I guess it's understandable that black wanted to initiate  some exchanges leaving black with a less cramped slightly more manageable position} 19. Bxe5 Qc6 20. f3 {Black does not have a DSB anymore, so it is unlikely that he will be able to take advantage of the opened up diagonal to my king, so this move blunts the black battery and gives my king quicker access to the centre when the endgame rolls around. It may also be an alternate route for my queen to get to the kingside at some point } Rxd4 21. Bxd4 Rd8 {So now after a couple of exchanges we can see whites bishops doing a marvellous job directed ominously at the black monarch. White retains a very small but slightly annoying edge} 22. Rd1 {Contesting the only open file} Kf8 {? Black starts creeping his king closer to the centre of the board however the queens are still on the board and as such this is not yet an endgame. This could lose a pawn to 23.Bxf6 followed by Bxh7 however I decide to go down a different path. But then it is hard to suggest an alternative plan for black, clearly black should try to exchange one of whites bishops, but there are no obvious ways to do that further more blacks minor pieces can't seem to find any useful roles since the f3 pawn both blunts blacks bishop and takes away squares from the knight} 23. Qe5 {As said in the previous diagram, I could have won a pawn here however I felt this was a better approach. After 23.Bxf6 gxf6 24.Bxh7 f5 white has given up the bishop pair and turned the remaining bishop into an inactive piece that may even find itself trapped, in short I felt black got far more play for the pawn than was necessary to be allowed  } Ke7 24. Qg3 {This leaves white with a very large advantage however it turns out that Qg5 should have been deceive. I fact I'm not sure why I played this move instead especially since It involves moving my queen backward diagonally to a square she is a little less active } Ne8 25. Bxh7 {Now that black gets nothing for it I decide to snatch the pawn} Qb5 26. Rd2 f6 27. Bd3 {Bg6 was my first thought looking to remove the knight which is the glue holding blacks position together however I decided to first throw in a zwishenzug to get the to a slightly less active square } Qa5 28. Bg6 Nd6 29. a4 {Once again my first thought was to move my bishop so as to start attacking blacks position, however I decided to throw in another zwishenzug. This move gains queenside space and also takes away a few squares from the black queen. I can also follow up with b4 where the queen is basically out of useful squares since g5 would be the only safe square however that allows white to further break down blacks position liquidating into an easily winning endgame} Qxa4 {?? This surprised me that black would make this sudden blunder now he must give up the queen in order to avoid mate, the point is that white now gets to move the bishop with tempo} 30. Bc2 Qe8 31. Qxg7+ Qf7 32. Bxf6+ {Anyway hope you enjoyed probably one of my most well executed methodical wins to date, if you don't mind a always enjoy a couple of comments.}
