[Opening "KP (B00), Nimzovich defence, Marshall gambit"]

1. e4 Nc6 {Warning: this gme times out right when it's getting good. It's a team match and I am playing black. White opens with the Open Game and I reply with the Nimzovich Defense.} 2. d4 d5 {Scandanavian Variation.} 3. e5 f6 {Main Line.} 4. f4 e6 {My reference suggests 4. Nf3 and has no coverage of 4. f4.} 5. Nf3 fxe5 6. fxe5 Be7 {Really just winging it. I think I played this one since the GameKnot DB recommended it. I was eager to castle kingside and get my rook on the open f-file or, if white beats me to it, just put my rook on f8 and oppose white's claim of the open file. 6. ... Bb4  just seems to fail after 7. c3 and then white chases my bishop back to b6 (or a7 with an extra move or two), or back to e7, so I just played to e7 to begin with. In retrospect, since f6 is covered by white's pawn at e5, I might have wanted to play my king's knight here first.} 7. Bb5 Bd7 {Breaking the pin.} 8. a4 Bh4+ {Thinking (incorrectly) that I would clear e7 for my knight.} 9. g3 Be7 {In my head I had seen 9. ... Bg4 but when it came time to actually play it, I quickly realized that would cost me a piece, so back to e7 I go. I'm starting to feel cramped and miserable and it's looking like white's having all the fun.} 10. h4 h6 11. Nc3 Bb4 {Aha! Now 11. ... Bb4 gets me off of e7.} 12. O-O Nge7 {Finally!} 13. Qd3 a6 {Forces the trade since white's queen blocks any retreat for the bishop.} 14. Bxc6 Bxc6 {Ahh, a bit of breathing room. I'm thinking Qd7, 0-0-0, and bringing a rook to f8 comes next, but this is when the timeout happened, again just when it was getting good. 39 days for 14 moves - this game could have gone on for months...}
