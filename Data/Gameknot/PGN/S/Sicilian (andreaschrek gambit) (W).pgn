1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Andreashreck gambit.} cxd4 3. Nf3 d6 {Black doesn't try to defend the d pawn.} 4. Nxd4 {So that white takes} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 {Developing on the center} Qc7 7. Qd3 {Now white can castle long but 7. Qd3 is a mistake - 7. Qd2 would have been much better (see move 10.)} e6 {Black plays rather prudently} 8. f3 {Reinforcing the center and preventing Ng4} Be7 9. O-O-O {Long castle. some risk because the black queen is in front of the white king but white controls te center.} Nc6 10. Qd2 {If 10. ... Nb4, fork attack between a pawn and queen. White has to move his queen twice and loses one move. With both players catling on the opposite side, one move can cost one game.} O-O 11. g4 {Now I considered white's developpement as finished. For I want to keep the LSB on his square as long as possible because it could be usefull on e2 or d3 and I have no moves to lose, for both players have castled on the opposite side. The rush at the Kings will soon begin. Will black defend or will he try to attack the white king and if so he does, who will be the quickest ? (I analysed the game as deep as I could and was not sure at all).} b5 {Quicly developping toward the white king.} 12. Nxc6 {To prevent white's attack by Nb4. I spend one move but it should make my opponent lose at least two moves to be really dangerous for the king.} Qxc6 13. b3 {This move makes me lose one more tempo but I thought black would lose more time.} Bb7 {enabling 14. ... Rc8} 14. g5 {Now, white considers the king sufficiently safe to be able to attack.} Nd7 {Black could have plaid 14. ... Nh5 but this would have trapped it with 15. f4 ... and 16. Be2} 15. h4 {White attacking plan is very simple (pawns supported by DSB, Q, R and, if necessary LSB). In this position I think that white is better because his piecs on the center can be used wether to attack or to defend, which i not the case for black.} Rac8 {Menacing the knight on c3} 16. Ne2 {Retreating. A good spot because it controls c3 and d4 which will be an important square. Drawback : it blocks the LSB.} Qc7 {To avoid 17. Nd4 but giving white one tempo. At this moment, I saw a tactic.} 17. Nf4 {To menace e6 (and fork attack between Q and R). Black would need his f7 pawn to take the knight and (playing fxe6) and couldn't play fxg6.} Ne5 {Attacking white's weak f pawn.} 18. Be2 {To protect the f pawn and join the two rooks.} Nc6 {Black sends one more piece on his right wing. It reinforces his attacking possibilities but weakens his kingside.} 19. Kb1 {To protect a2} b4 {Now black's on attack but it'll take time before it gets dangerous.} 20. h5 {If 20. ...Bxg5 21. Nxe6 fxe6 22. Bxg5 : white wins one pawn and the black king is considerably weakened.} a5 {Black still needs a few moves before getting dangerous. whites attacking pawns on g and h are nearer.} 21. g6 {It's time to launch the attack.} hxg6 {Black has no choice (if 21. ... fxg6 22. Nxe6 and black loses his f rook.)} 22. hxg6 {Now black is in trouble.} a4 {Black opts for an attacking move but he needs atleast two toher moves before getting really dangerous.} 23. gxf7+ {I considered that 23. Rh3 .. 24. Rdh1 ... 25. Rh8 mate would take to much time for black's attack will quickly get dangerous.} Kxf7 {Forced move.} 24. Nxe6 {Fork attack (Q and f rook). Black has to take.} Kxe6 {Now white is in late in material but the black king is fairly unsafe.} 25. Bc4+ {Attacking the black king and preventing a further Qxc2+, thus enabling the white queen to leave her guarding post and attack.} Kd7 {Almost forced move.} 26. Qd5 {At this point, I tried to analyse all of black possibilities and had the impression that the game was won for white but it's a complex situation and I was not quite sure (I could handle 26. ... Qa5 by 27. Qe6+ ... 28. Rd5 ; 26. ... Rxf3 27. Qe6+ Kd8 or Ke8 28. Rh8 with a mate to come ; 26. ... axb3 27. Bxb3 with situation almost unchanged but safer white king. I had some doubts with 26. ... Na5. But at least I could obtain a draw.) However... } Ne5 {Blunder. Black choses one of the worst moves he had.} 27. Qxe5 {Black submited here.}
