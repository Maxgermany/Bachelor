1. d4 {Continuing with the Queen's pawn opening. I have recently been favoring this and the English opening over the kings pawn.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 {Black looks to fienchet his bishop and castle king side.} 3. Nc3 {I'm starting to like this opening. I find it is giving me more options with the c pawn already advanced the Knight development can't cramp the c pawn.} Bg7 {Black continues his line of development.} 4. e4 {Now I have a good control of the centre and c4 is protected.} d6 5. Nf3 {Both knights out.} O-O {I thought Joe might have gone Bg4 here.} 6. Be2 {Ready to castle and protecting my knight.} c5 {Joe comes to life attacking my centre.} 7. O-O {I choose to castle instead of dxc5 or d5.} cxd4 8. Nxd4 {pawn exchange. My centre not so strong with that d pawn gone.} Nc6 {Attacking my Knight knowing that any movement from his other Knight would reveal a double attack on my Knight.} 9. Be3 {So I decide to defend the Knight by developing another piece.} Bd7 {I thought about moving a knight to b5 but decided against it as a6 would easily chase the knight back.} 10. Qd2 a6 {Stopping the advance of my knights to b5.} 11. f3 {protecting e4 so my knight on c3 can move to d5.} e6 {Black sees that and protects d5.} 12. a3 {Stopping an advance from blacks Knight and preparing an advance of my b pawn.} Qc7 {Black protects d6.} 13. b4 Rac8 {c4 looks weak now.Next move for black would be Ne5 attacking c4 wit Queen,Rook and Knight.} 14. f4 {So I defend e5.} e5 {Trying to force me to move fxe5 but that would only result in Joe getting his Knight to where he wants it attacking c4.} 15. Nxc6 {So I dispose of the Knight with an exchange.} Bxc6 {e4 is now being attacked by 2 pieces.} 16. Bf3 {So I defend e4 but that leaves c4 hanging.} Bd7 {Joe immediately attacks c4 with a discovered attack.} 17. Rac1 {Protecting c4 through the knight. If black takes c4 then I move my knight to d5 attacking his knight and e7. At the same time my Rook would be attacking his Queen.} Qb8 {So black moves his Queen out of the way still protecting d6.} 18. c5 {attacking d6 and protecting the pawn I have moved.} Ng4 {Black attacks my black bishop hoping to take a defender away from c5.  At the same time opening up his a1-h8 line for his bishop if he moves exf4 in the near future.} 19. Bxg4 {I decide on the exchange.} Bxg4 20. h3 {Then to drive the bishop back whence it came.} Bd7 {I thought he may have moved ot back to e6 instead stopping any advance of my knight.} 21. f5 {My plan was to eventually get my Knight to e7. Not yet though. I decide to block off whites bishop and open mine for an attack down the c1-h6 line.} Rfd8 {Black wants to give his bishop protection so he can take my c pawn next move .} 22. Bg5 {attacking his rook to try and get him to shift it.} Rde8 {I don't really want that rook there. With the eventual plan of advancing my knight. I thought he may have blocked the bishop attack here with f6 instead making me move my bishop .} 23. cxd6 {The d pawn falls at last.} Rc6 {Black immediatly attacks the pawn.} 24. Rfd1 {So I defend the pawn.} f6 {Black makes that f6 move attacking my bishop. Was that wise though? By doing that he has opened up the a2-g8 line where his King stands.} 25. Bh6 {I look for an exchange of bishops which would leave my Queen on h6 and looking to break blacks pawns in front of his King. I also looked at Qa2+ and Qd5+ as well.} Rd8 {Black is being stubborn and is concentrating all his efforts on d6.} 26. Be3 {26.Bxg7, Kxg7, that exchange would not achieve much for me and black would then have the a7-g1 line to attack down. So I decide to re station my bishop at c5 giving d6 extra protection and keeping the a7-g1 line blocked. My d pawn is keeping black cramped so I really need to keep it there as long as possible.} Bf8 {Black attacks d6.} 27. Bc5 {I move where I had planned giving it some protection. Half knowing that Joe would move b6 trying to make me retreat the Bishop.} b6 {Yep He did it. Now decisions have to be made. If I move my Bishop away then d6 falls probably to the rook attacking my Queen. What to do? } 28. Nd5 {I decide to leave the bishop where it is  and look to get my knight to e7. However making this move would block off my Queen from protecting d6.} bxc5 {I lose a Bishop but my Knight can now atack!  Ne7+ or Nxf6+. I think Ne7+ is better.  It checks the King while forking his Rook. If 28. Ne7+,Bxe7. 29. dxe7...  attacking his rook on d8 and if Joe moves it then I get my Bishop back with Qxd7.} 29. Ne7+ {I go for Ne7+.} Kf7 {Maybe Kh8 or Kg7 better. Instead Black decides to attack the Knight. Blacks King is still on that a2-g8 line!} 30. Qd5+ {So I decide instead of Nxc6, that can come next, I bring my Queen forward to check and give my Knight some protection when I take the rook.} Ke8 {My eye's light up!! The King has just put on a coat with massive shoulder pads on. Black's King is now trapped between his own pieces! Kg7 would have been better providing an escape through his pawns if 30...Kg7. 31.Qg8+, Kh6.} 31. Nxc6 {Now Black's Queen and other Rook are forked. To avoid checkmate Joe must let the other rook fall to the white Knight and save his Queen as Black can't move his bishop away from protecting e6. } Bxc6 {Black allows me in. Qxc6 would not achieve much. } 32. Qe6+ {In for the kill! Joe realises he is doomed and resigns. 32.Qe6+, Be7. 33.Qxe7#. Black's shoulder pads are far to big for him to move about in. }
