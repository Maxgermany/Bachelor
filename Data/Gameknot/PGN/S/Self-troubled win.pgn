1. d4 d6 2. Bf4 b6 3. Nd2 Nc6 {Bad move? I don't like the light squares weakness, but I guess Bb7 will come shortly anyway. I should have tried g3, Nxd4, Bg2. Nothing special, or do I miss something?} 4. c3 {Playing off mainline, as I like. } g6 {Not necessarily bad, but what's the plan? He's just showing his cards, and then helping me to make my plan.} 5. e4 Nf6 6. Qf3 {This is inviting Bg4, Qd3, and my action on black's queenside white squares seems more dangerous than black's B on g4, aiming at nothing. True or false?} Bb7 {The expected one. Now I have it easy, d5, if I don't mind to lose my dsb... which I don't want. } 7. Bb5 {The plan was the following: } a6 8. Bxc6+ Bxc6 9. d5 {...and black's lsb is very unconfortable on d7.} Bd7 10. h3 {Squeezing black in, and providing an escape route for my dsb. } Bg7 {What else? Black should have acted quickly on the Q side to counterbalance my increasing pressure, with c6!} 11. Ne2 {...to d4, controlling c6. } Nh5 12. Be3 {I was very doubtful about this move. Bh2 seemed natural. But what if black wakes up on the Q side, and I find my lsb useless in h2, byting granite on d6, while my diagonal is undefended? So I preferred to place it here, so to support d4 and trheaten either to exchange black's lsb for the N or to force e5 (dxe6ep!?)... a classic and juicy situation, with some interest. Stronger players will see the weaknesses better than me...} e5 13. g4 {Finally, I thought that my attack on the Kside was able to keep him too busy to break on c6. The main reason I didn't take en passant was that after dxe6ep, Bxe6 was just ok for black, and even o-o-o, placing the R on d1, was not really such a great advantage. Was it accurate?} Nf6 14. O-O-O {Well: if c6 now, dxc6, Bxc6 could be interesting for something like Nc4 (attacking d6), but black has Bxe4 in return. So this was not really accurate. More important was Ng3 (g4, and Nf3 can't go to h5 or NxN, opening the lines). } Ba4 {b3 is always there, but what happens if I use the R into the K side, instead, making his move a plain loss of time?} 15. Rdf1 {Here, because I sensed that my plan had to include f4, even opening the diagonal for him. So the R will be useful there. Against Bb5, c4. } c5 {Now, I have to be coherent. If dxc6, I just help him, and without the R in d1 it is just a step worse than before. I have to go on with my plan. Will white get to attack faster than black? Let's see: if g5, Nh4. I have to play the Ng3 first. But I didn't see that plan: I saw a worse one. } 16. Qg3 {f4, of course, and hope he doesn't manage to exchange pawns on the Qside. "Hope chess", as we know... well, it was not exactly "hope"... let's call it "intuition". The think that so often fails at chess. The thing I missed was that...} Bb5 {...Ne2, not forseen to be moved, is hanging, and if I defend with...} 17. c4 Bd7 {Returning to a more active place, as before, and preventing h4. Now he has a break point with b5, but I have...} 18. f4 exf4 {I know my b2 pawn is now weak because of c4 (it was the downside, of course) but black is far from being able to get his Q over there... is it?} 19. Bxf4 {Eyeing d6, of course. Was it correct?} O-O 20. Bxd6 Re8 21. e5 {Too-nice-not-to-play-it. } Nxd5 {Not only I won a N for a pawn: his pawns are now far from mine, and they are my best defence, in a way. Was it true?} 22. cxd5 Bb5 {Ups. Ok...} 23. Qf3 {Not really caring about BxN, even if Qxf7 doesn't return the piece forcedly. Was it correct? After BxN, would you have played BxB or Qxf7+?} Qd7 {Defending. Now the threat on e5 is active, and e6, fxe6 is not of any help. And I still can't move my Ne2, pinned to the R. About the other one, its obvious destination is f6, but how to make BxN bad for him? And I missed that he has Bh3 (other than Bxe6), pinning my N...} 24. Rf2 {Going out of the pin, keeping the pressure on f7, but conceding e5. } Rac8 {A pity: black tries this instead, which is too slow.} 25. Rhf1 {I can't believe it: I got again in the same pin I just got out of. Just to press on f7, while still losing e5...} Bxe5 26. Bxe5 Rxe5 27. Ne4 {Now black can't take on d5... } Qe7 {d6 comes to mind. But then, Qe8... I sense I missed the best move somewhere around here. } 28. Nf6+ Kg7 {Now what? Me stupid... and I'm still losing Ne2 or Rf1. Now d6, Qxd6 was to be played first, but I missed it. The plan is not Ne8+, RxN, Qxf7+, Kh1 and white is not winning.} 29. Nh5+ {Just an emergency escape route I saw in a second... probably, a losing move. } gxh5 30. Qxf7+ Qxf7 31. Rf2xf7+ Kg8 {Of course, this mean to lose an exchange...} 32. Rf1f6 {So better to keep on attacking with my last soldier, while the c column is still closed. } Bxe2 33. d6 Bc4 {Now, this is a nice moment. Now I did see the combination and played it instantly. Was there a better one?} 34. d7 Ra8 35. Rf7f8+ Rxf8 36. Rxf8+ Kxf8 37. d8=Q+ Kf7 38. Qc7+ Re7 39. Qf4+ {...and there is no hope for black. Thank you for reading and please correct me if you want!} Ke8 40. Qxc4 b5 41. Qxc5 {}
