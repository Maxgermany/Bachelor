1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Nd5 Be7 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 11. c3 {So this is the beginning position of the Chelyabinsk Variation of the Sicilian defense or the modern treatment of the Pelikan Variation. This is also widely known as the Sveshnikov Variation. By not exchanging the Knight f6 on the 9th move, White has entered the so-called "positional line". It means generally less risk, and a more logical game ahead. By conceding the Bishop pair and a certain amount of counter-play on the king-side, White is hoping to make his white square domination tell in the center and on the queen-side.} Bg5 12. Nc2 O-O 13. a4 {The idea of this move is by exchanging a pawn to create an isolated pawn for Black on the queen-side.} Rb8 {The other side of the coin is to take on a4, instead of moving the rook. It is surely better, because here, white is enjoying the open a-file.} 14. axb5 axb5 15. Bd3 f5 {Activating the f-file but objectively playing into White hands, as the exchange of white-squared bishops is desirable.} 16. exf5 Bxf5 17. Bxf5 Rxf5 18. O-O {Unless Black manages to create some nice threats on the king-side, White will enjoy good positional advantage due to the white squares weaknesses c6-d5-e6 and b5 and d6 weak pawns.} g6 {Somewhat passive and loses the d6 pawn or worse, better was to push the e pawn to create some dynamics in the position : 18...e4 19.Nce3 Re5} 19. Ra6 {Winning a pawn or more with tricks if Black wants to maintain Nc6. For instance 19...Qd7 20.Ndb4 Rc8? 21.Rxc6 Rxc6 22.Qd5   winning.} Ne7 20. Nde3 {20.Ncb4 instead was winning the d6 pawn. The move played wants more in trying to force Black pieces into bad positions.} Rf6 21. Ng4 Re6 22. Re1 Rb6 {Not seing the trap initiated with the last move. If 22...Nf5 to stop the threat of Nd4, then 23.Qd5 Qe7 24.Nxe5 crashes through.} 23. Rxb6 Qxb6 24. Nd4 {Black's rook is lost, with no counter-play and logically resigns.}
