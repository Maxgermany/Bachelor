1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {The first time I try this variation} Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 {Black doesn't trade the knight.} 5. Nc3 g6 {preparing the fiancheto} 6. Nxc6 {So that black cannot attack the d knight with bishop and c knight} bxc6 7. e5 {Strong but dangerous move. The pawn will be hard to defend.} Nh5 {The black knight is on the side, bad place but the white e pawn is a bit lonesome} 8. Be2 {Black can hardly castle long because of the pawn structure. White's plan is to do the same on the other wing to prevent black to castle efficiently} Ng7 {Black chooses to retreat. I prefer that my opponent has a knight rather than a bishop on the g7 square.} 9. Be3 {As black's pawn structure is weak on the queenside, white plans to castle long.} Nf5 {Not a very efficient move, for it permits white to carry on developing and the knight will be forced to drawback if white plays g4} 10. Qd3 {To enable the long castle} Nxe3 11. Qxe3 {Now white has two pawns out against one pawn and 3 pieces for white who is far stronger in the center.} Bg7 12. O-O-O h5 {? Black should have castle. This move weakens black's king if he castle and it achieves little as white has castled long.} 13. f4 {Developing and setting pressure on the center} Qc7 {Black probably planned to push the f or the d pawn (rather f than d, I imagine) but it's not an immediate threat for white.} 14. h3 {To prepare g4} Qb7 {Black looses one more move in developpement for a menace which is not immediate.} 15. g4 {Black keeps on advancing on the king side.} Rb8 16. b3 {Black's menace on the b file is no more efficient.} e6 {This move was almost anavoidable but if white manages to bring a knight on d6 or f6, it will be bad for black.} 17. gxh5 {Opening a file on the king side. Now black cannot castle} gxh5 18. Rhg1 {Using the open file to attack the king side} Qb4 {Unefficient move.} 19. Ne4 Qa3+ 20. Kb1 {Black's menace on the kingside is no more efficient.} d5 {attacking on the center} 21. Nd6+ {black probably hoped 21. exd6 Qb2 + mate} Ke7 {Now, material is equal but white's position is very strong.} 22. Rxg7 {Launching the attack} Rf8 23. Bxh5 {Aiming at the f7 square} Bd7 {To join both rooks but it comes to late.} 24. Bxf7 {The mating sequence begins} Rxf7 25. Rxf7+ Kd8 {forced move} 26. Rf8+ Kc7 27. Rxb8 {With black's material advance, a trade cannot be bad.} Kxb8 28. Rg1 {The open file is a highway to bring the reinforcements} a5 {Blunder} 29. Qb6+ Ka8 {forced move} 30. Qb7# {}
