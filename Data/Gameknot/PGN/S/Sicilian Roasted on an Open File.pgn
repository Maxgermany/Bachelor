1. e4 {Standard King's Pawn opening.} c5 {Sicilian it is.  Good thing I'm Italian.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3 Qa5+ {For some reason this chess program on my Nook e-reader loves to bring his Queen out early...} 6. Bd2 Qc5 7. Bc3 {Bc3 defends the Knight on d4 a second time, since Black is attacking it twice.} d5 {Black makes a push to break open the center.  I want to develop before it bursts, since his King is a sitting duck if the center goes and he isn't castled.} 8. Nd2 Nxd4 9. Nc4 Nxc2+ {I saw this coming.  I want to castle queenside for a big attack on the soon to be open d-file so I let it happen.} 10. Qxc2 dxc4 {He wins the Knight back, but at what price?} 11. O-O-O e5 12. Qd2 {A very strong threat materializes for his stranded King.} Bd7 {Preparing to castle Queenside perhaps?} 13. g4 {! The Knight on f6 protects the d7 square.  Here is a push to remove him.  A simple ...h6 by Black could slow the attack.  But instead...} Ba4 {Threatening a key piece to my invasion.  No worries if I can connect the Rooks...} 14. Bxc4 {Another sacrifice to connect the Rooks and continue the attack.  Black can't castle through check, but he should activate his Bishop on f8 and allow for a Kingside castle.  Instead...} Bxd1 15. Rxd1 {And the threat is still alive.} Qxc4 16. g5 {Politely asking the Knight to take a hike.} Nh5 {And he obliges.  Better is...Qxa2 and after gxf6 then ...Qa1+ and Black has some counter play.
