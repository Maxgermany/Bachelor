1. d4 {My 4th 4NCL match of the season, and my 4th youngster to play! My opponent was aged 15.} Nf6 {Indian systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Defence} 2. c4 {My usual.} c5 {Selecting the Benoni. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoni_Defense} 3. d5 {I think this is the most principled move, aiming for a space advantage. } b5 {The Benko Gambit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit} 4. cxb5 {I take.} a6 {He offers another pawn. I have tried various things in this position. I have tried  5. Nc3 axb5 6. e4 b4 7. Nb5 and now black loses if the pawn on e4 is taken - 8. Qe2! wins for white. But if black keeps cool, there are no problems, and white doesn't have the extra pawn. So now I tried something else.} 5. e3 {I like taking the pawn, and have a piece firmly planted on b5, so black doesn't have the open a and b files for his rooks on a8 and b8 firing down at my a and b pawns.} Bb7 {Attacking d5.} 6. Nc3 {Protecting d5.} axb5 {he takes.} 7. Bxb5 {I take back.} Qa5 {and the queen comes out, threatening the d pawn.} 8. Bd2 {Unpinning the knight.} Qb6 {And the queen drops back. The d pawn is under attack again.} 9. e4 {This is a mistake, I hand back the pawn. I should have played Qb3 or Bc4.} Nxe4 {now if I take his knight, he takes my bishop.} 10. Nge2 {So I develop my final minor piece.} Nxc3 {I can't help thinking in this open position the bishops are better than knight and I think he should have taken off my bishop on d2.} 11. Nxc3 {I have to take back this way to keep my bishop protected.} g6 {Typical to fianchetto this bishop in Benoni and Benko systems.} 12. O-O {I develop.} Bg7 {So does he.} 13. Re1 {Attacking e7 and already I had the following piece sacrifice in mind.} O-O {He castles, I was happy.} 14. Rxe7 {I take. I was very pleased to find out afterwards that Fritz agreed that this was the best move for white.} Bxc3 {He is after my Bb5, but the cost in terms of weakened black squares is not worth it. Fritz agrees. Fritz actually likes 14....Bxd5 and if 15. NxBd5 then QxBb5. In this way black gets back the pawn he has just lost. Fritz considers 14....Na6 as second best move. The move I was looking at was 14....Bf6 and white can offer the exchange with 15. Qe2, with advantage to white. } 15. Bxc3 {I take back.} Qxb5 {He takes the bishop.} 16. Qd2 {Threatening Qh6 and mating on g7.} Nc6 {A stunning defence! Qh6 is now met with Nd4! and black is winning.} 17. dxc6 {But I can just take it.} Qxc6 {And now he is threatening mate on g2.} 18. f3 {So I stop that.} d5 {Another clever defence. } 19. Be5 {But now he has to do something about the impending Qh6.} f6 {This is forced - but does lose a pawn.} 20. Qh6 {Threatening mate of course.} Rf7 {The only defence.} 21. Rxf7 {So I take.} Kxf7 {He takes back.} 22. Qxh7+ {I take the pawn.} Ke6 {Madness! Why charge up the board with the king like this? After Kf8 there is still work to be done to convert the extra pawn to a victory.} 23. Bg3 {Now is it just lost.} d4 {Nothing is much better.} 24. Re1+ {Finally mobilising my last piece. Of course Kd5 is met with 25. Qf7! mating.} Kf5 {So he comes this way instead. } 25. Qh3+ {Now I am mating.} Kg5 {Forced.} 26. Qh4+ {another queen check.} Kf5 {Forced again. I had a choice of mates in 1. It seemed most appropriate to have the mate where my bishop assists, as it has played such a key role in the attack. Many thanks for reading!
