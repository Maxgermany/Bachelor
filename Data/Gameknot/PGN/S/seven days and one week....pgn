1. c4 {an interesting game, in which I tried to trap my opponents queen at the expense of a few pawns. The queen eventually escaped and left me in a poor position. Valuable lesson learnt!!} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {White has surprisingly not moved d or e pawn yet.} g6 {intending Kings Indian defence.} 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 e5 {cant think why I played this as it blocks path of Bishop if Kings Indian defence is played. Planning an attack on f3 pawn at this stage was a mistake.} 6. Ng5 h6 {Played this to find out what the intentions of Ng5 were.} 7. Nge4 Nbd7 8. Nxf6+ Nxf6 9. Qb3 {Attacking B7 pawn.} Rb8 {mistake! should have moved Queen to defend b7 pawn} 10. Qa4+ {a7 pawn now lost.} Bd7 11. Qxa7 b5 {planning to try to trap Queen by blocking light squared Bishop then playing Ra8. But should have played b6 rather than b5 as will become apparent later.} 12. cxb5 e4 13. a4 d5 {b7 still a safe square for white's Queen so a bit more manouvering required. Had I played 11.b6 I could have now played 13.Bc6 to leave Queen in big trouble after 14.Ra8} 14. d3 Bd6 15. dxe4 {3 pawns down and Queen trap not assured. Looks bad for me.} Ra8 16. Qb7 {only safe square but can make escape shortly with Nd5...} O-O {trying to bring other Rook into play.} 17. Nxd5 {this was the right move for white. Queen looks to be ok and 3 pawn advantage now could be match winning.} Nxd5 18. Qxd5 {Queen escapes and I'm now 4 pawns down. Should be game over.} Bxb5 19. Bxh6 Qa5+ {Bad move. had white played Qd2 I'd have lost some more material} 20. Bd2 {Qd2 better I feel.} Qa6 21. e5 Rfe8 {Thought I play this as last roll of the dice hoping for big mistake by white. If he takes d6 Bishop with e pawn I win, but if he takes with Queen I loose. Since I am about to loose anyway decided to take the gamble. In hindsigth I'd have been better battling on and trying to win a few pawns back.} 22. Qxd6 {Correct choice by white. Game over!!} Rac8 23. Qxa6 {hoped he wouldn't do this but I'd have done the same! } Bxa6 24. f4 f6 {attempting to win back a Bishop if white takes f6, but bit unlikely.} 25. Bc3 Re7 26. Rd1 {no point continuing. Lesson learnt - dont throw away pawns unless Queen trap is certain.}
