1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 O-O {If e5 here, white's centre is over-extended. Bobby Fischer won a famous game with black in that variation, so I transpose back into well-known territory.} 5. Be3 d6 6. f3 e5 7. Nge2 Nbd7 8. Qd2 a5 9. g4 exd4 10. Nxd4 a4 {9. g4 strikes me as a brave move against my opponent. I am not sure if I would do it again - it seems to losen up the king's side - what do you think dear reader?} 11. Be2 a3 12. b3 Nc5 13. O-O-O Re8 14. Bg5 c6 15. h4 Qa5 16. h5 Ne6 17. Be3 Nd7 18. hxg6 hxg6 19. Kc2 Ndc5 20. Nxe6 Nxe6 21. Na4 Qe5 22. Qxd6 {Why not? It seems the logical way to continue. At the moment my knight covers the important b2 and c3 squares.} Qf6 {But now Black is threatening to play RxNa4 and then the queen comes in to c3 and/or b2 and mates. I have to return the pawn.} 23. e5 Qxe5 24. Qxe5 Bxe5 25. Nb6 Rb8 26. c5 Bf4 27. Bxf4 Nxf4 28. Bc4 Be6 29. Nd7 Bxd7 30. Rxd7 Ne6 31. b4 {I was starting to like my position. my bishop is better than his knight, and I have the active rook on the 7th rank. There was still work to be done of course.} Kg7 32. f4 {Of course, if Nxf4 then Rxf7 and Rxf4} Nd8 33. Kd3 b6 34. f5 bxc5 35. bxc5 Rb2 36. fxg6 Kxg6 37. Kd4 Kg5 38. Bxf7 {I am not sure why he didn't just take my bishop now, however....} Rf8 39. Bc4 Rd2+ 40. Bd3 Ne6+ 41. Kc3 Rff2 42. Rh8 Nxc5 {Nxc5 is the fatal error} 43. Rh5+ Kxg4 44. Rxc5 Rdxa2 45. Rg7+ Kh4 46. Rxc6 Kh5 47. Rc5+ Kh4 48. Rc8 {and black resigns}
