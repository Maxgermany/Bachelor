1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 c5 8. Ne2 O-O 9. O-O {This is a fairly standard - the Exchange Variation of the Gr√ºnfeld Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4 White's move order though is slightly strange - I played 9. 0-0 instead of 9. Be3 to avoid black exchanging pawns on d4 and then throwing in a queen check on a5. Black's next is an attempt to take advantage of this. } Qc7 {Although this move is the third most popular, according to the World Database on Gameknot, - after Nc6 and cxd4 - it also scores the best. Black now threatens to take on d4, discovering an attack on the Bc4.} 10. d5 { 10. Bf4 e5 11. Bxe5 Bxe5 12. dxe5 Qxe5 13. Bd5 seems to be the best way forward for white.} Nd7 {The obvious way to continue.} 11. f4 {Keeping the Nd7 out of e5. Bf4 or Rb1 has been played in this position previously. } Nb6 {So the knight comes out this way instead.} 12. Bb3 {Bishop drops back.} Bg4 {Threat - 13...Bg7xc3} 13. Bb2 {White protects.} Rad8 {Black develops} 14. h3 {White asks the question.} Bxe2 {He takes. I was rather expecting him to retreat of c8, but this seems adequate.} 15. Qxe2 {I take back.} c4 {He hits the bishop.} 16. Bc2 {It drops back.} Qc5+ {He throws in a check.} 17. Kh1 {Considering what happens later, maybe Kh2 was better.} Qa5 {he attacks c3.} 18. Qe3 {I protect. Now 18....Na4 is met with Ba3 with complications.} Rd7 {So now he is threatening Na4} 19. a4 {Which I prevent.} Rfd8 {He doubles on the d file.} 20. Ra3 {this was probably a mistake. By over-protecting c3, I release the Bb2 and/or the Qe3 for other duties.} e6 {He nibbles at my centre.} 21. dxe6 {I take.} fxe6 {He takes back.} 22. e5 {I shut out his bishop.} Rd7d2 {He advances} 23. Rf2 {I challenge} Rxf2 {He takes} 24. Qxf2 {I take back.} Bf8 {he attacks my rook.} 25. Ra1 {Rook drops back.} Bc5 {He attacks my queen.} 26. Qg3 {I threaten 27. Bxg6 with complications.} Kg7 {Which he avoids.} 27. f5 {So I play this.} exf5 {He takes} 28. Bxf5 {I take back.} Rf8 {He attacks} 29. Rf1 {I defend.} Qxa4 {He takes. he is now threatening Rxf5 and if I recapture, Qd1+ is winning for him.} 30. Kh2 {So I move my king.} Qc6 {Queen comes back to protect his king-side} 31. Bc1 {So my bishop heads towards the new war-zone.} Kh8 {By breaking the pin, black is now threatening to take on f5.} 32. Bh6 {But now if he takes, he gets mated.} Rf7 {I now lay a trap which he falls into.} 33. e6 {He sees the chance to take my queen.} Bd6 {He falls into the trap. 33.....Rf6 is correct and good.} 34. exf7 {I take his rook.} Bxg3+ {He takes my queen with check. } 35. Kxg3 {I take back.} Qc7+ {He has to play this to stop my pawn queening.} 36. Rf4 {I block.} Qxf7 {He takes. Right, white to play and win!} 37. Be4 {A blunder! 37. Bg4 was the only way to win.} Qc7 {Now the pin stops the mate on f8.} 38. Kf3 {Threatening mate again.} Nd7 {But now there is no mate.} 39. Rf7 {A final blunder in a lost position.} Ne5+ {Oops! White resigns.}
