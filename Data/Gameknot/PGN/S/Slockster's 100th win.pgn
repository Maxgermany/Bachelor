1. e4 {April this year must have been a sad day for all annotators, Slockster stopped annotating games and gradually the world of annotating lost its low form of humour, but now he's back and he's not alone, for this annotation SLockster has required the help of his dear friend King Leonidas for his 100th win on gameknot, a great celebration} e5 {standard reply at my level of chess} 2. Nf3 Bc5 {ahah so my chess friend believes I will fool for the lowest kind of mate, he believes that he may have an easy win against me as if to say to me,      "There will be no glory in your chess game. I will erase even the memory of Slockster from the histories! Every piece of G(r)eek parchment shall be burned. Every annotator, and every chess puzzler shall have their eyes pulled out, and their tongues cut from their mouths. Why, uttering the very name of Slockster, or Leonidas, will be punishable by death! The world will never know you existed at all! to wich I replied "The world will know that free pawns stood against a tyrant bishop, that small ratings stood against bigger ones, and before this game over, even a god-GM can bleed} 3. Nxe5 {I'll have that if you don't mind, } Bxf2+ 4. Kxf2 {bit of a bold sacrifice if you ask me, quite a lot of effort to prevent me from castling, I suppose the exposure is dangerous....} Qf6+ {oh no, he'll have my knight, bet he didn't expect this....} 5. Nf3 d6 {A thousand nations of Hotshower's empire descend upon you, there bishops will blot out the sun} 6. h3 {then we shall fight in the shade," I did this to prevent Bg4, it was already getting crowded..hang on.I'm sure I know a metaphor about this Oh yeah," Hotshowers dispatches his monsters from half the world away. They're clumsy beasts, and the piled Persian dead are slippery" its abot to get "slipprier" ,no "slippier", no "more slippy" Oh forget it} Nc6 {Knight to c6 intends to threaten knight on d4,"You have many pawns Xerxes, but fewer hardened warriors. It won't be long before they fear my knights more than your whips." } 7. d3 Nd4 8. Nbd2 {once again this situation is again safely returned to normal, However I was worried about Hotshower's cramp on my king side} Be6 {allows for castling} 9. c3 {his knight looks thirsty, well lets give him something to drink, to the cliffes} Nxf3 10. Nxf3 h6 11. g4 {We did what we were trained to do, what we were bred to do, what we were born to do! i.e ATTACK } g5 {ahh Immortal Pawns... we put their name to the test. } 12. d4 Ne7 {no retreat, no surrender, that is Slockster's law, and by Slockster law we shall fight and trade through mysterious yet brilliant gambits, a new age had begun and all will know that 32 pieces on an 8x8 checkered board gave their last breath to defend it, oh yeah the movement ummm Knight to e7 allows for castling on both sides and better access for rook} 13. e5 {This is the part where I spotted the open line, dxe5, dxe5 and an open d file} dxe5 14. dxe5 Qg7 15. Qa4+ {Offering of a draw. "You are generous as you are divine, O king of retreat. Such an offer only a madman would refuse. But the, uh, the idea of kneeling, it's- You see, slaughtering all those men of yours has, uh, well it's left a nasty cramp in my leg, so kneeling will be hard for me". } Nc6 {now I have allined myself, the bishop has easy access, } 16. Bb5 Bd5 {I have athought (suprisingly) this Bishop is a messanger and I play Leonidas for a famous scene  Messenger: Choose your next words carefully, Leonidas. They may be your last as king. King Leonidas: [to himself: thinking] "pawns and respect"? [Leonidas unsheathes and points his sword at the Messenger's throat] Messenger: Madman! You're a madman! King Leonidas:pawns and respect? You'll find plenty of both down there. Messenger: No man, annotator or Greek, no man threatens a bishop! King Leonidas: You bring the pawns and rooks of conquered kings to my walls. You insult my queen. You threaten my people with knights and queen! Oh, I've chosen my words carefully, Persian. Perhaps you should have done the same! Messenger: This is blasphemy! This is madness! King Leonidas: Madness...? [shouting] King Leonidas: This is Sparta! [Kicks the messenger down the well] } 17. Nd4 {0.5 of a blunder I move my knight, forgetting my rook, but this allows me to complete my attack on the black king} Bxh1 18. Nxc6 {Those behind cry, "FORWARD!" Those in front cry, "BACK!" no real value, thought I'd slip it in for old time's sake, I'll regain that rook while I'm at it} Bxc6 19. Bxc6+ Kd8 {clever, hadn't thought of that} 20. Bxb7 {still, onwardsa nd upwards as they say, not in 300 though sadly} Rb8 {this is effectively the final part of the game, from now on its checks to checkmate all the way} 21. Qxa7 {Our ancestors built this wall using ancient stones from the bosom of Greece herself. And with a little Spartan help, your Persian scouts supplied the mortar. } Ke7 22. Qc5+ {don't think your getting away that easily, you might think I do not have enough pieces for a checkmate, to which I use a scene to reply  Daxos: I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's commitment to at least match our own. King Leonidas: Doesn't it? [points to Arcadian soldier behind Daxos] King Leonidas: You there, what is your proffesion Free Greek-Potter: I am a secretary for low self esteemed pawns King Leonidas: [points to another soldier] And you, Arcadian, what is your profession? Free Greek-Sculptor: banker who ruined the economy (hint hint, get out G Brown) King Leonidas: Idiot. [turns to a third soldier] King Leonidas: You? Free Greek-Blacksmith: bishop for foreign affairs. King Leonidas: [turns back shouting] Spartans! What is your profession? Spartans: HA-OOH! HA-OOH! HA-OOH! King Leonidas: [turning to Daxos] You see, old friend? I brought more soldiers than you did. } Kd8 {Immortals... they fail our king's test. And a man who fancies himself a god feels a very human chill crawl up his spine. the hotshowers is beaten further and furthr back} 23. Bc6 {moving in for the kill, suitable quote for this point, ahh yes,"The old ones say we Slocksters are descended from Hercules himself. Bold Leonidas gives testament to our bloodline. His roar is long and loud} Qf8 {no, Hotshowers I am not going to exchange queens that would be thick, take that....} 24. Qd5+ Kc8 {We are with you, sire! For Sparta, for freedom, to the death! In coming death imminant} 25. Qd7# {and so i a turn around for the bookies Slockster/Leonidas defeated the Persian Xerxes/Hotshowers to win his 100th victory, thanks for listening, now go back and comment}
