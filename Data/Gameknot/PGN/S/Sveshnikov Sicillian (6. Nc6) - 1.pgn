1. e4 c5 {Part of a series of annotated games where I explore the Sveshnikov Sicillian. See my annotated games list for other examples.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {The signature move of the Sveshnikov Sicillian} 6. Nxc6 {The exchange variation seems to allow white to avoid lots of mainline theory, but it also allows black to play his freeing move ..d5 much more easily and achieve equality sooner} bxc6 7. Bc4 {Otherwise black will play ..d5 immediately} d6 8. O-O Be7 9. Be3 O-O {Equality, although I like the position for black due to the dynamic potential of ..d5} 10. a3 Be6 {Still following theory} 11. Bxe6 fxe6 12. f4 exf4 13. Rxf4 e5 {This begins a period of aggressive play by black} 14. Rf5 {Threatening a kingside attack with Rg5} g6 {Weakening black's kingside, but he hopes to grab the initiative soon} 15. Rf1 d5 16. exd5 cxd5 {I liked the position at this point for black. His pawns control the centre, and threaten to roll forward, pressuring white and perhaps creating holes in his defences to allow black to execute a kingside attack} 17. Bg5 Qb6+ 18. Kh1 d4 19. Bxf6 Bxf6 20. Nd5 Qd6 21. c4 {Creating a knight outpost on d5} e4 {Now black has 2 passed pawns. But white can get his queenside pawns rolling soon also, so black must pay attention} 22. Rxf6 {An elegant loss of the exchange, and dynamic play from white, that transforms the position} Rxf6 23. Qxd4 Re6 24. Re1 {At first glance this looks like a win for black, based on him being the exchange up. Looking more closely it is clear that the position holds lots of potential for white, and black might have to fight for a draw. The 3 queenside pawns are extremely dangerous, and black lacks open files to whip his rooks around the board and create threats. White's queen is central exerting powerful influence and controls the only entry point into white's defences (the f2 square) as well as being well positioned to support a queenside pawn roller. Black has a real problem, and can easily lose. Its important for black to play actively, and create more open lines for his rooks (even at the cost of material) otherwise soon white will have pawns on the sixth rank and black will be fighting for a draw. } Qe5 {Exchanging off queens, perhaps black will be able to penetrate white's position on the f file, and get his e pawn rolling. This will make the middlegame easier for black} 25. Qe3 {White wisely keeps queens on the board. Black needs to come up with a strategy quickly} Rf8 {Taking the open file} 26. Rb1 {Or 26. b4 immediately. What do you think black's plan should be?} a5 {A clever move. Black wants to open the a file, even at the risk of giving white 2 clear passed pawns after b4 ab, ab. Ideally he will then play ..Ra8 when his rook will be able to break into white's position} 27. b3 {White is in no hurry. Let black make a rash move} g5 {!!? This leads to extremely sharp play. Black now seeks play against the white king via the hfile.  White in the process may be able to win black's e and a pawns. And white will also be able to move much more freely on the queenside now one of black's rooks is out of the way.  If I lacked time to analyse and needed to avoid a loss, I would have played the cautious ..Rc8 instead} 28. Kg1 {Yes} Rh6 29. h3 {Best} Rf3 {An interesting idea. The rook cannot be taken. e.g. 30. gf Qg3+ 31. Kf1 Qxh3+ 32. Ke1 Qg2 with advantage to black} 30. Qc5 {The strongest move. Black is fully committed now to losing his a-pawn and allowing white to generate his own threats involving queen and knight.} Kg7 {Critical} 31. Qa7+ {Best} Rf7 32. Qxa5 {.} g4 33. Qc3 Qxc3 34. Nxc3 gxh3 35. Nxe4 Rg6 36. Rb2 {36. Kh2 Rf4, 37.. Rfg4 was also possible } Rf4 37. Nc3 hxg2 38. Rxg2 Rf3 39. Rxg6+ Kxg6 {White resigns}
