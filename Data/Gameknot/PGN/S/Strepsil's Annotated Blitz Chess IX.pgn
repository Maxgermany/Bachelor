1. e4 {My favorite first move. King's pawn defense.} e5 {He replies, mirroring my first move.} 2. Nf3 {I threaten his pawn and develop my knight.} Nc6 {He protects with his knight.} 3. d4 {I attack his e-pawn, being protected by my queen and my knight.} exd4 {He takes my pawn with his own.} 4. Nxd4 {I take with the knight.} Qf6 {I thought he would just take the knight, but he decides to put pressure on it instead.} 5. Nxc6 {I just simply take the knight.} dxc6 {He takes back, now with doubled up pawns and an open king.} 6. Nc3 {Developing.} Bd7 {My opponent looking to castle queenside.} 7. h4 {Now, if he castles queenside, I will pin his queen to his rook.} O-O-O {He falls for the trap, and castles queenside.} 8. Bg5 {I pin his queen to his rook with my bishop.} Qg6 {Moves out of the way.} 9. Bxd8 {I take his rook.} Kxd8 {He takes my bishop and now I am +2 and in a good position.} 10. Qf3 {Wanting to develop my bishop, I protect the g2 square.} Nf6 {He develops his knight.} 11. Bd3 {I develop my bishop, preparing: e5, threatening his knight with my pawn and his queen with my bishop.} Bg4 {He threatens my queen.} 12. Qe3 {I move out of the way.} Nh5 {Moves out of the threat, but now his knight is trapped.} 13. e5 {I threaten his queen anyway.} Bf5 {Blocks with the bishop.} 14. Bxf5 {Swap accepted.} Qxf5 {He takes back with the queen.} 15. O-O-O+ {I castle queenside, checking the king.} Kc8 {After this bad move, my opponent abandoned the game, probably because he didn't want to be beaten by a player with 500 less rating than him.}
