[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 {A simple Philidor, nothing much to see here.} 3. d4 f6 4. d5 {White would rather pressure Black's position than go for the bloodbath in the center of the board.} c6 5. Bc4 Ne7 {White is amassing the forces, while Black is content to dig in and get ready to attack later.} 6. O-O Bd7 {Black is packing his pieces in.  It looks rather cramped.  Something will happen soon though, as White will not get through Black's defense without blasting through Black's center.} 7. dxc6 Bxc6 8. Bd5 Bxd5 9. exd5 {We have traded bishop and pawn; Black's center formation looks relatively secure but more development for both sides would be nice.} Nf5 10. Nc3 Be7 11. g4 Nh6 12. g5 Nf5 {White still attacking, although it will take more than this to get through Black's center.} 13. gxf6 Bxf6 14. Bg5 {A bad attack.  White is trying to pin the bishop, but evidently has forgotten that the bishop can attack.  A lost piece.} Bxg5 15. Nxg5 Qxg5+ 16. Kh1 {Black now has the upper hand - the king in the corner and unable to move - and who is attacking now?  The tables have turned.} Nh4 17. Rg1 {A cheap checkmate attempt, which White sees through easily enough.} Qf6 18. Qd3 O-O 19. Raf1 Nd7 {The kingside is heating up.  Black apparently falling back into defense again.} 20. f4 {An opening salvo to open a few things up.} exf4 21. Rg4 Ng6 {Black eschews the 21...g5 opportunity, which would be aggressive defense but would possibly leave the king open to more attack.} 22. Qh3 {A curious move - Ne2 might have been better.} Nde5 23. Ne4 {Attacks for both sides, White's looking more dangerous despite being a bishop and pawn down.} Qf7 24. Ng5 h6 {A bad mistake for Black.  A lost queen, certainly not to put Black out of the game but it won't make things easy.} 25. Nxf7 Rxf7 26. Rxg6 Nxg6 {A mistake by White to put Black back in the game.  I see Black as slightly ahead.} 27. Qe6 Nf8 28. Qxd6 Nh7 {Black doesn't have a whole lot of moves, yet his king looks reasonably secure.  He will need help to get out of this one though.} 29. Rxf4 Raf8 30. Qe6 Ng5 31. Qe5 {Black has turned the tables.  White has a free rook.} Rf7xf4 32. d6 {White may as well tie up one of Black's rooks and threaten a promotion.} Rf4f1+ 33. Kg2 Rf8f2+ 34. Kg3 Rxc2 {Might as well gobble up a pawn while we're down there.} 35. d7 Rg1+ 36. Kf4 Rf2+ 37. Ke3 Rf8 {The forced movement of the king is no longer viable and the pawn has to be dealt with.} 38. Qd5+ Nf7 {A counter to the queen's defense of the promotion square.} 39. Kf2 Rg5 40. Qc4 {White must give up on the pawn.} Rd8 41. Qd3 Rc5 42. b4 Rc7 {The pawn to be taken, finally.} 43. a4 Rcxd7 {White trying to put some pressure on Black's remaining pawns, but Black is forcing the queen to move. This will be over before long.} 44. Qc4 Rf8 45. b5 b6 46. Qc6 Ne5+ {This could have been done a move before but it does the same thing. White resigned here, his mistakes having been worse than Black's.}
