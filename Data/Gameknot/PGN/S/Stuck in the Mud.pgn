1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4 O-O 5. g3 d6 6. Bg2 Nbd7 {Normally I play 6...Nc6, the Panno Variation; but I been reading some Joe Gallagher.  Gallagher felt that the type of players that played the Fianchetto Variation liked to feel in control and the way get them out of their comfort zone was to create chaos on the board and disrupt the flow of their games.  So I play ...Ndb7 hoping to be able to transpose into the Gallagher Variation.} 7. O-O e5 8. e4 a6 9. d5 Ne8 {Played with the idea of 10. Bd2 c5 making it difficult for White to get his thematic queenside play.} 10. Nh4 {What is this? White is playing for f4.  I decided it was time to switch plans and go for the traditional KID kingside attack by Black.} f5 11. exf5 gxf5 12. f4 e4 {Played with some regret.  Visually I didn't like my position, but I have a supported passed pawn and White's h4-Knight is on the rim and no easy way back into the game.  I remembered Larsen once summing up a position as both sides stand badly.  That seemed to apply here.} 13. Be3 Ndf6 {Here Fritz recommends 13...Nc5.  During the game I missed the fact that White can't play 14.b4?.} 14. h3 Bh8 {Better is Fritz's suggestion of 14...c5.} 15. Ne2 Ng7 {I was definitely wishing I had played the Panno at this point.} 16. Rc1 b6 {Once again 16...c5 could be played.} 17. b4 Rf7 18. Qb3 Nge8 {Fritz suggests 18...b5} 19. Rfd1 Nh5 {My pieces are starting to uncoil, White's h4 knight is still a longways from getting back into the game, and my Kingside action is starting to take shape.  I was starting to feel better about things.} 20. Bd4 {?! Fritz recommends 20.Bf2} Bxd4+ {Normally Black dislikes parting with his ds Bishop, but I wanted to get my f7 rook to g7 without having to worry about a White bishop on the long diagonal. } 21. Nxd4 Nxf4 {?! stronger is 21...Qf6.  Black's move here helps solve White's h4-knight problem.} 22. gxf4 {?! better was 22.Nhxf5 which would have kept White in the game.} Qxh4 {Here White resigned.  I felt somewhat prematurely.  Black certainly has a large advantage, but there is a ways to go.}
