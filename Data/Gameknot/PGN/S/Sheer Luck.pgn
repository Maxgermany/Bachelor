[Opening "Three knights game (C46)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {We begin with the Three Knights Opening.  You couldn't call this an Attack, rather, it's a non-committal debut that keeps White's options open.  Possibly the downside is that it keeps Black's options open as well.} Bc5 {A good developing move.  Equally good is 3...Nf6: the Four Knights Opening, if White plays 4.Bb5; the Giuoco Pianissimo or Two Knight's defence if 4.Bc4.  Here White can transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo if she plays 4.Bc4...} 4. a3 {[4.a3?!]  Given that Black has already decided to place his Bishop on c5, this move is probably less good than moving her own Light Square Bishop (LSB) to c4 or b5.  White could be aiming for an eventual strike at the bishop on c5, but whilst preparing this, Black can make better use of her time.  I've given the move a 'dubious' mark (?!) rather than a 'mistake' (?), as it is playable enough, and doesn't seriously compromise White's game.} Nf6 5. Bb5 O-O {Fine: too many players at this level worry overmuch about doubled pawns, which would arise if White were to play Bxc6.  It might be objected, though, that as the situation stands, White can pick up Black's e-pawn into the bargain.  That is certainly what White thought...} 6. Bxc6 {Playable, even if White were not interested in Black's e-pawn...} dxc6 {[dxc6!] Yes!  The better recapture, in my view.  The reason will be revealed later...} 7. Nxe5 {[Nxe5?]  White thinks she has won a free pawn, as well as doubling a pair of Black pawns on the c-file.  But the thing about that Black e-pawn was that that morsel was sauced with a hefty dollop of poison...} Be6 {[...Be6?]  Not Black's best response to White's raid.  There were two ways Black could have gone about visiting his retribution upon White: [A]: 7...Re8!?  8.f4 ... and now comes the really juicy bit: 8... Nxe4!! 9.Nxe4 Rxe5!!  10.fxe5 ... Black is a whole rook down, for what?  This is for what:  10...Qh4ch (Everyone has seen this sort of attack before!)  11.Kf1 (11.Ng3 Bg4!) ...Qxe4  12.Qe2 Qxc2.  At this point, though still the exchange down, Black's superior mobility should ensure that he keeps White bailed up for a long time to come.  But that isn't even the best line!  Try this [B]:  7...Qd4!  This move attacks the Knight at e5, and the f2-square (...Qxf2#) simultaneously.  How can White defend?  There is but one way to save both: 8.Nd3! Nxe4  9.Ne2! Qf6!  10.f3! ... This weakening move is just about forced, so heavy is the pressure against f2; 10...Qh4ch  11.Kf1 Rd8 (Threatening to take out the remaining defence of f2)  12.Qe1 Qf6  13.Nxc5 Nxc5.  At this point, although White has successfully repulsed Black's heavy attack, Black has got his pawn back, and retains the more mobile position.  Exciting stuff, eh?} 8. Qf3 {[8.Qf3!?]  Probably OK, though if for any reason the e5-Knight has to retreat, d3 is where it will have to go.  That's safe enough but could be inconvenient if White wants to advance her d-pawn and develop her Queen's Bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.} Qd4 {A move too late, but it still forces the knight back to the unhandy square, d3.} 9. Nd3 Rad8 {[...Rad8?]  Desirable though this development is, Black had a bit of tidying up to do first.  Unhandy as the d3-square is for the Knight standing on it, Black ought to have deprived White of a cheap means of rectifying the situation.  White could now have played 10.Nxc5 Qxc5  11.d3 (rubbing it in) with a fine game, having kept hold of her stolen pawn.   So a better move than the text would have been 9...Bb6.} 10. e5 {[e5?!]  Much better was 10.Nxc5!  Although after 10.e5 Nd7  11.Nxc5 Qxc5 White sorts out the situation on the d-file, Black will be able to win back the e-pawn and re-establish material equality, with about a level game.} Ng4 {Going after the e-pawn, and with an eye on f2 as well.  But now 11.Ne2 followed by 12.h3 would have forced the Black queen and knight away, and left white with a perfectly tenable game.} 11. Ne4 {[11.Ne4?!]  Plausible looking, but Black now picks up the e-pawn with extreme prejudice...} Nxe5 {Not only restoring the material balance, but with attack as well.} 12. Nexc5 {[12.Nexc5??]  For the level of play we are looking at here, this is the first really serious mistake by either side.  Quite why White thought she could get away with Black playing 12...Nxf3ch, I can't imagine.  But even after White's best try, 12.Nxe5, Black would have come out with the better chances: 12.Nxe5 Qxe5 (it appears that 12...Bd5! would have been equally strong) 13.0-0 Bd5.  The pin against the Knight at e4 would have been a real bone in the throat for White.} Bg4 {[..Bg4??]  An unnecessary finesse, shall we say?  Instead, 12...Nxf3ch (this would have been good even without the 'check')  13.gxf3 Bd5 and Black would have been comfortably ahead a Queen for two Knights.} 13. Nxe5 {[13.Nxe5??]  There must be something going wrong with White's calculations.  Instead of this, 13.Qg3 would have kept White in the game, and, better yet, 13.Qe3 would have put White on top!  Here's the plot:  13.Qe3!! Nxd3ch  14.cxd3!! ... (This is the key to White's defence.  She can now hold out) 14...Rfe8  15.Ne4 f5 (The raging attack is still coming in, but White can now step out from behind her shield wall with an infantry advance on the right flank:)  16.h3! Bh4  17.g4 fxe4  (17...Bg6  18.gxf5 and the pin at e4 loses most of its effect)  18.Qxd4 Rxd4  19.gxh5 exd3ch 20.Kf1.  Under siege for so long, White emerges ahead a Bishop for 2 Pawns.  Once she mobilizes her reserves, Black will have a fight on his hands simply to hold a draw.} Qxe5+ {[13...Qxe5ch]  Once again finding the hard way.  13...Bxf3 would have been winning.} 14. Qe3 {[14.Qe3!]  Correct! Now Black is in trouble, his attack finally being repulsed.} Rfe8 {This move was probably the best Black had, threatening to recover his lost piece by 15...Qxc5, or else place further shackles upon the White Queen half-pinned at e3.  But White can escape this, with one simple developing move...} 15. Nd3 {[15.Nd3??]  This isn't it.  Instead 15.0-0! would have broken the pin after which White kept her extra material, and her advantage.} Qe6 {[15...Qe6?]  Black must have forgotten that had the Queen moved off the e-file, the Rook standing at e8 maintained the pin, whereat Black won Queen for Rook, and hence entered a favourable endgame with a Queen versus Rook and Knight.  Once more White has been given the chance to castle out of the pin.  Mind you, things have become more complicated by now, as will be seen.  Suffice to say that almost any Queen move off the  e-file would have given Black fine winning chances. } 16. Qxe6 {[16.Qxe6??] Essential was 16.0-0.  However, things have become much more complicated, and even 16.0-0 wasn't quite a 'gimme' escape: 16.0-0 Qd6  17.Qg3 (say) Be2!  18.Qxd6 cxd6 (undoubling pawns and depriving the White Knight of 5th rank squares).  But now what should White play?  If she tries to save her rook, this happens: 19.Re1 Bxd3!  and the bishop can not be taken - now or after 20.Rxe8 Rxe8 - on account of the back rank mate!  So White would have to be content with 21.Nf4! Bxf1  22.Kxf1 ... and an endgame with two minor pieces versus a rook.  Such an ending would have been very favourable for White, but technically difficult for both sides.} Bxe6 {[16...Bxe6?!]  Given the obviousness of 16...Rxe6ch, this move is very hard to comprehend.  Once again, White is let off the hook whilst Black hangs himself out to dry.  After 16...Rxe6ch Black would have won easily:  17.Kf1 Be2ch  and now [A] 18.Ke1 Bxd3ch  19.Kd1 Be2ch  20.Ke1 Bg4ch!  21.Kf1 Rde8 and, faced with mate, White must lose material: 22.f3 Re1ch  23.Kf2 Rxh1; or [B]  18.Kg1 Bxd3  19.h3 Bxc2 and although Black emerges with the single extra pawn, so huge is his edge in mobility that White will have to offer up more material just so she can move a piece.} 17. O-O {Breaking at last Black's attack down the e-file.  This move is fine, but White could just about have dared Black to do his worst: 17.f3 ...(say, with the view to moving the King to f2)  17...Bb3ch (the only discovered check that is of any use to Black, now)  18.Kd1! Rxd3!  19.cxb3 Rxb3.  Black would have remained a piece down, and he would not have been able indefinitely to maintain his bind on White's position.  Once mobilized, White's extra minor piece would have been decisive.} Bf5 {Slightly better might have been 17...Bc4 with much the same idea in mind, but placing a pin on the Knight.  Pins have been a bit of a feature of this game.} 18. Nb4 {I think I would have been tempted to play 18.Ne1, here, with the idea 19.d3 and develop the bishop to e3 and the Knight to f3.} c5 19. Na2 {It was this or back to d3.  The problem with the latter is that Black wins a pawn from the resulting exchange, and White finds it difficult to mobilize her pieces.  I'd still fancy White's chances, but it would take very patient play to establish a supremacy and make progress.} Re2 {The obvious 19.Bxc2 would have been fine.  Black could not have maintained his rook on the seventh rank after 20.Nc3!} 20. c3 {Good enough, but 20.Nc3 would have chased Black rook away, after which 21.d3 would have seen White rapidly mobilizing her uncommitted reserves.} Rde8 {Black might have been better advised to keep the clamps on as much as he could by 20...c4 or ...Bd3.  Now White could have broken out by 21.d4! with the idea 21...cxd4 22.cxd4 Bd3  23.Be3 Rxb2  24.Rfd1  Bc4  25.Nc3 and White is gradually crawling out of the box; or 21...Bd3  22.Bg5 Rxb2  23.Rfe1 Rxe1ch  24.Rxe1 f6  25.Nc1 Bf5  26.Bf4 and Black has only two pawns for a Knight in the endgame.} 21. f3 Bd3 {[21...Bd3!]  Fine move.  Black is making the best of the chance he's been given here, and reimposes a bind on White's centre and Queen side.  A piece ahead in the endgame, White is finding it hard to come up with a plan to free her game and to assert her material advantage.  } 22. b4 {A spirited try...} c4 {I quite like the thinking behind this move, but it might have allowed White once more to find a way to free her game after 23.h3!  Instead, Black could have forced White seriously to consider accepting a draw by playing 22...R2e6!  23.Rd1 Bc2!  24.Rf1 Bd3  25.Rd1 etc.  The only way White could have broken the deadlock would have been by offering the exchange:  23.Bb2 Bxf1  24.Kxf1 c4, and even then any winning chances remaining to her would have been at best problematical.} 23. Bb2 {Hoping to break out.  But 23.h3  would have stymied Black's scheme of 23...R2e6  24.Rf2 Re1ch  25.Kh2.  Now Black wins the exchange and brings the material situation to near equality.} Rxd2 24. Bc1 {Suddenly White is in serious difficulty.  It looks all right superficially: threatened with the loss of the exchange, White has a counter-threat, and if the d2-Rook moves, the bishop has at last obtained an open diagonal for itself.  That was no doubt the idea behind her last two or three moves, and if so, the plan deserved a better fate.    The problem, though, is the 2nd rank, and the enemy rook's occupation of it.} Rc2 {[24...Rc2!]  Excellent.  Absolutely the right move: now both Black rooks will establish themselves upon White's 2nd rank.  This is well worth a whole minor piece.} 25. b5 {Desperate: White so wants Black to take her rook on f1....} Ree2 {No dice.  Black cuts to the denouement.  White has only one good move, but even that will cost her a rook.} 26. Nb4 {[26.Nb4??]  Answering one threat, but overlooking a greater.  It is mate in 3.} Rexg2+ 27. Kh1 Rce2 {[28...Rce2??]  Instead 28...Rxh2ch  29.Kg1 Rg2#.  The Knight on b4 is no more than a scarecrow...  But having scared the crows, White now wins a reprieve...} 28. Bf4 {Stops the Mate!  In fact, so strong is this move in the circumstances, White might well have turned the tables.  There is no mate, the Black bishop is under attack - Black might have had to drop into an unfavourable endgame by 28...Ref2  29.Rxf2 Rxf2  30.Nxd3 cxd3  31.Rd1 Rxf3  32.Bxc7... } Bf5 29. Rae1 {[29.Rae1!]  A very awkward situation for Black!  He daren't play 29...Rxe1  30.Rxe1 as his other rook is attacked and he is faced with a back rank mate at the same time, and no means to avert both.  More than likely he'd have to play something like 29...f6 and allow White to exchange on e2.} Rgxh2+ {[Rxh2ch??]  An oversight, or desperation?  Either way, this loses at once...} 30. Kg1 {[30.Kg1??] Unbelievable ...and this is the 'sheer luck' id=eltonj was talking about.  Having found the move not only to stop the mate but to turn the tables as well, and with just 2 legal moves available, White finds exactly the wrong one.  30.Bxh2 would have won outright, as Black would have had no option (owing to the threat of a 'back rank' mate) but to play 30...Rxe1  31.Rxe1 and go a Rook and minor piece behind.  You do not often see so stark a 50-50 call as this!} Reg2# {Game over.  And what a game!  Both sides had clear cut winning chances, in a game that had plenty of tactics available.  This is good one to go over for its tactical motifs: the fork (and other types of double attack), the pin, back-rank mates, and rook/rooks on the 2nd/7th rank.}
