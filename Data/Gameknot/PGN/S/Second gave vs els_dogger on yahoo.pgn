[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Morphy defence"]

1. e4 {KP opening.  Finally something I am more familiar with.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Textbook Ruy Lopez} a6 {a6 variation} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d4 d6 6. Nc3 b5 7. Bb3 exd4 8. Nxd4 Bb7 {I should have just taken his knight.  It's too central and he has all of the center.  } 9. O-O Be7 {I was anticipating castling, but I should have anticipated his attack.  The bishop could have waited.  g6, or something that restricts the movement of his knight, would have been more prudent.} 10. Nf5 {that worries me a little} O-O 11. Bg5 {My defense is still fairly solid.  How can I ruin it? } Nxe4 {Thats how.} 12. Nxe7+ Nxe7 13. Nxe4 Bxe4 14. Re1 {I completely did NOT see that coming.  I spent a good 2 minutes of my clock trying to see a way out here.} d5 {Yeah, blocking half my escape options.  Great.} 15. f3 Bxf3 16. Qxf3 Re8 17. Bxd5 c6 18. Bxf7+ {Missed that one.} Kh8 19. Bxe8 Qb6+ 20. Kh1 Rxe8 21. Rxe7 {Didn't think that one through either.  I resigned. What really bothers me is that, initially, I feel MUCH more comfortable with this opening.  My thoughts are that since I felt more comfortable, I was a bit more reckless in my midgame.  In the QP game before this, I was more careful because I was less comfortable with the opening.  There's a lesson in there somewhere.}
