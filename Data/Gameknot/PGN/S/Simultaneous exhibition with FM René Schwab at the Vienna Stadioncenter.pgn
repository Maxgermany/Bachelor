[Round "1"]
[White "René Schwab (~2200)"]
[Black "Sebastian Falbesoner (~1500)"]
[Opening "French (C01), exchange, Svenonius variation"]

1. e4 e6 {Assuming that my opponent will probably prefer to play quite sharp and attacking openings as White in a simultaneous game, I chose a solid defence with the French.} 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 {The French exchange variation, which leads quite often to a draw (37% according to the GameKnot "World" database).} 4. Bf4 {4. Bd3 or 4. Nf3 are far more common moves here.} Bf5 {Just trying to maintain symmetry which is a well-known technique for Black in the French exchange variation to achieve a draw. However, this move leaves my pawn on b7 undefended and my opponent doesn't hesitate to exploit that...} 5. Qe2+ {I was quite surprised by this early queen check - but the next moves will show that I lose a pawn at force!} Be7 {Forcing the queen exchange with 5... Qe7 loses also a pawn because of 6. Bxc7!} 6. Qb5+ {The b7 pawn falls for sure, I can't do anything about it.} c6 {I guess 6... Nc6 (developing the knight and defending my rook) followed by 7... Rc8 would have been better.} 7. Qxb7 Nd7 {The only move to defend my rook on a8.} 8. Nc3 {I wonder why my opponent didn't take the next free pawn on c6?} Qc8 {Offering a queen exchange, to avoid the loss of more pawns.} 9. Qxc8+ {The opponent accepts.} Rxc8 10. O-O-O {Unfortunately I didn't have time to take the undefended pawn on c2, now as my opponent castles queenside it's too late.} Ngf6 {Preparing to castle kingside and getting more control of e4.} 11. h3 {Probably preparing g4.} O-O 12. f3 {Avoids to let my knight go to e4 and prepares g4 once more ;-)} Rfe8 13. g4 {Ah, here it comes. White's pawns are getting quite annoying at the kingside, at the price that two of his minor pieces aren't developed yet.} Bg6 {I didn't want to block the e-file with 13... Be6, and this was the only alternative, which keeps the bishop on the fine b1-h7 diagonal.} 14. h4 {Of course, the opponents wants to make use of his pawn-wall and catch my bishop.} h6 {The only sane move in this situation, any other will lose material.} 15. Bd3 {Forcing the exchange of white-squared bishops. } Nb6 {I decided not to take, but instead developing my knight on the queenside. If White takes my bishop, I get a doubled pawn, but it also opens the f-file, I thought it can be of some use maybe.} 16. Bxg6 {Okay, he takes.} fxg6 17. b3 {Controls a4 and c4, which are potential homes for my knight, but leaves his own knight on c3 undefended...} Bb4 {... so why not attack it?} 18. Nb1 {I expected 18. Nce2, I don't think the knight is very well-placed here. However, it avoids that my bishop reaches the a3 square.} h5 {Trying to get rid of my doubled pawns. I overlooked that the opponent can simply play g5 -- the doubled pawns remain and my knight has to leave it's place on f6.} 19. c3 {White decides to shoo my bishop first.} Bf8 {The other possibility, 19... Be7, would have blocked the e-file.} 20. g5 {That had to come.} Nfd7 21. Nh3 {Developing his knight and connecting the rooks. The knight is not very active here, but it's the only square it can go to.} c5 {! Opens up the powerful c-file. According to a nearby kiebitz, the opponent said "Respekt!" when he saw this move, but I'm not sure because I couldn't understand him accoustically. } 22. Rhe1 {At this point I'm happy to know that I win my lost pawn back!} Rxe1 23. Rxe1 cxd4 {Phew, material is even again.} 24. Rd1 {For this and the following moves White thought quite a bit longer than usual (that means, more than 15 seconds ;-)).} dxc3 {I thought it probably can't hurt to take one more pawn - not expecting that I can hold it for very long.} 25. Kc2 a5 {25... Bb4 was tempting but doesn't really lead to anything because of 26. a3, and my bishop has to move back again.} 26. Rd3 {Attacking it three times, there's no doubt anymore that White will get the pawn on c3 back.} Nb8 {Has then intention of reaching b4 via Nb8-a6-c4.} 27. Rxc3 Rxc3+ 28. Nxc3 Bb4 {??? being blind as a bat, I don't see that since the rook exchange, my knight on b8 is not defended any more.} 29. Bxb8 {At this point I resigned. Mr. Schwab was very nice and offered to take the move back and play another one instead "to keep the game interesting". I happily agreed and played 28... Nc6 instead of my blunder, but lost the game after approx. 12 moves anyway, because I couldn't avoid the queening of his a-pawn at the end.  However, the event was great fun and I encourage all interested chess players in Vienna to participate in one of the future tournaments or simultaneous exhibitions organized by the "Schachfreund", it's really nice. Not to forget, five participants achieved a draw against the FIDE Master, hats off!}
