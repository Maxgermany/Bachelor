1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 {Scotch game. I play the Scotch to avoid book lines and develop my own theories in chess. It is good to know self knowledge when your in middle and end games.} d6 {A semi-Philidor's?} 4. dxe5 {offering a trade of queen's} Bg4 {I believe it is not best to go munching on pawns at this moment} 5. Bb5 {Pining the knight and preparing to castle king side.  If I played pawn exd6 he could capture with the queen or bishop and would then be in the lead of development. This is the start of my squeezing my opponent } Bxf3 6. Qxf3 dxe5 7. O-O Qd7 8. Rd1 Bd6 {Two pieces pined! Squeezing him! His are going to be cramp up in this game} 9. Qg3 {I do not know if there was a better continuation of the game.} g6 {?! how about f6} 10. Nc3 {And with this move I thought well it is better to start with moving the queen's knight than the bishop. Still, I was unsure on how to proceed the game.} Nge7 {When black moved his knight here I had a idea} 11. Nd5 {If he played Nxd5 I recapture with my e pawn and win the c6 knight on the next move!} O-O-O {?! I believe it was safer on the king side} 12.
