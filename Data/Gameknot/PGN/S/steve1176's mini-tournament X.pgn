1. e4 {Finally!  After a succession of defeats by this opponent I finally got him, though not without a few hairy moments on the way.} e5 2. f4 {I hate non standard openings. People should have the decency to play Ruy Lopez.} d6 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. h4 Nc6 5. Be2 Bxf3 6. Bxf3 Nd4 7. O-O {Not sure whether he forgot the pawn or wasn't fussed there.} Qxh4 8. d3 Qg3 {Looking back at this now, that doesn't look as good as it did at the time. I probably should have taken more time to develop but in situ I was just trying to keep my opponent off balance and reacting rather than having the initiative.} 9. Nd2 {Another odd one} Qxf4 10. Nc4 Qg3 11. Be3 Nxf3+ 12. Rxf3 Qg6 {Bit of a developmental problem now. Despite the cushion of 2 pawns I'm very aware I hadn't ever beaten this fellow.} 13. Qd2 Nf6 14. Raf1 Be7 {So its pile out time to try and develop something.} 15. Bg5 O-O 16. Bh6 {Took me a moment to see the reasoning for this one, the potential for pinning the queen to the king, still think it was a very brave move.} gxh6 {But free(ish) bishop.... I'm greedy enough to fall for it.} 17. Rh3 Kh8 {Quite willing to hand the pawn back but didn't want the pin happening. Nearly cost me dearly.} 18. Rxh6 Qg7 {I figured that was the safest place, considering the double attack on the knight.} 19. Rh3 Rfg8 {My original intent was to try and exchange queens next move.} 20. Rff3 Qf8 {Can't quite rem why I changed my mind. } 21. Ne3 Rg6 22. Nf5 {I can see the h6 space being filled with a rook or queen and then backed up threatening h7.} Ng8 {Trying to stop the danger at h6.} 23. Rfg3 Rxg3 24. Rxg3 {Quite happy to swap material.} c6 {Bit of a negative move really. Content to let him take the tempo for a moment.} 25. Rh3 d5 26. c3 Rd8 27. exd5 Rxd5 28. c4 Rd8 29. a3 b6 {Neither of us willing to commit on the kingside, so both playing slow and steady.} 30. b4 e4 31. Qf4 exd3 32. Qe5+ {That caught me a bit by surprise. Was expecting him to backtrack.} f6 33. Qe1 d2 34. Qd1 Qf7 35. Nh6 Nxh6 36. Rxh6 Qxc4 37. Rxh7+ Kxh7 38. Qh5+ Kg7 {And since I can force the queen exchange and/or promote he resigned at that point. Always satisfying to finally beat a bogey player!}
