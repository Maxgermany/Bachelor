1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Queen's Gambit...} e6 {...Declined.  This is the classical method of declining the gambit, though these days 2...c6 is more popular (and my usual choice as well).  The text can lead to problems of developing Black's light-square bishop.} 3. Nf3 {More commonly played is 3.Nc3, but hereabouts this opening is apt to transpose...} Nf6 4. Nc3 {... Like this... But White has a wide range of options, here.  Normally, I play 4.g3, but 4.Bg5 (an erstwhile favourite of mine) and 4.e3 are both very good lines.  Plenty of room for experiment then.} Bb4 {Ragozin Defence.  Here we have a parting of ways.  Black has a wide range of playable possibilities too: 4...Be7 and 4...c6 are very popular.  Here Black threatens the well-known motif: 5...Ne4.} 5. cxd5 {This exchange rivals 5.Bg5 for popularity, and 5.Qa4ch (...Nc6), played, among others, by GM Hikaru Nakamura,  is also a very playable line.  The text seems to be World Champion Magnus Carlsen's choice.} exd5 {Probably best, though ...Nxd5 has been tried.} 6. Bg5 {Stymieing Black's threat to exploit the pin at c3, by imposing a counter-pin at f6.} O-O {A fairly surprising choice: in effect, Black ignores the pin.  Two other option are more frequently tried: [A] 6...h6 with this possible line - 7.Bh4 g5!? 8.Bg3 Ne4!? 9.Nd2! Nxc3 10.bxc3 Bxc3 11.Rc1 Ba5 12.e3  ... and White has  an active game for the pawn given up; [B] 6...Nbd7  7.e3 c5  8.Bd3 c4 9.Bf5 ... and anything might happen.  These are 'sample lines', of course.  Both sides have wide choices in either sequence.} 7. e3 {Instead, 7.Rc1 is often played, here, and certainly it is a handy looking square for the rook.  But it seems to me that completing the King-side development ought to take priority.} Be6 {Again, not the usual choice by Black, but that is not to criticise it.  Possibly Black was concerned to ensure adequate protection for the d-pawn, at the same time developing quickly.   More usual, though, is an early strike at the centre: 7...c5 8.dxc5 Nbd7  9.Rc1 ... when Black chooses between 9...Nxc5 and 9...Qa5.} 8. Bd3 {I have always liked the look of this type of position for White.} Nbd7 {(!?) Perhaps this was a good moment for Black to carry out the ...c5 strike.  } 9. O-O c6 {Black has chosen a fairly conservative, but solid approach to the game.  It's the sort of play I used to favour, but I always found it difficult to come up with a positive plan.  Hence my own preference for the King's Indian or Benoni type of defences.  At this point I was thinking in terms of a 'minority attack' - that is, a general advance of the a- and b-pawns, with the view to engaging the enemy Q-side pawns in the expectation that after exchanges, Black's majority would be reduced to an isolated or backward pawn on a file open to White's rooks.  There it would be a target, whilst White's counterpart, the e-pawn, would be quite safe from attack.} 10. a3 {A good alternative seems to be 10.Bf4, interdicting the dark squares in the middle of Black's position. How to follow it up seems to remain the question, though.} Bd6 {(!?) Very much a surprise: I quite expected the exchange here: 10...Bxc3 11.bxc3 h6  12.Bh4 Qa5  13.Qc2 c5 with a rough equality, and Black breaking out of the constraints of her earlier solid mobilisation.  Black seems to be interested, instead, in keeping as much material on the board as may be, or else wished to exchange it for nothing less than a bishop.  I have no quarrel with this.  The text seems to be quite playable.} 11. h3 {Partly to ensure no enemy minor piece is going to land on g4 from now on.  But this should also signal that White is not going to allow a bishop exchange on g3.  } Qc7 {This was the other reason for the h2-h3 advance.  Sure, h2 is adequately protected, but I might not have wanted the king's knight to be chained to its defence.} 12. Rc1 {'Put your rook on the line of the queen, whatever the pieces that intervene'.  The rook was intended for this square anyhow, but now was a very good time the play it.  If, now, 12...h6, hoping to win a pawn on f4, White has 13.Nb5! Qb8 14.Nxd6 Qxd6 (14...hxg5 15.Nf5) 15.Bf4.} a6 {[!]  Obviating Nb5 in the event of ...h6. It also rather discouraged the long term 'minority attack' idea I had been nursing along for several moves.  } 13. Qd2 {Played to permit the retreat that follows...} h6 14. Bf4 {(!)  Far better than Bh4, which might have been met by 14...g5 15.Bg3 Bxg3 16.fxg3 Qxg3 - reaching a position I didn't much like.  } Bxf4 {(!?) It is possible that Black might have been better off declining to exchange 'in her own time', and by, say, 14...Re8, invited me to trade 'in my time'.  Would I have made the trade on d6?  I rather don't think so, as the e5 square in that case wouldn't be much use to me.  Instead, the c5-square might, which would suggest a sequence like b2-b4 ...; Nc3-a4 ...; Na4-c5 ... to occupy that outpost instead.} 15. exf4 {Now the e5-square looks like a splendid outpost for a White knight.} Nb6 {Heading for c4, and to challenge White's tenure of e5, or to menace the White b-pawn.} 16. Ne5 Nc4 17. Qe2 {No good would come of the immediate exchange on c4.  Even with this move White is not definitely committed to the exchange. } Nd6 {Heading for e4.  Although not as secure an outpost as e5 (on account of f2-f3) such a move would have a certain nuisance value.  I had been half-expecting 17...Qb6 18.Rfd1! with the idea [A] 18...Qxd4?? 19.Bh7ch or [B] 18...Qxb2 19.Bxc4!  or [C] 18...Nxb2 19.Rb1.  The text-move presents different problems.} 18. g4 {At this point I finally abandoned thoughts of Q-side operations, in favour of K-side pressure, beginning with a general advance of the K-side pawns.} Rfe8 19. f5 Bc8 {(?!) As it turns out, it will take a long time for the bishop to get off this square.  Hindsight suggested that the bishop might have been better going to d7.  Possibly Black decided that the bishop would be too vulnerable there.} 20. f4 Qb6 {Aiming at the two weak points in White's position: b2 and, especially, d4.  The White queen once again has to take up guard duties.} 21. Qf2 {Guarding d4 and b2, both, and getting off the e-file to unpin the e5-knight.} Nfe4 {Had to come, of course, and this time, there is no pawn to lever the knight out of the e4-outpost - especially as there is a reserve knight available.  There is developing quite a clash of minor pieces in the centre.} 22. Nxe4 {(!)  I thought long and hard about whether to take with bishop or knight, it not being so very obvious whether the bishop would have much of a future remaining on the board.  After 22.Bxe4 dxe4 23.Na4 Qb3 24.Nc5 ... looks promising, but after 24...Qd5 25.Na4 Qb3 White seems to have nothing better than 26.Nc5 again - a draw by repetition.  That was enough to decide the issue.} dxe4 {Instead, 22...Nxe4 23.Bxe4 dxe4 24.Rfe1 f6 25.Nc4 Qd8 26.Rcd1 ... and Black might have trouble getting the Q-side sorted out.} 23. Bb1 {There was really nowhere else to go.  But now the square a2 and its accompanying diagonal to g8 is beckoning!} f6 {Weakening - but how else was Black to rid herself of the incubus at e5?} 24. Ba2+ {Zwischenzug!  Places the Bishop on the diagonal with a gain of tempo.} Kh7 {It is hard to tell whether the King would be safer on this square, or on h8.  } 25. Rc5 {Blocking the Black Queen's line to the d-pawn.  The alternative 25.Re1 also suggested itself, but I much preferred the text as offering the more security to the centre - which is not what you would call rock solid.  But what about the knight, 'en prise' at e5?  Yes: it was to be sacrificed.} fxe5 {This is an example of a passive sacrifice, and a positional sacrifice into the bargain.  White gets quite a lot of benefits from the knight's noble self-sacrifice.} 26. fxe5 {Of course not 26.Rxe5??  But look at that phalanx of pawns stretching more than half way across the board, and exercising a powerful crimp on Black's game.    Black can scarcely return the sacrifice at d6, when White will simply grab exclusive control of the whole centre.} Nb5 {There was no other place for the knight to go.  Yet from b5, the beau chevalier does place some pressure on d4 - enough to constrain the White queen.  White chooses to drive it off.} 27. a4 Nc7 {There is that about this position that reminds me strongly of the games of former World Champion, Tigran Vartanovitch Petrosian:  restrain, constrict, besiege. Black has been forced back into a difficult, cramped position.  The knight is fortunate to find a reasonably good square on d5, but by then Black's lonely, isolated and surrounded pawn at e4 will have fallen.} 28. Qe3 {Offering Black the b-pawn in exchange for the one at e4.  Since the latter can not be defended anyway, the offer seems reasonable.  But why not 28.Qe2, to keep the b-pawn protected?  The answer would have been salutary: 28.Qe2?! Rxe5! In effect the c5-rook would be pinned, as after 29.Rxe5 Qxd4ch 30.... Qxe5 would have won two pawns.  White would have to grovel to retain any kind of edge: 29.a5! Qb4 30.Rc4 Qxa5 31.dxe5 Qxa2 32.Qxe4.  The retention of most of the pawn centre would probably have offset the rook for two minor pieces material deficit, but I preferred to keep the g1-a7 diagonal firmly closed.} Nd5 {Centralising the knight.  An alternative plan might have been to return the piece now, by 28...Ne6 29.fxe6 Bxe6 But White's attack would have gained momentum: 30.Qxe4ch Kh8 31.Bb1 Bg8 32.g5! ... with the idea 32...hxg5?? 33.Qg6 and a forced mate.  Another plan might have involved 28...Qxb2 29.Rf2 Nd5 30.Bxd5 Qb1ch 31.Rc1 Qd3 32.Qxd3 exd3 33.Bc4 ... with advantage to White.} 29. Qxe4 Nf6 {Exploiting the half-pin on the e-file.  This was not just to drive back the White queen, but to blockade the f-pawn from advancing with a discovered check.  For instance: 29...Qxb2 30.f6ch g6!? (30...Kh8 31.Bb1 Nxf6 32.Rxf6 and all sorts of horrors ensue) 31.Bxd5! cxd5 32.Rc7ch etc.  Black is defending very cleverly, considering her cramped position.} 30. Qd3 {I did consider 30.Qc2, to protect the b-pawn, but then concluded I would be quite happy for Black to take it.  There was no point in 30.Qf4, as Black plays 30...Nd5, though White can retain an edge after 31.Bxd5 cxd5 32.Rxd5 Qb3 33.Rd6 Qxh3 34.Rf3 ... But why give Black so much counter-play? } Qxb2 {There was nothing to be done about the knight, now, as after 30.Nd5 31.f6ch! yields White a powerful attack.  But maybe 30....Qd8 offered a stouter defence?  White would have had the pleasant choice between 31.exf6 and 31.Be6! with an edge and the initiative, but the outcome still remaining in doubt.} 31. Bf7 Rd8 {Once again, Black conjures up a counter-action, this time against that weak spot on d4.  } 32. Bg6+ Kh8 33. exf6 {Taking the knight at last.  Black's defences are starting to crumble.} gxf6 {Instead, 33...Rxd4 34.fxg7ch Kg8 (...Kxg7 gets the same response) 35.f6! with a mating attack (e.g. 35...Rxd3? 36.f7ch and mates).  Or 33...Qxd4 34.Qxd4 Rxd4 35.f7 Rd8 36.Re5 ... with a winning attack.} 34. Rd1 {'Think defence'.  White has to take time out to shore up the isolated d-pawn.  All this while, since move 19, Black has had no time to remobilise her Q-side.  Has she now?} Qb6 {She has not.  After 34....Bd7, 35.Qe3 would have been just about terminal, attacking h6 and e7 both.} 35. Qe3 {The mobility of the queen at its best: aiming for e7 and h6 at the same time.  If 35...Kg7, 36.Qe7ch settles the matter.} Qc7 {Places the queen on the vital second rank.  White is still having to fight for the win, every inch of the way.} 36. Qxh6+ Kg8 37. Rc3 {(!) Preparing to switch across to the e-file.  The d1-rook keeps things quiet on the d-file.  But retreat had a defensive purpose as well.  My cunning opponent's queen move to c7 had not only the defence of the second rank in view, but also ...Qg3ch to force a draw.  } Qg7 {Throws back White's leading assault column.  Clearly reinforcements will be needed to carry through this attack!} 38. Qh5 {(?!) I rather think now that 38.Qf4 might have been the stronger option, with something like this happening: 38.Qf4 Bd7 39.Rg3! b5 40.g5 - and a straight-up bayonet attack into the Black King's castle.} Rd5 {(?) Desperation.  At last Black's resolve cracks, but the position had already become beyond salvation.  I was expecting, here, 38....Qh8 39.Bf7ch Kg7 40.Qg6ch Kf8 41.Re3 with a winning edge.} 39. Re3 Bd7 {At last, the bishop lurches off its chuff - but much too late.  Instead, 39...Be6 would have been marginally better, but who wants to give up material in a position already desperate?} 40. Rde1 {Look at all the White pieces focusing upon e8!  That kind of concentration of force is usually a sign that things are going pretty well.  In fact there was no reasonable cure for 41.Re7, so Black resigned without further ado.  Probably my best game of the Mini-T.}
