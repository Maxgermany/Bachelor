[Opening "King's pawn game (C44)"]

1. e4 {By the looks of the two ratings, black would be favored to win, but this game actually turned out to be quite the match. I started off with my traditional opening.} e5 2. Nf3 {I provoke the pawn.} Nc6 {He defends.} 3. d3 {Building up my defenses. } Nf6 4. a3 d5 {The battles begin.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Bg5 {Provoking the queen.} Be7 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. c4 {I tried to drive back the knight here.} Nf4 {He instead gets deeper into my territory.} 9. g3 {Again I try.} Nh3 {Again he goes in further. I didn't realize here I could take the knight for the price of my bishop.} 10. Qc2 {Instead I do a somewhat pointless move. } Bg4 11. Nbd2 {I defend my knight with my other knight.} O-O-O 12. Bxh3 {I finally take the knight...} Bxh3 {...for the price of my bishop of course.} 13. O-O-O {I defend my king. Defenses look alright for me.} Bg2 {He goes for the rook.} 14. Rhg1 {A no-brainer what he does next. This is when we really start battling.} Bxf3 15. Nxf3 Nd4 16. Nxd4 exd4 17. Rde1 Qf6 18. f4 {Before I battled this battle, I figured I'd have a big disadvantage by now, but instead, we are evenly match. It gets interesting here soon, but first...} Rhe8 {...the rooks battle.} 19. Qa4 Rxe1+ 20. Rxe1 a6 {Not the move I really expected.} 21. h4 {Probably not the move he expected. After I made this move, my opponent told me how I could of instead converged on space e8. If I had done that, it probably would of went this way:21. Re8 22. Rxe8 Qxe8+ 23. Qd8 Qxd7+ 24. Kxd7. Probably would of ended in a dead position eventually. Despite a missed opportunity, I quickly found an alternative.} c6 22. Qb4 {I start preparing for the attack.} Rd7 {Not the best move. Would of been better if he moved his queen to d6. He only made my attack easier.} 23. Qf8+ Kc7 {Would of been much better to move his rook to d8.} 24. Re8 {Now I'm in a fantastic position to attack the king.} h5 {?! I was quite puzzled with this move. He put me in a perfect position to attack, and that move didn't help his situation at all.} 25. Rc8+ {And now it has gotten interesting.} Kb6 26. Qb4+ Ka7 27. Qc5+ b6 {Forced move.} 28. Qf8 b5 {He attempts to create an opening for his king to escape.} 29. Ra8+ Kb6 30. Qc8 {Decided not to attack, for I did not want his king to escape.} Rb7 {He makes a good defensive move here, so I had to think carefully about my next move, but when I found it, black's fate was sealed.} 31. b4 {The king was now immobilized, unable to escape, thus black's options were limited, but he could still of found a way to avoid checkmate if he played his cards carefully, maybe by getting his Queen involved, but it would not of been easy. I would of kept fighting if I was him, but black does not see a way out and resigns, and thus this wonderful game was over. I hope you enjoyed my very first annotation! }
