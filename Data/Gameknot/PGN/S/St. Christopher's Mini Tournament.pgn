[Opening "Ruy Lopez (Spanish opening) (C60)"]

1. e4 {Good start  -  especially if you plan to play Ruy Lopez} e5 2. Nf3 {Develop with a threat - cuts down options for a reply} Nc6 3. Bb5 {Now we shape into Ruy Lopez - as planned} d5 {Think. If aggressive early moves like this are likely to achieve any divident, they would be part of every black defence against Ruy Lopez (your opening sequence).  If you play only Ruy Lopez, you will recognise any non standard move as odd/questionable/needs analysis straight away. As we look, we see 1. it leaves Nc6 exposed to pin 2. the N and e5 vulnerable to Nxe5 3. white is ready for 0-0 4. black needs 3 moves for 0-0} 4. O-O {Nxe5 immediately exploits d5  0-0 is not inherently bad it is just ... "  timing dear boy, timing" } Bd6 5. c3 {pxp exploits the pin, pressures the N, punishes the weak move, maintains the initiative. c3 makes little sense here, if you want to play d4 just play it, you don't need c3 to support. Remember, time and space can be as valuable as material, especially time.} dxe4 {It was your last 2 moves that gave away the time and space. 2 x "Get Out of Jail Free Cards"} 6. Ne1 {Now you see your position cramped and underdeveloped} Qg5 {Oh - an opportunity presents itself.} 7. d3 {d4 is better because Q must move and you have an option of d5 which pressures the already pinned N.} e3 8. Qe2 {Why not Bxe3 developing B with threat, now black has pxp  winning B } Bh3 9. Qxe3 {I prefer Bxe3 because of threat and development} Qxe3 10. fxe3 {It leaves B blocked in but the open f file is good} Bg4 11. Nf3 {The current sequence sees you getting back into position. I'd prefer quicker development } Nge7 12. e4 {These moves are ok and you are getting back into position - } O-O 13. Be3 a6 14. Ba4 b5 15. Bb3 {black has pushed your B onto a better square - f7 looks vulnerable now} b4 16. a3 {I'm not clear what this is about. Keep developing - you could recapture with b2  - if you are worried about the advancing p - play c4 (which threatens c5, winning the B, unless the Ne7 makes room, which allows Bd5, etc. etc.} a5 17. a4 Rad8 18. Nbd2 {at last the N gets going - and connects Rs } h6 19. Nh4 {N on the edge is not effective - were you thinking Ng6 coming ? } Nc8 {Another opportunity knocks} 20. Nc4 {Ah no !  Why not Ng6 willing an exchange, maybe more} Be7 21. Bd1 {B on f7 diagonal is still a major asset - you should look at Ng6 and recover the piece with a pawn by Nc4xp disc   etc,} Bxd1 22. Raxd1 Bxh4 23. g3 Be7 {Piece gone - look forward and re-assess - where can you make progress - look at d4} 24. Nd2 {c4 was not the best N position but d2 is not better especially after Rxp} Rxd3 25. Rfe1 bxc3 26. Nc4 {now c4 again but worse off - After loosing the piece you needed to make a new plan. Even a bad plan is better than no plan. Plans help us to make "joined-up" moves, to achieve a better position, exploit a weakness, etc.  The last 3 moves show how important a plan can be.} Rxd1 27. Rxd1 c2 28. Rc1 Nb4 29. Ra1 Nd6 30. Nxa5 Nxe4 31. Nb3 c5 32. Rc1 {Another sequence that arrives back to Rc1 but in a worse position. Confirms by points about plans} c4 33. Nd2 Nxd2 34. Bxd2 e4 35. Bxb4 Bxb4 36. Rxc2 Rc8 37. b3 c3 38. Kf1 g5 39. g4 {not a good move, you dont have time for this, anyway pretty soon the extra piece will prove decisive} h5 40. gxh5 f5 41. Ke2 f4 42. Kd1 e3 43. Rg2 Be7 44. h4 f3 45. Rg1 c2+ 46.
