[Opening "Queen's pawn game, Chigorin variation (D02)"]

1. d4 {Queen's pawn opening. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Queen%27s_Pawn_Opening http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Pawn_Game  The only thing I really want to point out is that the initial pawn is protected by the queen, so there's no fear of an immediate attack against the pawn.} d5 {It's best to have a plan for developing your pieces to useful squares quickly.  The method both players use to do that is called the opening (I know that seems pretty basic).    Try to concentrate of moving one or both central pawns to the center (top of the hill), develop both knights and bishops, and castle by move 10.  That takes 7 moves, leaving 3 for defending or retreating if a piece was moved too far out.} 2. Nf3 {The most common 2nd move seems to be c4, which is the Queen's Gambit.  This move is passive, in that it defends a piece that's already defended and not attacked, but is a good development move in preparation for castling kingside.} Nc6 {Note that diagonal knights counter each other in the center.} 3. e3 {This opens up the light squared bishop, but confines the dark squared bishop.  It's still defensive, in that the d4 pawn is now defended 3 times and attacked once.  } Nf6 {The 3rd rank on the c and f files, followed by the 2nd rank on the d and e files, is the best development spots for the knights.  The edge of the board reduces the number of squares they can move do, which greatly decreases their influence and power.} 4. Bb5 {The 5th rank is usually a good place to develop a bishop because of the immediate pin on the knight.  Whether or not you end up exchanging the pieces is a matter of preference, but the pin is what is important.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_(chess)} e6 {Black should take immediate action to break the pin.  Recognizing, taking advantage of, and breaking pins are important skills to develop.  In this case, it's obvious that black wants castle, which would break the pin on the knight, but castling isn't fast enough...} 5. Nc3 {White should be looking at playing Ne5 to attack the pinned knight on c6.  That would force white to defend it again or risk losing material or a weakened pawn structure.} Bb4 {Black plays for a symmetrical position and pins white's knight.  Symmetrical positions tend to be better for the side with initiative (white at the beginning of the game).  This also opens up black's kingside for castling.} 6. Ne5 {Attacking the pinned knight.} O-O {Black castles to break the pin, but is a move too late.  Bd7 would have prevented any material loss, but white would then have the option of exchanging his knight for black's bishop.} 7. Nxc6 {White exchanges to win a pawn.} bxc6 8. Bxc6 Rb8 9. a3 {White tries to break the pin on his knight by forcing the bishop to retreat.  Bd2 would have been better, since an exchange wouldn't result in a weakened pawn structure.} Bxc3+ {Black exchanges rather than retreat.} 10. bxc3 {White's queenside pawn structure fragments.  Isolated and doubled pawns are usually considered weak.  Notice that no pawns can help support the a and c pawns on either side, so pieces must be used to defend them.    Also note the open b file.  Both sides want them for control of the board, but black has already claimed this one with his rook, which will make it difficult for white to use it.} Ne4 {Ba6 would have been better, since it would have prevented white from castling and cramped white on both sides of the board.  Move 10 is when both sides should have developed all minor pieces and castled.  Black is a little further along and has a couple small advantages at this point (rook posted on the b file and a centralized knight).} 11. O-O {c4 would have been a better move.  Black's d pawn is pinned to his knight, so he wouldn't be able to capture white's c pawn immediately, and white could untangle his doubled c pawns by exchanging one or both of them away.  If black decided to play 11...Nc3 anyway, 12. Qd3 would force Ne4, allowing 13. cxd5 exd5 14. c4, which forces Nf6 or wins a pawn.} Qf6 {Black seems to have an interesting plan here, but I don't see a way for him to do more than win white's f pawn.    I think Bd7 is better, since it would force the exchange of white's active bishop and allow black to push his c pawn forward, either tripling and isolating white's c pawns, or pushing it to c4, to further weaken white's c pawns.    Nxc3 is also an option if black wants to recover his pawn, but I think it's a wasted move.} 12. Qf3 {f3 is better.  It would protect the prevent black from capturing on f2, force black's knight to give up his outpost, and support an e pawn advance in a few moves.  It would slightly weaken the king on g3 and along the a7-g1 diagonal, but since black already gave up his dark squared bishop, it's a minimal risk.  If black responds with Nxc3, then 13. Qd3 wins the knight.} Ba6 {An interesting attack.  If white hadn't already defended his f2 pawn, this would have won it.  As it is, it hampers white a little and forces his rook to the e file, but if white could get rid of the knight on e4, then the e1 is where white's rook should be, to support his e pawn as it opens files for attacking.  It also links black's rooks, which would be good if he planned on doing anything with them.  I think Bb7 or Rb6 would both be slightly better.} 13. Qxf6 gxf6 {Nxf6 would have been better, because it would have left black's pawns intact.    As pieces come off the board, the king gets braver and braver.  With the closed position of the board and queens gone, there's no reason that black's king needs to hide in the corner, but protected pawns may be important later, during the endgame.} 14. f3 {White gets tired of black's knight dominating the center of the board.} Nxc3 {Bxf1 would have been better, but would have given white his choice of pieces to capture in exchange.  Black elected to save his knight and pick up a tasty snack on c3, which evens material.} 15. Re1 Ne2+ {This is a wasted move.  The knight can't do any real harm and has nowhere to no other than back to c3.  An exchange for the bishop would link white's rooks and get rid of white's weak bishop on black's time.} 16. Kf1 {? - Bad move.    Kf2 would move the king toward the center, but most importantly, it would prevent the discovered attack from white's bishop.} Nc3+ {A better move is Nxd4  (discovered check), then followed it up with Nxc6.  Another option is Nxc1 , followed by Ne2, which may lead to 18. Rxe2 Bxe2 19. Kxe2, winning a rook and bishop for bishop and knight, but that gains less material as well as leaving white's active bishop in play.} 17. Kf2 Bb5 18. Bb2 Na4 19. Bxb5 Nxb2 {Rxb5 is better.  It leave white with a passive bishop under attack by the knight and rook as well as "lift" black's rook and allow his 2nd one to link on the b file.} 20. a4 Rfc8 21. Bd3 Nxd3+ 22. cxd3 {White's pawns are doubled again, but this time, the 2nd pawn actually strengthens white's center.  He could either trade his d4 pawn if black pushed his c pawn and still maintain a pawn front on the d and e files, or support his e pawn during a push forward.  At this point, both positions are almost identical.  Black's rook on the b file is easily countered and the differences in pawn structure are almost negligible.} Kg7 23. e4 Rcd8 {Black should push his c pawn to exchange it, since it's backwards (on a half open file and behind the adjacent pawn).  Backwards pawns can be difficult to defend and should be exchanged or pushed forward if possible.} 24. Rec1 Rdc8 25. Rc6 {This prevents black from pushing his pawn and binds black's rooks to defending it.  White } dxe4 26. dxe4 f5 27. Rac1 Rb7 28. a5 fxe4 29. fxe4 Rb4 30. Rc6xc7 {Ke3 would have defended white's pawns better, though black could have played for a draw by alternating checks and attacks on white pawns.} Rxc7 31. Rxc7 Rxd4 32. Ke3 Ra4 33. Rxa7 Kg6 {White should keep his rook on the a file and try to advance that pawn to queen.  It's difficult to move the rook out of the way, but with black's king on the 2nd rank, it's possible.  Something like: 34. Ra8 f6 35. a6 e5 36. a7 Ra3  37. Kf2 Ra4 38. Rg8  Kh6 39. a8=Q Rxa8 40. Rxa8	} 34. Kf4 {White tries to prevent black's pawns from moving, but allowing the e pawn to be pinned is a bad idea.  It would be better to advance his g and h pawns.} f6 {c5, taking advantage of white's pinned pawn, would have been better.} 35. Re7 e5+ 36. Kf3 Rxa5 {Positions are almost equal again, though white's single e pawn leaves him slightly weaker.  This game should draw barring any blunders.} 37. g4 h5 38. h3 f5 39. gxf5+ {exf5  is slightly better, since it would link all 3 pawns.  Black's passed e pawn could be problematic if white gets careless, but the risk is minor compared to the safety gained with protected pawns.} Kf6 40. Re8 {Re6 is better, since it forces black's king to retreat or advance to g5, where things get confined and scary.  Note that black's pawns form a barrier that white's king has trouble passing.} Ra3+ {White can't hold onto both his h and e pawns.} 41. Kg2 Re3 42. Rh8 Kg7 43. Rxh5 Rxe4 44. Kf3 Rf4+ 45. Ke3 Kf6 46. Kd3 Rxf5 47. Rh8 Rf4 48. h4 Kg7 49. Rh5 Kf6 50. Ke3 Ke6 51. Rh6+ Rf6 52. Rxf6+ Kxf6 53. Kf3 {1/2-1/2}
