1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nc4 {The first deviation from "book". I was expecting the usual retreat of N-KB3.} Nxe4 {I play the book move and recapture the Pawn.} 5. d3 Nf6 6. Qe2+ {This move blocks my bro's K-side development, locking in the KB.} Be7 7. g3 Bg4 {Instead of castling at once, I aim to provoke a weakness in my bro's K-side. I anticipate he'll fianchetto his B and castle there.} 8. f3 Be6 {Having induced a Pawn weakness, I retreat my B to the square I intended to place it on all along.} 9. Nc3 O-O {Now I need to finish my Q-side development.} 10. Bd2 Nc6 11. O-O-O {With his K-side weakened, my brother wisely chooses to castle on the Q-side. } Nd4 12. Qe3 c5 {I now have my Knight situated on a solidified central outpost.} 13. Ne4 {My brother wants an equally good outpost for his own Knight...} Nxe4 {...which I of course prevent...} 14. Qxe4 {...but he ends up with a beautifully centralized Queen.} b5 {I aim to drive his Knight...} 15. Ba5 {...but he counterattacks instead of retreating.} Bf5 {I plunged into the complications without fully calculating them, figuring I could find a way to come out ahead. However, my confidence was misplaced.} 16. Bxd8 {The tactical sequence is initiated.} Bxe4 {This response is forced.} 17. Bxe7 {I had figured on 17 QPxB BxB, keeping the material even. This move shocked me.} Bxf3 {With my Rook under attack, this move is forced.} 18. Bxf8 {With two pieces en prise, my brother cannot maintain the advantage of a piece. However, he will emerge a Pawn ahaead in the ensuing endgame.} Bxh1 {Now I have to be careful not to have this Bishop trapped.} 19. Bxd6 {The move that ends up giving my brother the advantage he needs to win.} bxc4 20. Bxc5 {Now he is ahead a Pawn in a position where that advantage has significance.} Nf3 {If now 21 PxP, 21... NxP and I remain only a single Pawn behind.} 21. h3 cxd3 22. Bxd3 {With my King behind the wall of Pawns, i have to be alert for the possibility of a back rank mate. My Rook must stay on the first rank for the moment.} Bg2 23. Be4 Re8 24. Bxf3 {My brother chooses to simplify further. While this accentuates the Pawn edge, I do maintain some drawing chances because of the opposite colored Bishops.} Bxf3 25. Rg1 Bd5 26. Bxa7 Bxa2 {The more Pawns come off the board, the better my chances of salvaging a draw.} 27. c3 {If he had played P-N3, I would have been forced to play ...R-R1 to save my B.} Bb3 {Instead, I'm able to effectively immobilise his Q-side Pawns with this move.} 28. Bd4 Re2 {Now his King is confined to the first rank. I considered playing ...P-R3 here, to be followed by ...P-B3 and shifting my K back and forth on the white squares, but rejected the plan as too limiting. In retrospect, it may well have been best to force my bro to try to make progress with his King trapped behind the lines. } 29. h4 f5 {Neglecting the first rule of endgames: the player with a disadvantage should keep the game closed, not open it up.} 30. g4 f4 {Creating a passed Pawn, but it proves useless.} 31. Rf1 Rh2 {Intending ...RxP in response to RxP.} 32. h5 g6 {Now anticipating 33 RxP PxP 34 PxP RxP.} 33. hxg6 {With this alteration in move order, my brother takes a commanding 2 Pawn lead in material.} hxg6 34. Rxf4 {I could easily resign now, but with OCB's still on the board, I decide to fight on a bit longer.} Rg2 35. Be3 Be6 {Another mistake. Now his Q-side Pawns are free to advance.} 36. Rf6 Bf7 37. g5 Re2 38. Bd4 Re6 {Now I free his King, and it's just a matter of time and technique.} 39. b4 Re7 40. Kc2 Kh7 41. Kd3 Be6 42. b5 Bf5+ 43. Kc4 Rc7+ {Still hoping to force an error and win back at least one Pawn in a position where I could salvage a draw.} 44. Kb4 Bd3 45. Ka5 Rd7 46. b6 Be4 {Trying to prevent the Pawn from forcing its way through.} 47. Re6 Bb7 48. c4 Rxd4 49. Re7+ Kg8 50. Rxb7 {With the removal of the OCB's, it's all over but the shouting.} Rxc4 51. Rb8+ Kf7 52. b7 Rc7 53. Kb6 {My king can't get to the Q-side in time to stop the Pawn from Queening. So I resign. Not my best played game. Well done, bro, for exploiting my mistakes and getting a win!}
