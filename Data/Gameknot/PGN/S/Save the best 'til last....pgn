[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 {I've chosen to annotate this game because of the strong endgame play that transpires. I hope it might give some players tips on how to play endgames, and maybe stronger players can find a mistake that Black should capitalise on for the win.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez opening - an opening that I play against a lot, and feel comfortable to do so.} a6 {The most popular reply to 3. Bb5, forcing the bishop to do something.} 4. Bxc6 {This move annoys me - Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation. My experience is that it is played by lower ranked players to try and lull into a drawn game by swapping all material. In my personal database, five games have followed this line and the average rating of my opponent was 1515. The more popular 4. Ba4 has an average rating of 1639 in my personal database.  I should probably say this is my personal experience and I do not mean to insult anyone that chooses to play it.   All that being said, I'm happy to play against it. I think my endgame is reasonably strong and the quicker we get there, the better.} dxc6 {Move favourable for Black because it opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the LSB and half-opens the d-file for the Queen to get out quickly. 4. bxc6 is weaker in my opinion. I don't think Black can benefit from that open b-file, and the LSB on b7 is not great due to the half-open file and the pawn on c6 blocking its a8-h1 diagonal.} 5. d4 {This is called the Ruy Lopez Exchange Alekhine variation, apparently.} exd4 {I can't see much choice for Black but to accept the pawn, it'll cause him too many problems in the centre.} 6. Qxd4 {This seems really negative, too, from White. With the open (and White-controlled) centre, Black's lack of development so far, Black's inability to castle quickly and White able to quickly call up more pieces, I feel that Black's only real option again is to swap Queens.  I've felt forced into many of these moves so far.} Qxd4 7. Nxd4 Bd7 {Finally Black has time to make a move. The LSB has very few safe squares with the current state of the board but I want to move it so I can castle on the queen-side. This is the quickest side to castle and get my king to safety, but also puts my rook quickly onto the open d-file.} 8. Nc3 {White develops naturally - provides later support to d1.} O-O-O {King to safety and bishop waiting to reveal an attack to the knight on d4.} 9. Be3 {Defending and developing in one movement.} Bb4 {I wanted to develop the DSB before the knight but had to choose where. c5 is a bad square because of 10. Nxc6. Putting my bishop on e7 was far too passive. d6 might have been a good choice but seeing as I've looked to seize the d-file, I didn't want to block it in again. With 9. Bb4, I'm pinning the knight and threatening to double White's pawns.} 10. Nde2 {Re-positions his d4 knight and defends his c3 knight, stopping me from doubling pawns on the c-file. The half-open b-file would probably have helped White anyway, so I probably wouldn't have done so. } Nf6 11. O-O-O {This is the first inaccuracy that pops up on GameKnot analysis, but it doesn't look too bad. It recommends 11. a3.} Rhe8 {GK computer analysis considered that I should have continued with 11. O-O-O Ng4 12. Rd3 Nxe3 13. Rxe3 Be6 14. Rg3 g6 15. f4 Bc5 16. Rd3 Bc4 17. Rdd1 Rhe8 18. e5 Be3+ 19. Kb1 h6. As it is, I chose to threaten to win the e4 pawn.} 12. f3 {Defends the pawn and limits the squares of my LSB.} Be6 {Trying to position my LSB to be more useful in the game and opening the d-file.} 13. Rxd8+ Rxd8 {I should have expected him to exchange given the choice of opening moves.} 14. Rd1 {White moves his rook to challenge the d-file, but I also know that he is looking to exchange the rooks. White offers a draw here, which I refuse.} Rxd1+ {I decide not to give Black the chance and take the initiative. I'm looking to whittle down White's pieces now and try and outplay him in the endgame.} 15. Kxd1 Kd7 {Trying to get my king to the middle of the board, I'm happy to do so because I think it won't be long before White offers to swap more pieces.} 16. a3 {Only two moves later, White offers me another draw here. I had seen from White's move selection and willingness to exchange everything that he was playing for a draw from the beginning of the game. It is disappointing but I guess that is my opponents choice.  I must admit, I was a little disgruntled by his nerve to offer another draw such a short time after I refused it. I chose to continue on again.} Bd6 17. Nd4 {White makes a mistake in leaving his h2 pawn under attack. It is clear to me that 16. a3 was a means to release his knight on e2 in another attempt to exchange pieces. I want to keep it, but I've been offered a free pawn and it doesn't have many safety squares.} Bxh2 18. Nxe6 {My opponent takes another chance to exchange pieces.} Kxe6 {Keeping the three pawns connected and puts my king closer to the middle of the board.} 19. Ke2 h6 {Stopping the bishop coming to g5 because I'm sure it won't stop to arrive there and exchange if I let it.} 20. Kf2 Bd6 {I think this was a mistake. Given my extra pawn and my opponents reluctance to allow double pawns going into the endgame, 20. Be5 would probably have forced him to play 20... Nd1.} 21. Ne2 c5 22. c4 c6 23. Bf4 {Asking for another exchange and, again, I can't find a better place for it. I'm not willing to give his knight a tempo check though so I threaten his pawn and force him to make the move.} Be5 24. Bxe5 Kxe5 {And the endgame really begins... As it is hard to force a knight exchange, I can keep that and try to see if I can make anything from my pawn advantage (albeit with double pawns), or see if my opponent has any endgame weaknesses. I've got my king into the centre which is important, but also dangerous with the knight around.} 25. Ke3 {I just want to make a brief notation on endgames with knights that I have learnt from experience. It may seem obvious but knowing the mechanics of the knight is important. Endgames with rooks and bishops are easier than knights because the movements of those pieces are a lot easier to predict (a LSB bishop isn't going to be able to use dark squares, etc.).  A knight is much more complex; Firstly, a knight cannot lose a tempo. I think it is VERY important to realise how long it takes a knight to maneuver from one square to another. For example, to get my knight from f6 to d4, it will take a MINIMUM of 4 moves (eg. Ne8-c7-e6-d4).   Finally, endgames with knights require players to be careful where the kings are placed because with a tempo check, the knight can quickly make it's way to tackle a lot of squares. The knight would be attacking a third movement square very quickly. If you consider a knight in the centre (d4, d5, e4 or e5), I believe the knight almost makes every square on the board in three moves.} Ne8 {Probably a bad place to place my knight in the endgame, but I'm looking to move it to d6 and attack the squares at f5 and c4.} 26. f4+ Ke6 {Forced back to the sixth rank by the pawn.} 27. Nc3 Nd6 28. Kd3 b5 {I have my knight on d6 and I play my pawn to b5 offering white to un-double my pawns, but also stopping the white knight from travelling to a4.} 29. b3 {The pawn needed defending as it obviously couldn't be taken either. I feel I've put some weakness into White's queen-side, especially at c4.} g5 {Now I'm trying to attack the king-side and stretch white's defences - I'm looking to disconnect his pawns. White could try the check with f5 but that gives me two connected pawns against one... that would require urgent attention from black and could allow me in (as my knight and king would be attacking the e4 pawn). From here, it is still very much heading for a drawn game.} 30. e5 Nf5 31. fxg5 {31... Kxe5 32. gxh6 Nxh6 wins a pawn momentarily, but I can't defend c5 after 33. Ne4. Then my knight would be out on the side and I don't want it there, away from the action.} hxg5 32. Ne4 Kxe5 {I offered White a draw here, but he turned it down, obviously thinking that he had gained an advantage from his knight position. GameKnot computer analysis has me at +1.44 in this situation.} 33. Nxg5 {I didn't expect this, if I'm honest. I thought he might play Nxc5 and look to get rid of my pawns on that side. If he had, I was going to continue with Nh4 and look to remove White's pawn and then worry about defending the queen-side.} Nd6 {The White knight is away from it's king and with Nd6 I've restricted the moves his knight can make. 34. Nf3+ provides a check, but only allows me to move closer to that unprotected g-pawn with Kf4. 34. Ke3 leaves c4 unprotected. White is struggling for moves here and needs to bring his knight back to the queen side.} 34. Nh7 Ne4 {As Black, I'm looking to restrict the movement of White's knight and hopefully use it's lack of mobility to my advantage. It's only 'safe' square is f8, which is actually a trap that I'd seen as a possibility just after White turned down the draw.} 35. Nf8 {White tries to make roads into the queen-side.... but Black has other ideas.} Nf6 {With 35. Nf6, Black has trapped the White knight so it has no escape squares - Black now feels he has an advantage in the endgame and will look to capitalise on it. One further mistake from White will cost him dearly.} 36. Ke3 {Stopping the Black King from penetrating either side.} a5 {Trying to move my pawns further up the board and waste time to see if White will move his king. The further up the board my pawns are, the better chance I have of promoting them.} 37. a4 {Reacting to my pawn push and blocking them in - if I get my pawn to a4 then picking off c4-pawn followed by a3-pawn with my knight would be easy.} bxa4 {37... b4 would have wasted time, but White could have followed suit with 38. g3 and I'm still forced to play, and white's pawns are harder to attack.} 38. bxa4 Kd6 {Going down for the knight.} 39. Kf4 {Following, as it has to or White loses his knight. White cannot afford this lose because my knight will have no problem guiding a pawn to promotion.} Ke7 40. Kf5 {From here, 40... Kxf8 41. Kxf6 is clearly stalemate. Black would not benefit from an exchange on d7 - so he places his knight on e8 and White will save his knight by moving to h7, it's only available square. An interesting line might have been 40... Ng8!? 41. Nh7 f6 42. Kg6 Ke6... I didn't see it at the time, and it looks decent as Black can regain the pawn and get the king in a good position. However, he does allow White a passed pawn.} Ne8 41. Nh7 Nd6+ {Tempo check to gain time and win a pawn.} 42. Ke5 {Allows me to take the pawn and give another check - maybe Kf4 was marginally better? It moves away from my pawns, but gives him time to release his knight.} Nxc4+ 43. Ke4 f6 {Again, using the pawn to restrict White's knight and gain a move on the queen-side.} 44. g4 Nb2 45. g5 {White has sacrificed his last pawn to release his knight from the trap it has been encased in for 10 moves now. Is that enough of an advantage for Black? Note also that I'm aware that once the knight takes on g5, the king is in the worst place possible for it to gain time.} fxg5 46. Nxg5 Nxa4 {Black eliminates the White pawns - has at least a draw!} 47. Ke5 {GK analysis calls this another inaccuracy, but the problem I have later in the game is my inability to get my king past the White king. } c4 48. Nf3 {Ne4 would allow Black to push the pawn to c2, if he wished.} Kd7 49. Kd4 Nb6 50. Kc5 {Attacking two pawns and my knight while restricting my king's movement.} c3 {A blunder - GK analysis shows that 50... c3 51. Kxb6 c2 52. Ne5+ Kd6 53. Nd3 gives White an easy draw. It was intended to scare the knight to d4 because the king cannot catch the pawn. A simple Kc7 looks better now.} 51. Nd4 Kc7 52. Ne6+ Kb7 53. Nd4 {The knight has to move back to protect c2.} a4 54. Kb4 Nd5+ {Another idea I had is 54... c5+ 55. Kxc5 (forced!) a3 56. Nc2 a2 57. Kb4 Nd5+ 58. Kb3 Ne3 59. Na1 c2 60. Nxc2 Nxc2 61 Kxa2... which is a draw.} 55. Kxa4 c5 56. Nc2 Nb4 {I'm trying any ploy possible to get White to make a mistake. Nxb4 would be a blunder as it gives me connected pawns. A movement from the knight, like Na3 might have allowed my king to come around the back of the pawns and help them. Even if you didn't have much idea about endgames, I think Kb3 stands out here.} 57. Kb3 {57... Kc6 58. Kxc3 Nxc2 59. Kxc2 Kd5 60. Kd3 (or 59... Kb5 60. Kb3), which is against a draw at best play.} Nd5 58. Na3 {Moving the knight to attack the c3 pawn.} Kc6 59. Nb1 c4+ {My really last ditch attempt... if Kxc4, Black promotes the c3 pawn.} 60. Kc2 Kc5 61. Nxc3 Nxc3 {With only one pawn, white can just sacrifice his knight to take the solo pawn and get a draw. I get rid of the knight to test my opponent, keep him honest and see he can force a draw with his king ahead of the pawn.} 62. Kxc3 Kd5 63. Kc2 Kd4 64. Kd2 c3+ {To be able to promote this pawn, I need White to give up the opposition to me. That means, that I must get move my Black king opposite the White king (two squares below), thus forcing the White king to move. This can be avoided here if White plays between c1 and c2. If the Black king moves to d3, White should follow to d1. If the Black king moves to b3, White should move to b1.} 65. Kc1 Kc4 66. Kc2 Kd4 67. Kc1 c2 68. Kxc2 {My opponent doesn't give it up and the game ends in a draw; I decide to throw my pawn at him in a strange sign of respect! Plus I didn't feel I wanted to offer another draw after three were rejected in the game.  It was a boring game made interesting by a nice knight trap and strong endgame play, in my opinion.  I hope you all enjoy it and don't mind the excessive annotations I have put all over it.}
