1. e4 {This was a fun blitz game I played some time ago and I happened to grab the pgn, so you guys get to enjoy it! Please bear in mind that this was five-minute blitz--poor decisions were made on both sides. I stick to a book I'm familiar with, since there's time pressure to consider, and we get into a very delicate Sicilian with a lot of action all across the board, finally culminating in a frightening sequence of missed opportunities as our clocks run out.} c5 {Black obliges me with the Sicilian.} 2. d4 {I prefer open positions in time pressure, so I go straight for it.} cxd4 3. Qxd4 {2. d4 gives me the psychological advantage (or so I like to think) of being able to play this move. It would be risky to keep the Queen out so early, of course, but I think the aggressive posture was worth the tempo.} Nc6 {Developing with tempo.} 4. Qd1 {I'm behind a little in development but I'm confident in my ability to catch up. Black still has pawns to move before he can get his Bishops out. I considered playing 4. Qa4 briefly, but decided to err on the side of caution.} Qc7 {The intent behind this move isn't particularly clear to me. It doesn't threaten anything in particular and doesn't help Black get his Bishops developed. Perhaps my early Queen action is already provoking my opponent into rash behavior.} 5. c4 {Black is giving me a chance to constrict his position, so I jump on it. This move has the additional benefit of preventing ...Nb5 from being any kind of threat (aiming at c2). I think 5. f4 would have been strong here as well.} e6 {Freeing the Bishop and preparing for an eventual ...d5.} 6. Nf3 {I need to get on with my development before I fall inextricably far behind.} b6 {Black plans to fianchetto his LSB while giving the half-open c file to his Rook and Queen.} 7. a3 {? This was not the best choice; continuing my development with 7. Be2 or 7. Be3 would have been fine. The text avoids the potential for isolated, doubled c-pawns, but that probably wasn't a realistic concern.} Bb7 {Logical.} 8. Nc3 {Continuing to develop while defending the e-pawn.} a6 {Black prevents Nb5, which would drive his Queen from c7, but I can't really afford to be running my pieces all around yet anyway.} 9. Be3 {Continuing to develop as fast as I can, as well as putting pressure on the b6 pawn.} Bc5 {Black offers a trade and starts preparing to castle.} 10. Be2 {This isn't the best place for my Bishop in the long run, but under the circumstances I like this move. I allow Black to double my e-pawns at the cost of his Bishop, but I'm now ready to castle into a very safe spot and I have my sights set on e5 and Black's d-pawn.} Bxe3 11. fxe3 {Doubles the pawns, but now my Rook will have a nice half-open file to work on.} Nge7 {I don't see a reason for Black to avoid 11...Nf6 here unless he's planning ...f5.} 12. O-O O-O 13. Qd2 {Connecting my Rooks and defending the weak e3 pawn from any enterprising Knights coming to c4 (after ...Na5 and ...b5) or f5 (after ...f5).} Ng6 {This seems like a strange spot to me. At e7, the Knight supported important pawn advances to d5 and f5. On g6, it's fairly inactive.} 14. Rad1 {My development is finished only just before Black's, but my forces are in a much more aggressive position. I just have to be careful not to slip up and let his Queen and Bishop come into play.} Rad8 {This is a fine move; 14...Nce5 might have been more interesting though, defending the d-pawn and discovering attacks on my c- and e-pawns.} 15. Ng5 {Black has several pieces trapped on the queenside, so I want to take advantage of that if I can, and ideally stuff them in further. I have visions of trading off my Bishop for his kingside Knight and then somehow maneuvering a Knight of my own to d5 (after provoking ...e5 somehow), which should give me a strong attack while keeping most of his pieces out of the picture.} d6 {I couldn't have been happier about this move. Black announces his intention to play ...e5, and blocks the Queen from her diagonal. I think he was worried about a Rook sacrifice on f7, which, to be fair, I was eying somewhat hungrily.} 16. Bh5 {I threaten to double Black's pawns and eliminate a critical defender.} Nce5 {Again worrying about the mounting pressure at f7 if he played 16...Nge5. I don't think it's in real danger at this point, but the text move does at least bring another piece over to where the action is, and produce a couple of threats that I have to deal with.} 17. b3 {This reinforcement is simple enough, but how am I going to coax the Black Knight away from e5?} Bc8 {My pawn on e4 is unassailable at the moment (note that 17...f5 loses to 18. Nxe6, winning material and shattering Black's position) and ...d5 is impossible, so Black abandons the long diagonal in favor of consolidating his Kingside.} 18. Nf3 {I attack the Knight the only way I can.} Nc6 {...And he obligingly retreats. Had the Knight remained, I probably would have played 19. Nxe5, hoping for 19...dxe5 20. Qf2 Rxd1 21. Nxd1, with a fair attack on f7 and Black's Bishop hopelessly stuffed by his own pawns.} 19. Bxg6 {Trading off the defender.} fxg6 {19...hxg6 might have been stronger, with a quick ...f5 to follow up.} 20. Ng5 {My Knight's work finished at f3, he returns to g5 to tie down the Bishop to defending e6.} Ne5 {Black's Knight also resumes his former position. Now I need a plan to get him off that square *and* to convince Black to play ...e5 instead.} 21. Ne2 {This Knight starts a long journey, looking at d5 the whole time.} h6 {This weakens g6 and makes my next move look like a retreat, which is fine by me. To be fair, I don't see anything else that's much better, but 21...Qc6 is worth a look.} 22. Nf3 {Inviting this trade again.} Nf7 {And Black denies it again, this time stifling his Rook but giving him a better array of possible positions to relocate to.} 23. Ned4 {This Knight is going to d5, remember. This attack on e6 is the perfect tool to convince Black to finally play ...e5. The original plan was to bring this Knight to f4 instead, but since Black advanced the h-pawn, 23. Nf4 is met with 23...g5, which doesn't further my goal at all.} e5 {Another possible option is 23...d5, but I think that fails against 24. Nxe6! Bxe6 25. exd4, and my passed pawns should be plenty of compensation for the Knight.} 24. Ne2 {I pull back again. I can almost taste d5 and the subsequent attack.} Bg4 {My Knight here really has no options--if he wants to take it, that's fine by me. 24...Bb7 doesn't fare much better (24...Bb7 25. Nc6 followed by 26. Nd5), but maybe 24...g5 would make me stop to think.} 25. Nc3 Bxf3 {Black trades a Bishop that could have been useful for a Knight with no prospects and lets me lift my Rook in the process. He's trying to trade down to lessen the pressure, but he has no way to get at the pieces that actually matter. 25...Qc5 might have been a good alternative here.} 26. Rxf3 Qc6 {A meaningless threat. Again, I think the Queen would be better positioned on c5.} 27. Nd5 {Finally! From here, my Knight is untouchable, and thanks to Black's last move, now I threaten a family fork at e7.} Rde8 {Practically forced. If 27...Rd7, I can pile up on the f file with a devastating pin on the f7 Knight.} 28. Qf2 {? With my Knight comfortably entrenched at d5, I shift my focus to Black's castle. Looking back on it, 28. Rf1 might have been a better choice, since the Queen move loses me the f-file after 28...Ng5 29. Rxf8 Rxf8 and suddenly I don't have an attack any more.} Qb7 {? Defending the f7 Knight, though again I think just playing 28...Ng5 outright is much stronger here.} 29. Rf1 {Now it's too late for Black to play ...Ng5.} g5 {Black's Knight can't move anyway, so I guess there are worse moves than this. I think trying to divert my attention to the queenside with 29...b5 might be stronger (though after 30. cxb5 axb5 (not 30...Qxb5? 31. Rxf7 Qxf1+ 32. Qxf1 Rxf7, although this line is interesting it still loses for Black), Black is still hard-pressed to continue with any sort of attack).} 30. h3 {Preventing ...g4, not because it's really a threat (30...g4 31. Rf5 g6 32. Rf6 and I proceed to tear Black's position apart) but because I'm pretty much waiting Black out--he's under serious time pressure and I'm expecting him to make a mistake.} b5 {No reason this couldn't have happened last move.} 31. Qe2 {? I crack first after all. I didn't notice at the time that after 31. cxb5 Qxb5 I win Black's f7 Knight and the game, so my Queen is drawn out of her battery.} bxc4 32. Qxc4 {My Queen has been lured to the other side of the board, but at least from here I can still pressure Black's Knight and King.} Qb5 {?! Black offers an exchange of Queens in an attempt to diffuse my attack.} 33. Qc3 {I'm reluctant to give up my Queen so I miss the alternate line 33. Nc7 Qxc4 34. bxc4 Re7 (34...Rc8 35. Ne6 Rfe8 36. Nxg7 Kxg7 37. Rxf7+) 35. Nxa6 Ra7 36. Nb4 Rxa3 37. Rd1, which looks drawish to me unless one of us slips.} Qc5 {Asking for the trade again, this time with another threat as well.} 34. Qd3 {I give him the a3 pawn, assuming I'll be able to recoup it sooner or later and hoping he'll advance his a-pawn with the intent to queen it, letting my Queen slip in behind the lines.} Qxa3 35. g4 {I'm looking for a way to get my Queen to a7 now, so first I lock up Black's kingside in an attempt to get him to push ...a5.} a5 {I think 35...Rb8 or 35...Ra8 would have been stronger here. Black cannot allow my Queen onto his back ranks (as will become clear shortly).} 36. Qa6 {This is just where I want to be, behind enemy lines and sheltered from Black's Queen.} Qxb3 {The Queen keeps gobbling pawns, assuming the forces arrayed around her King will be sufficient to protect him.} 37. Qa7 {I don't need to take the a-pawn; I can do that at my leisure. Right now I have the advantage of Black's Queen being stuck on the wrong side of the board, so I'm going to use it.} Nd8 {? This move hangs a Rook, but Black doesn't have a lot of options. 37...Qb8 is a little better, but still loses to 38. Rxf7.} 38. Rf3xf8+ {This Rook looks defended well enough, but thanks to the most excellent Knight in the game, it turns out not to be.} Rxf8 {The only move. 38...Kh7 is met with 39. Nf6+ Kg6 40. Nxe8 Ne6 (to prevent mate on g7) 41. R8f6+ Kh7 (41...gxf6 42. Rxf6#) 42. Rxe6 and Black is done for.} 39. Ne7+ {Winning the Rook.} Kh7 40. Rxf8 Ne6 {Not only is this the Knight's only safe square, but it also defends g7 and tells the White Rook to shove off. It's not good enough, though.} 41. Nf5 {?? I think my Rook is safe because of the mate threat, but this move leads to needless complications and gives Black a chance at a draw. There's a forced mate in five starting with 41. Rh8+ that I completely missed.} Qb1+ {Black begins to throw checks around, in the hopes of catching me in a perpetual check or winning back enough material to get back in the game, now that my Knight is blocking my Rook from interposing.} 42. Kf2 Qxe4 {? Black might have caught me in a draw with 42...Qc2+ 43. Kf3 Qd1+ 44. Kf2 Qd2+ etc. White can play 43. Kg3 and avoid it, but under time pressure I probably would have opted for defending the e4 pawn, and given up the draw.} 43. Nxd6 {I had entirely forgotten about my Rook at this point, so I allow Black a combination that lets him back in the game.} Qc2+ {Moving the Queen out of harm's way--with check.} 44. Kg3 Nxf8 {Taking back the rook and a strong position.} 45. Qf7 {? I think 45. Nf5 is a little better, but it's still probably not good enough to win after 45...Ne6 46. Qxa5 e4 and Black should draw at least.} Ng6 {?? Black can afford to dump his Knight: 45...a4 46. Qxf8 Qc7 47. Nf5 Qa7 and the game should be a draw. The text move gives me a clear win:} 46. Nf5 {Black, having no choice but to sacrifice his Queen to avoid immediate checkmate, resigns. Thanks for the exciting game, ccheall, and I hope everyone enjoys the analysis! Comments and ratings are much appreciated.}
