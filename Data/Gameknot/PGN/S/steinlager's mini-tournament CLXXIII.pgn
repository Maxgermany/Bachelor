1. b3 {Playing in a tournament and again this is my first win.} e5 {My opening was pawn to b3 and black moved his pawn to e5.  I want to fianchetto and attack that e5 pawn.} 2. d3 {I moved another pawn to d3, coming out quietly but with protection and no sacrifice for black.} h6 {Black comes down the h file with pawn to h6.  Black may be preparing for on his attack on the king side.  } 3. Bb2 {I bring out my DB to b2 accessing the diagonal.} Nc6 {Black next move is Nc6.  Protecting his pawn at e5 and covering some central squares.} 4. e3 {I move my pawn to e3 allowing my queen to get access to h5 diagonal.  Also I now have places for my knights to develop safely.} Bb4+ {Black develops his DB to b4 and checks my king.} 5. Nc3 {I move my knight to c3 blocking the check on my king and developing my knight with my bishop at b2 protecting my knight.} d6 {Black pushes his d pawn out to d6 to protect his e5 pawn.} 6. Nge2 {I develop my knight to e2 and join my knights up so they can protect each other.} Bg4 {Now black decides to attack my e2 knight with his LB on g4.  I don't expect this to affect white too much as the bishop can be knocked back quite easily.} 7. h3 {I move my pawn to h3 attacking the LB.} Bh5 {Black could have taken and doubled my pawns on the h file but instead retreats to h5 but I may not be finished yet with that LB.} 8. g4 {So I push my g pawn getting development and pushing the LB again.} Bg6 {Black's LB moves again to g6 and I think I am probably looking better in terms of development as black has had to make 3 moves with his LB and I have gained development whilst defending.} 9. Bg2 {I now move my LB out to g2 to access a diagonal to a8 and allowing my king to castle.} d5 {Black pushes pawn d6 to d5 which again wastes a move.  Perhaps better would have been to make that move at the start and then he could have been moving his g8 knight out with that last move.} 10. d4 {I move d3 to d4 giving me a chain of pawns and attacking his e5 pawn whilst the pawn is protected by the knight at e2..} exd4 {Black captures my d4 pawn and attacks my c3 knight.} 11. Nxd4 {I capture the pawn with my e2 knight and I am now attacking his knight at c6.} Nxd4 {Black captures my knight at d4 and is likely to be captured by my queen or e3 pawn.} 12. Qxd4 {I capture the knight with my queen and I now have black's DB at b4 which is vulnerable and likely to be captured by my queen if not moved.  This may force the DB to capture my knight.} Bxc3+ {Black captures my knight as I thought and will either be retaken by the queen or the DB.} 13. Qxc3 {I capture with my queen and there are no attackers at my gates, for now.} Nf6 {I should now think of castling but which side.  Black develops his g8 knight to f6.} 14. O-O-O {I castle long which brings my rook to d1 opposite the black queen at d8.  There is a pawn between us so no immediate attack threatened.} Qe7 {Now black moves his queen out to e7 to allow his king to castle.} 15. f3 {I move my pawn f2 to f3 to prevent the knight from moving down to e4.} O-O-O {Black castles long.} 16. Rhf1 {My pawns at f3 and h3 are protected by my LB at g2 and I move my rook over to f1.  I am not sure if I should have moved to e1 as that is the file which the queen is on at e7.  The f1 square is protected by the LB so believe this move to be better.} Bh7 {Black moves his LB back to h7.  I am not sure if this is to retreat so that I forget about him, which is easy to do, and then they shoot out and attack when needed.  He is still pointing at c2 the square above my king on c1.} 17. Rf2 {I move my f1 rook up to f2 to protect the c2 square from the LB.} c6 {Black completes a pawn chain with c6 which protects d5.  However he has weakened his king by allowing access to the dark squares on the diagonal f4 to c7 with the king at c8.} 18. Rd4 {I push my d1 rook up to d4 taking control of the 4th rank.} Nd7 {Black moves his f6 knight to d7.} 19. b4 {I move my pawn b3 to b4 protected by the queen at c3 and rook at d4.  The black queen is at e7 and there is only a pawn at e3 protected by my queen.} g5 {Black pushes his pawn g7 to g5.  } 20. f4 {I push my f3 pawn to f4 attacking the g5 pawn.  I have the rook at f2 protecting my pawn.} gxf4 {Black captures my pawn at f4.} 21. Rfxf4 {I capture the pawn with my rook and I now have 2 rooks on the 4th rank.} Nf8 {Black moves his d7 knight to f8 to attack my rook by going to squares e6 or g6.  The e6 square would attack both rooks.} 22. Kb1 {Now the rook has moved from f2 I feel my king would be safer across on b1 so that the DB can access c1 square to defend.} Ne6 {As anticipated in my previous comment black now moves his knight to e6 to attack my rooks at d4 and f4.  I say that now but I am not sure I saw this coming in the game.} 23. Qa3 {I move my queen to a3 thinking to attack the king via the 'A' file as only pawns preventing this.} a6 {So black moves his a7 pawn to a6 preventing my queen from attacking the square at a7.  I now am on the same diagonal as the black queen at e7 with my pawn at b4 between us.} 24. b5 {I push my b4 pawn up and attack the queen looking to exchange but I am protected if she takes whilst she does not have a defender.} Nxd4 {The knight does what he came to do and steals a rook at d4 and is attacked by my LB at b2.  Also my rook at f4 is attacking the knight.} 25. Qxe7 {I ignore the knight which is not threatening anything much other than my c2 pawn.  I capture the queen on e7.} Rde8 {Black moves his d8 rook across to e8 and attacks the queen.} 26. Qxf7 {I move my queen over to f7 and capture a pawn whilst bringing my queen and rook together on the f file.} Rxe3 {Black moves his rook down to e3 and captures my pawn.  Black can check the king on the 1st rank but I am not worried.} 27. Rxd4 {I now take the knight on d4 with my f4 rook and I am able to block the rook on e3 should he decide to check the king.  But this may not be needed.} Re1+ {Black moves the rook down to e1 and checks my king.} 28. Bc1 {I move my DB to c1 and block the check.  Black's LB is still at h7 quietly waiting.  } Bxc2+ {Black takes my pawn at c2 with his LB checking the king.} 29. Kxc2 {The king retakes this LB.} Rhe8 {Black brings his h8 rook to e8 to join with the e1 rook and take control of the file.} 30. Rd2 {My rook at d4 can only move sideways so cannot immediately act with my queen on f7 to attack black's king so I move the rook down from d4 to d2 beside the king.} d4 {I captured black's queen and I have the bishop pair and rook, while black only has 2 rooks.  Black is short on fire power and therefore cannot bring his other rook down to join his e1 rook as this would be captured by my d2 rook.  Also he may be leaving it at e8 as my queen is at f7 and it is the only defender on the back rank.  So he pushes a pawn to d4.  He may be thinking to use this to give him protection if he were to come down the e file with his other rook.} 31. Bf3 {I move my LB to f3 in case black should decide to come down with his other rook it will provide some defence.} Re8e5 {Black does bring his e8 rook to e5 using his pawn as protection.  The rook has only one white pawn at b5 which he could take.} 32. Rd1 {I decide to attack the rook at e1 and move my d2 rook down to d1.} Rc5+ {Black moves his rook over to c5 and checks the king.  Leaving the pawn at b5, he may regret that.} 33. Kd2 {I move my king over and out of check.} Ree5 {Black cannot afford to lose his rook on e1 and moves it to the e5 square.} 34. b6 {I quickly move my b5 pawn up to b6 and out of black's clutches.  Black's c5 rook is unable to do much as there is a black pawn at c6 so it can only go sideways whilst black's e5 rook can move up the e file to act in defence of the king.} Kb8 {The king moves over to b8 but it is obvious that black's days are numbered.} 35. Qc7+ {I went with Qc7 using my pawn as defence and checked the king.  } Ka8 36. Qc8# {King moves to a8 and with Qc8  and pawn at b6 its checkmate.}
