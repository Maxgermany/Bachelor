1. e4 {in this game. Legal's mate is used - this could be a useful tactic to you in the future.  e4 - a classic chess opening} e5 {An appropriate reply} 2. Nf3 {f3. the best place (out of the 3 moves it can make) to place your g1 knight. } d6 {a common but not all tht great move. opens up this queenside for an attack} 3. Bc4 {a move I made because i thought he might fall for the trap.} Bg4 {a move which is practically forced if black wants a sensible opening} 4. Nc3 {a common move.  and again the best place where you can put your b1 knight} Nc6 {Nc6 - a  move which is common in this position and is crucial to Legal's mate. If Black had moved his other knight to f6 th eplan wouldn't have worked. you'll see why.} 5. Nxe5 {Ne5? A stupid move... or not? } Bxd1 {perfectly reasonable but now it is forced checkmate} 6. Bxf7+ {Got him!} Ke7 {forced} 7. Nd5# {good game, useful tactic}
