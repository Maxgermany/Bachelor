1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {main line} a6 {most common reply. However, Nf6 is also common} 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O b5 {driving the bishop to b3 also playable is Nxe4 leading into the Berlin defense} 6. Bb3 Be7 {Black can play the sharp 6. ...Bc5 archangel defense or transpose into the Berlin defense} 7. Re1 d6 8. c3 {First world champion Wilhem Stienitiz developed this way of playing the white pieces. He would first construct an unbreakable center with pawns on d3 and c3 in order to keep his opponent at arms length. Then he would gradually build up a direct attack on the king side, often by advancing g2-g4 and bring his knight all the way over from b1 to g3. } O-O 9. h3 {Question: Why does white move his h-pawn? Isn't he neglecting the center? The answer: Nimzowitish once said that chess mastery was revealed by making a pawn move on the wing with your mind on the center. With the prophylactic 9. h3 white prevents the pin that would otherwise undermine the defense of the d4-pawn after 9. d4 Bg4!} Na5 {By threatening to exchange the knight for the bishop black gains time to bring his c-pawn into the fight} 10. Bc2 c5 {This is the main line of chirgion defense a very powerful defense for black. Black gives up control of d5 in order to gain a lions share of the c -file especially c5 and c4. If white is not careful a black knight on c4 is the barer of doom and gloom. Therefore, white must play to prevent that from happening. } 11. d4 {White completes his center, but the D4-point is already under pressure from the two black pawns. } Qc7 {The main idea of 11. ...Qc7 is that black can now maintain the pawn on e5. From here it can get quite mind boggling the options that are available to black. For example, a popular alternative to ...Qc7 is 11. ...Nd7 12. Nbd2 and now a) 12. ...cxd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 14. Nb3 a5 15. Be3 a4 16. Nbd2 is similar to the game structure. b) 12. ...exd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 14. d5 Nce5 15. a4! Rb8 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 17. axb5 axb5 18. f4 Ng6 19. Nf3+/-} 12. Nbd2 {Now black has a critical decision to make. Should he open the c-file by exchanging pawns with 12. ...cxd4 or maintain the tension between the d4 and c5 pawns, which allows white if he wishes to play d4-d5, closing the queen side? } Re8 {Black opts for the closed Chirgion. Black wants to quietly develop his remaining pieces, this allows white to block the center, after which a familiar pawn chain is set up on the queen side} 13. b3 {This rules out a strategic idea for black. Black intends to answer the famous knight retreat 13. Nf1 with cxd4 14. cxd4 exd4 15. Nxd4 d5 16. e5 Ne4 17. f3 Bc5 18. fxe4 dxe4  with complications that seem to favor black. But what about 13. ...c4? the answer is 13. ...c4 14. b4! Nc6 15. d5 Nb8 16. a4 black's queen side pawns are under stress. The other main reason why white plays b3 is to play Bb2 in the event that black does play 13. ...cxd4 14. cxd4 Nc6 15. Bb2 supporting the d4-pawn} Bf8 {not a good move for black This idea behind 13. ...Bf8 comes from the idea to stop the white knight manoeuvre Nbd2, Nf1 and Ng3. This passive move allows white to build up a dominating position on both sides of the board. The right idea is to maneuver this bishop via d8 to b6 and focus on his development on the queen side. } 14. d5 {This seals the center and ensure White a enduring advantage. On the queen side white has established a characteristic "attacking" pawn structure. The black knight on a5 has no single good safe square. It is therefore easy to conclude that white is better. But by how much? The blocked lines in the center and on the queen side are also impeding the white pieces. So I would assess the position as objectively only slightly better for white, but the kind that is horrible to defend against.  } g6 {This unprovoked weakness will cost black later in the game. Yet even at this stage it is not a game changer. All I am saying is it is almost always wise to keep the pawns in front of the king close to the chest. } 15. Nf1 {Completing the knight maneuver to g3 } Nh5 {discouraging Ng3 and preparing to attack e4 with ...f5 at some point in the future.} 16. Be3 {The bishop sits on a dangerous diagonal if black tries to open things up with c5-c4} Nb7 {supporting the c5 point in the event of c5-c4 but clearly if black could he would have preferred Nc6. } 17. Qe2 {defending e4 and anticipating a possible b5-b4 when after the exchange the queen can take advantage of the light square weakness. For example 17. ...b4 18. cxb4 c4 19. Qc4! Qxc4 20. bxc4 is objectively better for white. } Bd7 {countering white's idea of taking control of the light squares on the queen side} 18. Ng3 {I am thinking that 18. ...Nxg3 19. fxg3 would give me good pressure along the f-file and more room to maneuver on the king side. However, the trade off is that e3 and e4 are weakened. This is a fact that black does try to exploit} Nxg3 {I think 18. ...Nf4 has to be seriously looked as an improvement. The exchange has the advantage of weakening e4. } 19. fxg3 c4 {Black decided to play c5-c4 but it does come at a price. With the DSB sitting on f8 it will be hard to hold off an invasion along the dark squares. Also a negative is that the bishop on e3 has great influence now. Therefore, 19. ...Be7 20. Qf2 Qa5 attacking c3 has to be recommended. } 20. bxc4 Rec8 {typical thematic move in the chirgion defense. Black puts all resources on to the c-file. Of course black has very little chance of any serious counter play if he can not win the c3 pawn. } 21. Nd2 {Defending c4 and wanting to play Nb3} Qa5 {attacking c3 and there is no real good way to defend it. If white plays 22. Rec1 Qxc3 23. a4 Qb2 24. Rab1 Qa3 and the queen escapes with the pawn. Another problem for white after ...Qxc3 is the e3 weakness. But from white's perspective after ...Qxc3 the black queen can get trapped under the right conditions. Therefore taking on c3 for black is risky. } 22. a4 {! now Qxc3 does not work because white is one step ahead of the game. Here the Gameknot engine says this is a mistake and offers 22. cxb5 Rxc3 23. bxa6 Qxa6 24. Qxa6 Rxa6 25. Bd1 Ra8 26. a4 Be7 27. Ra2 Bf6 28. Kh1 Nc5 29. a5 Kg7 as better. } Qxc3 {I think this is a big mistake I think what the gameknot engine offers was the best 22. ...bxa4 } 23. Rec1 Qb2 {forced or the queen is trapped} 24. Rab1 Qa3 {again forced} 25. Kf2 {!! subtle but wins everything else leads to equality but is wildly complicated.  The point is that black's only escape route for the queen is the exchange on e3. Now e3 is supported by the king which frees the queen for active duty. Now ironically the Gameknot engine see this as a big mistake and gives 25. Ra1 Qb2 26. Rab1 Qa3 etc as the best line. In other word the engine says the game is a draw.} Nc5 {Before this move the gameknot engine says the position is roughly level with a score of -0.57 } 26. cxb5 {and now it says it is + 1.77 winning advantage for white. so I do not think it understands the value of 25. Kf2} axb5 27. axb5 {a strong advanced pawn that is well supported. As a result black has to force exchanges to weaken it} Qc3 {x-raying the rook on c1} 28. Kg1 {avoiding black's idea of Nd3 forking the king and rook } Bxb5 29. Rxb5 Nd3 30. Bxd3 {Now 30. Qxd3? Qxd3 31. Bxd3 Rxc1+ 32. Kf2 is more than likely a draw since black can keep the center static by defending d6. However, after the game move the d6-pawn will fall ensuring a powerful white d-pawn} Qxc1+ {Black finally manages to secure the c-file but he has lost the centre} 31. Kh2 Rcb8 {31. ...Ra2 is very complicated and unclear for example a) 32. Qg4 h5 33. Qf3 Qc7 24. Nc4 Rb8 or b) 32. Rb6 Rb2 33. Nb1 Rxe2 34. Bxc1 Ra2 35. Rc6 Rb8 36. Nc3 Ra1 37. Nb5 f6 are better for white but not easy to prove. } 32. Nc4 {defending the rook by a discovery attack on the queen. FYI 31. ...Ra2 would have prevented this} Qc3 33. Bd2 Qd4 34. Rxb8 Rxb8 35. g4 {preventing ...f5} Rb3 36. Bc2 Rb8 37. g5 Be7 38. Qd3 {Offering the exchange of queens but of course black refuses} Qf2 39. Qc3 Rc8 40. Bd3 Qa7 41. Qa5 {wins the pawn on d6 } Qd4 42. Qa6 Rc5 {The last major mistake. 42... Rc7 43. Qb5 Rc8 44. Qb3 Qa7 45. Be3 Rb8 46. Qc2 is unclear} 43. Nxd6 {With the fall of the d6-pawn so goes black. } Qf2 44. Qa8+ {Everything from here on out is practically forced by black. } Bf8 45. Qe8 Rc7 {If 45. ...Qxd2 then it is mate in 2 46. Qxf7 Kh8 47. Qxf8++} 46. Be2 Re7 {If .46... Qxe2 47. Nf5 gxf5 48. Bb4 h6 49. Qxf8+ Kh7 50. gxh6 f6 51. Be7 Rxe7 52. Qxe7+ Kxh6 53. Qxf6+ Kh7 54. Qxf5+ Kh6 55. d6 Kg7 56. h4 Qb2 57. d7 Qd4 58. Qg5+ Kh7 59. Qe7+ Kg6 60. d8=Q Qxd8 61. Qxd8 Kf7 62. Qd7+ Kg6 63. g4 Kf6 64. Kg3 Kg6 65. g5 Kh5 66. Qf7#   } 47. Qb5 Ra7 48. Qb8 Ra2 49. Nc8 {Threatening mate in 3 49... Qxe2 50. Ne7+ Kg7 51. Qxe5+ f6 52. Qxf6#} Qc5 50. Be3 Qa3 51. Bd3 Qb2 52. Ne7+ {This allows the d-pawn to advance after the queen exchange} Kg7 53. Qxb2 Rxb2 54. Bc5 Rd2 55. Bc4 {black resigns as after 55. ...Rc2 56. d6 Rxc4 57. d7 Bxe7 58. Bxe7 Rd4 59. d8=Q Rxd8 60. Bxd8 for the win}
