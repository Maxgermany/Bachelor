1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 h6 5. h4 Bd6 6. Ne5 Nh5 {Good. I had to choose among the knight on d2 or the pawn on e3. Both are on the agenda anyway, but the order allowed this. Now, the normal move, Bh2, is questionable due to Qxh4. } 7. Nxf7 {...so let's solve the situation with a non-inmediate-return-value.} Kxf7 {...the alternative is to save the queen and accept BxB. Probably better. } 8. Bxd6 Qxd6 9. e4 {I'm lost, here, due to the "hole" I left in b4. But let my opponent dare to play it and prove it will be quicker than my attack. } Nf4 10. e5 {Of course I don't want his queen to enter the kingside, even letting him take the "hole". } Qb6 {Bad move. Qb4 was very hard to meet. Now I can save the position with...} 11. Nb3 Re8 {Useless move that makes my victory much easier. } 12. Qf3 g5 13. hxg5 hxg5 14. g3 {...or Rh7+, followed by Bd3. If NxB, QxN defends the rook and threats an unstoppable penetration. } Nc6 15. c3 {Better to stay calm. I can still lose this. I'm a piece under, after all. } Na5 {Good, another tempo to me. He needs two move to become dangerous, and that is exatly what I need. } 16. gxf4 Nxb3 {I would have gone Nc4, and welcome the exchange BxN. } 17. fxg5+ Ke7 {The right sequence to mate is Rh7+, Qf6+. But I went wrong again. } 18. Qf6+ Kd7 19. Rh7+ Kc6 {Now, I have to justify my game. And a delicate dance starts. } 20. axb3 Qxb3 21. Ra5 {Threatens Rc5+.} b6 22. Bb5+ Kb7 {Free way to c7, and black needs just one more tempo to become dangerous... } 23. Qf7 {Unstoppable. } bxa5 24. Qxc7# {}
