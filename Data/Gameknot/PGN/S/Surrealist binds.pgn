1. d4 {[%clk 0:05:05] Standard opening... } e6 { } 2. Bf4 { } d5 { } 3. Nf3 { } c5 4. c3 { } Nc6 { } 5. e3 { } Qb6 {[%clk 0:05:12] All main line till here, if I'm not wrong.  } 6. Qb3 {[%clk 0:05:22] The usual answer, convinced that... } Qxb3 { } 7. axb3 {[%clk 0:05:25] ...is bad for black, due to the semiopen column.  } Nf6 8. h3 {[%clk 0:05:20] To shield the dsb if needed. This B will turn into a footstepper... } cxd4 { } 9. exd4 { } Be7 10. Bc7 {[%clk 0:05:13] ? I saw he couldn't play a7xB, so I could have played it there. Instead, I could have gone for it a move before. But it is a mistake, because, ok, I can put the B there, but it CAN'T take the pawn while Nc6 is there, so it's a bad plan. Ugly start.  } O-O { } 11. Bb6 Bd7 {[%clk 0:04:48] ...and now my B is danger with no compensation. Black has developed very finely, thank to my ugly idea.  } 12. Bc7 {[%clk 0:04:52] With shame! Nothing better. Bc5, BxB, dxB leaves me naked in the center.  } Rfc8 13. Bf4 {[%clk 0:04:50] If ever you could think a better way to waste four tempos, please show me!!! :-) } h6 14. g4 {[%clk 0:04:54] Of course I am more ambitious than simple developing-castling-and see what happens! } g5 {[%clk 0:04:20] } 15. Bg3 { } Ne4 {[%clk 0:04:20] Yes. Due to lack of developement, now I suffer. I didn't put the dsb on h2 because I'm eyeing a future h4, but now I realize that I just helped him, again! } 16. Ne5 {[%clk 0:04:33] The plan was: he takes my B (NxB), I take his (NxBd7). He would likely take my R (NxRh1), and I'll have Nb6, forking the two rooks, while a7 is pinned again. The black N on h1 is whorth the f2 pawn.  } Nxe5 {[%clk 0:04:03] Black, as predicted, sensed some trick, and went for this one, that momentarily saves my dsb.  } 17. Bxe5 {[%clk 0:04:31] ...of course, allowing... } f6 { } 18. Bh2 {[%clk 0:04:30] Now my B can go to a nearly seure refuge, at the cost of the loss of the h4 plan. I have to develop, but I have to be very careful with tricks like Nd2, Nxc3, bxc3, Rxc3. With the B pair, black will win easily like that, so developing the N via d2 is a dangerous option.  } f5 {[%clk 0:04:06] As predicted, black will use his pawn's storm. And I have to find moves. f3 kicks black's N, but... then? I would never be able to take it back, and what future is there for my lsb? I looked hard, and I started to laugh.  } 19. Be5 {[%clk 0:04:20] Would I EVER play another piece during the game? But, look: it makes sense! It's the only drawback of f5. It blocks black lsb's action. Reactivates a latent threat on the h column, covering h8. The B is not easily kickable, and black would exchange his dsb for it. If black plays fxh4, while e6 stays there, it's all in my favour.  } Bd6 {[%clk 0:03:52] Of course, black should have played f4, while f3 becomes impossible due to Ng3. Now, I can play BxB, NxB, f3 or h4. But, as always... } 20. Nd2 {[%clk 0:04:12] Now after NxN, BxB! and I am who keeps the B pair.  } Bxe5 21. dxe5 {[%clk 0:03:51] The latent threat Nxc3, saccing a N for two pawns is still possible, but I sense my opponent is not going for it.  } Nxd2 {[%clk 0:03:46] As predicted. This helps me a lot.  } 22. Kxd2 {[%clk 0:03:54] The dust dawn, the game is still playable!  } Bc6 { } 23. Rh2 {[%clk 0:03:43] The pawn in f3, I sense that is just cramping myself.  } Rcd8 {[%clk 0:03:27] If d4, c5. This is going to a dead end, and a draw. } 24. Re1 {[%clk 0:03:34] Setting gxf5 as a possible threat to have a goner. But on white square, it will be not optimal. } Kg7 {[%clk 0:03:18] This stops me from trying h4.  } 25. Bd3 {[%clk 0:03:22] Aiming to h7, just in case... } f4 {[%clk 0:03:16] Thanks black! You gave me hope. Because I have a7 in mind, not h8. See:  } 26. h4 { } Rdh8 { } 27. f3 {[%clk 0:02:53] Now I need this move in order to block Blsb's action on h1, in order to play my R there. Another plan was b4-b5, but with b6, Bb7, I would have got nothing.  } a6 {[%clk 0:03:18] Black underestimates the danger! } 28. Ke2 {[%clk 0:02:41] I have to cover f3. Note that e5 is untouchable! } b5 {[%clk 0:03:10] Black is coming... } 29. Reh1 {[%clk 0:02:44] Now or never.  } Rac8 {[%clk 0:02:54] Another loss of tempo! I'm done! } 30. hxg5 { } hxg5 {[%clk 0:02:56] My opponent though in drawn, but I have seen this many moves before. } 31. Rh2h7+ {This is the basis of my plan on h, and a move I felt some proud of. } Rxh7 32. Rxh7+ Kg8 {[%clk 0:02:50] Now I'm in control, and I can win a pawn. An important one.  } 33. Rh5 Kf7 { } 34. Rxg5 {[%clk 0:02:56] This allows Rh8, but...  } Rg8 {[%clk 0:02:40] ?  } 35. Rh5 {[%clk 0:02:53] Again in control. It's a matter of time, now... for a win or a draw. Or so I thought! } Kg7 {[%clk 0:02:36] I can't believe it! Black didn't realize the nature of his bind, and allows me to repeat it once more. I couldn't resist! And I had my second laugh.  } 36. Rh7+ Kf8 37. Ra7 {[%clk 0:02:41] I thought this was smart, but it wasn't. Black can return me the courtesy with his R on h, and I don't want to lose for a stupid overconfident move. K to g2 are two tempos, too much. And d4 is still a latent break black has.  } Rh8 {[%clk 0:02:34] I'm in no position to be foolish.  } 38. Rh7 Kg8 { } 39. Rxh8+ Kxh8 {[%clk 0:02:32] And this, I think, seals the draw. Or it should. Can you believe? We went on. And we got the more interesting part of the game, due to mistakes. Let's see:  } 40. Kf2 {[%clk 0:02:11] I can penetrate into g5, so I force black to go there in order to defend it. I can't do much more than that! } Kg7 { } 41. Kg2 Kh6 42. Kh3 Kg5 {[%clk 0:02:32] I knew I'd have got late, but now if he goes, I'll go to h4. e5, believe it or not, is still untouchable! } 43. c4 {[%clk 0:02:04] ?? I had to be sensible, and play for the draw. In fact, I think I offered it somewhere before now. I decided to see if e6 is worse or better than f3 (now I pay for have played it!) } dxc4 {[%clk 0:02:31] } 44. bxc4 {[%clk 0:02:06] The idea is that if Bxf3, cxb5, and if Bxg4+, Kg2, axb4, Bxb5, and I am probably lost... his c pawn is nearer than my b one. A little headache for me!} b4 {[%clk 0:02:22] A surprise for me. I felt lucky again.  } 45. Kg2 { } a5 {[%clk 0:02:22] I couldn't see that black is winning here... } 46. b3 {[%clk 0:01:35] ?? A fatal mistake! Can you see it? Oh, my... } a4 {[%clk 0:02:20] My K is too far to help, and black will exchange and get promoted! After all, with this simple and innocent move I threw the game away! } 47. Bc2 {[%clk 0:01:31] ?? Trying to get axb3, but of course... } a3 {[%clk 0:02:23] ! :-( I condemned my lsb into two squares! For nothing!} 48. Bb1 {[%clk 0:01:33] You can laugh at me. I didn't laugh, here. What a stupid thing I've done! Now, black will get me in some kind of stupid zugzwang... sigh! } Kh4 { } 49. Ba2 { } Be8 50. c5 {[%clk 0:01:17] Well... I have pawns too. This begins to look like a studio. } Bc6 51. Bb1 { } Bd5 { } 52. Ba2 { } Kg5 53. Kf2 { } Kh6 { } 54. Ke2 { } Kg6 { } 55. Bb1+ Kg5 { } 56. Ba2 Kh4 {He can hardly go further than that. } 57. Kf2 Kh3 {[%clk 0:02:14] ?? "Finally", black got his K in. And, since my lsb is "pinned"... yes, but in doing all this, he forgets I have pawns too. And this is a definitive mistake. I didn't forgive him (chess is not for pity!).  } 58. g5 {[%clk 0:01:23] Black can't stop both pawns, g and c. Game over. Could you smile at least once? I hope so! If not, play the game in "fast forward", and enjoy the dsb's dance... :-D } Bc6 { } 59. g6 { } Be8 { } 60. g7 {....or c6. } Bf7 {[%clk 0:02:11] } 61. Bb1 {Useless move. } Kh4 { } 62. c6 Kg5 { } 63. c7 Kh6 { } 64. c8=Q { } Kxg7 { } 65. Qc4 { }
