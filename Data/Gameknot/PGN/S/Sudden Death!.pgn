1. e4 {Hi everyone!  In the middlegame I won a pawn and my mating attack fizzled out.  It looked as if I would make no headway whatsoever.  Then John made a pawn move and allowed a rook incursion onto h7.  John tried to save his pawn but it lead to a rook fork on his king and knight.  He tried to save his knight by protecting it with his king only for him to lose his king, oops!  As before I attach a Computer Analysis Link to this annotation:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13875778&rnd=0.42159364684212413} c5 {1. ....... c5 - in response to my trusty 1.e4 I get the Sicilian Defense with c5.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 {5. Nc3 - after a very standard Sicilian pawn trade both sides continue to develop.} a6 6. Be3 {6. Be3 - now Fou Lenoir comes out - black's last move to a6 was the Naijdorf (Kasparov liked that move).} Nc6 7. f3 Bd7 {7. ...... Bd7 - a somewhat conservative developing move.  I think this is to prevent the black pawns from becoming separated should I choose to exchange knights on c6 at an appropriate moment.} 8. g4 e5 9. Nb3 Be6 10. g5 {10. g5 - this pawn push resembles the Byrne Attack.  As black has not castled kingside this advance is to tie down black's king knight.} Nh5 11. Nd5 Bxd5 12. Qxd5 {12. Qxd5 - this B for N trade has brought Glenda into the centre.  However, she is about to be driven back again to d2 which is her normal spot for the Byrne/Fisher Attack.} Nb4 13. Qd2 d5 {13. ...... d5? - loses pawn as follows.} 14. c3 {14. c3 - deflection - the black knight on b4 which is defending the d5 pawn is driven back.  Therefore the d5 pawn is twice attacked and only once defended.  This can only mean one thing.  Black now loses a pawn.} Nc6 15. Qxd5 {15. Qxd5 - Gameknot recommended exd5 - please refer to the link for further detail.} Nf4 16. Bxf4 exf4 {16. .... exf4 - this minor piece trade doubles up black's kingside pawns.  Maybe black is trying to play for an endgame with opposite colour bishops and earn a possible draw.  Hmm.} 17. Bc4 Qxd5 18. Bxd5 {18. Bxd5 - queen trade.} Ne5 19. Ke2 {19. Ke2 - I would have preferred 0-0-0 but if I do then I will drop the f3 pawn.  Henry must defend it or I will lose it.  At least this move connects my two rooks and with the queens off the board Henry is relatively safe on e2.} Rb8 20. Rad1 h6 21. h4 hxg5 22. hxg5 Rxh1 23. Rxh1 {23. Rxh1 - over the last few moves one pawn and a set of rooks have been traded off.  My g5 pawn looks weak but my rook does control the h file.  There is the little matter of one pesky knight to get around before I can press home my 1 pawn advantage however.} Ng6 24. Nc1 b5 25. Nd3 {25. Nd3 - this knight manoeuvre puts some pressure on the f4 pawn.  However, here comes black's dsb.} Bd6 26. Kf2 Ke7 27. b3 {27. b3 - a seemingly nothing sort of move for the want of anything better to do but I thought I would either try and get a passer on the c file or trade black down to 2 pawns against one on the queenside.  This would create another set of targets for black to defend.} f6 {27. ...... f6?? - gameknot analysis here suggested Ne5 here.  Even I could see that move was bad although I had to analyse carefully before playing my rook to h7.  The rook move to h7 is very strong because it results in another pawn drop for black.} 28. Rh7 fxg5 {28. ..... fxg5?? - this move avoids the loss of a pawn but allows something far far worse.} 29. Rxg7+ {29. Rxg7+ - a rook fork on the BK and black knight.} Kf6 {29. ....... Kf6?? - this move defends the knight but now Old Matey appears out of nowhere and deals sudden death on the black king.  Commiserations and better luck next time John!} 30. Rf7# {}
