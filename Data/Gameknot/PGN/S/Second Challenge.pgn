[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation"]

1. e4 c6 {Caro-Kann.  A fairly conservative, but solid defence by Black.  Truth to tell, my record against the Caro is not what you'd call stellar.} 2. d4 {The usual response.  But also playable is 2.Nc3.  +++++++  There can also emerge from this opening a 'Demolition Derby' Gambit arising from a Grand Prix line: 1.e4 c6 2.f4!? d5  3.Nf3 dxe4  4.Ng5 Nf6  5.Bc4 Bg4 6.Qxg4!? Nxg4 7.Bxf7ch Kd7 8.Be6ch Kc7 9.Bxg4 ... White gets two minor pieces and a strong initiative for the Queen.} d5 {The usual response.  Instead 2...d6 has been played, as in a famous game from the 1950s, M.Tal vs V. Simagin.} 3. e5 {Advance Variation.  This was a favourite of Aron Nimzovitch, though it didn't go as well for him as the analogous line in the French Defence (1.e4 e6  2.d54 d5  3.e5 ...).  Mischa Tal tried it also in his matches against M. Botvinnik.  It is by no means my favourite. I prefer the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, 3.c4, but I thought I try something a bit more ... classical.} Bf5 {In my view, Black's best and most logical move.  In 1961 M. Botvinnik played 3...c5, in games 4, 6 and 8, vs M. Tal.  After draws in the first two games, Tal stomped all over him in the third outing.  Botvinnik thereafter switched to the bishop move.} 4. Nf3 e6 5. Be2 {The most often seen tries back in the day were the obvious looking 6.Bd3, and Tal's troglodyte attack by 6.h4.  The bishop exchange brought on by the former tended to leave White short of a valuable attacking asset; but 6...h5 was an apt response to the pawn thrust.  This move is a conservative development that keeps interest in the K-side, but retains White' s'good' bishop - the one operating on the light squares, whilst the centre pawns occupy the dark.} Nd7 6. O-O Ne7 {Still book.  Black is just a little bit cramped here, nothing serious - you'll see what she does about it anon - but it does mean some tight manoeuvring.} 7. Nh4 {Played with the intention of exchanging this knight for Black's light-square bishop.  I am quite prepared to accept the loss of time to compass this.} Bg6 {Black prefers to accept a slight loss of time as well to effect the exchange on g6 rather than f5, where the recapturing knight could become a target to, say, g2-g4.} 8. c3 {I could equally well have taken the g6-bishop at once.  But as the bishop is not going anywhere, I can devote my energies elsewhere for the nonce.  So I shore up my centre.} c5 {Thematic pawn break that is often a feature of the Advance French as well.  Black strikes at the base of the pawn chain at d4.  The motivation behind this is that after ...cxd4; cxd4, White is left with a weakness at d4 that has to be defended by pieces.  On the other hand, dxc5 by White leaves the e5-pawn wanting supports.  +++++++ It is just possible Black might also be considering pushing the pawn to c4, with a view to striking at c3.  But that is a more difficult target to hit, even if the first stage of the plan is successfully carried out.} 9. Be3 {Overprotecting d4, whilst keeping the f-pawn free to advance.} Nc6 {Continuing to develop.  At this stage the GK engine gives +0.76 to White - slightly the better game, but not a whole lot in it.} 10. Nxg6 hxg6 {White is not over-concerned about the opening of the h-file, feeling that any attack that Black can contrive will be contained easily enough.} 11. Nd2 {At this point, I had it in mind that the knight would continue on to f3. Had Black played 11...Qh4, it probably would have done.} cxd4 {The GK engine now calls this +1.08 an edge for White.  That seems a bit generous.  Black is doing quite well so far.  This exchange is quite in keeping with Black's aims in this opening.} 12. cxd4 Be7 13. Rc1 {Immediately establishing a presence on the c-file.  There were other options.  Looking at it now, I might instead have considered 13.a3, with the idea 14.Qc2 and 15.Bd3, striking towards g6.} O-O {Abandoning all thought of attack down the h-file.  Not unreasonable.  The shape of the game seems to indicate that Black's prospects lie on the Q-side.} 14. Bb5 {Threatening to win a pawn, or at least to leave Black with a backward pawn flapping in the wind of the half-open c-file (e.g. 14...Rc8 15.Bxc6 Rxc6  16.Rxc6 bxc6  17.Qc2 or Nb3.} Nb4 {Answers that threat, but the knight becomes a target.} 15. a3 {I find this little move to be much more effective, as a rule, when it strikes at something.} Na6 {...Nc6 simply dropped a pawn.  This move, though, has its own downside.  At this point the GK engine give white a +1.56 lead - White has decidedly the better of it now.  I had already formed a plan that was to win me a pawn.} 16. Bxa6 bxa6 {Two sets of doubled pawns!  But that on the g-file is insignificant, and hardly weakens Black's K-side at all.  More of an asset than a liability. The isolated pair on the a-file is a bit more of a consideration, vulnerable as they are.} 17. Qa4 {Attacking the target pawn at once.} Nb8 {Defending.  The difficulty Black now faces is that White now has a firm grasp of the initiative, but Black finds herself having to respond with to-and-fro moves. That is very frustrating for a defender.} 18. Nb3 {Forget about f3: this knight has his eye on c5 and a6.} Nd7 {Probably a wise choice, to let go the lead a-pawn to keep the White knight out of c5.} 19. Qxa6 Nb8 {An unexpected attempt to chase away the Queen.  I could not resist forcing the knight to move again...} 20. Qb7 Nd7 {At this stage, the GK engine give White the edge by +2.14 - a considerable advantage.  Yet the engine has not yet pointed up any real mistake by Black (although in my view, 14...Nb4 might not have been the best option Black had then available).   She's hanging in there, trying to hold a fairly passive sort of position. White now establishes a pair of heavy pieces on the seventh rank.} 21. Rc7 {This sort of thing is usually a sure sign one has a fine game going.} Rb8 {Resolute defence.  Black was faced with enormous pressure along her second rank.  The only defence for the knight was to move it, but that exposed the bishop to immediate capture.  This rook move was the best defence available, though it cost a pawn. } 22. Qxa7 Ra8 {Well played!  Instead, 22...Rxb3 23.Rxd7 ... would still have lost Black a piece.} 23. Qb7 Rb8 {Will White repeat moves?  } 24. Qc6 {No.  This was the plan all along.  The only alternative was Qa7 which would have led to a repetition and a draw.  But having cleared out both Black a-pawns, White's own become targets...} Rxb3 25. Rxd7 Qb8 {Desperate... but abandoning the bishop to its fate was unnecessary.  This is the first move actually called a mistake by the GK engine.  Although 25...Qe8 looked horribly passive, it is not so easy for White to find a convincing follow up.  I would just about have to find 26.Bc1 to guarantee the lives of my extra pawns, and then unravel the rest of my pieces, and that move had not yet crossed my mind..  At the time I was imagining I'd play 26.Qc7, but after 26...Bd8 27.Qd6 Rxb2, Black would have been well back in the game, despite the pawn less.  Her superior bishop and active rook would have been enough to stay at least roughly on terms.} 26. Rxe7 {Now Black's game goes rapidly downhill.} Rxb2 27. a4 Rc8 28. Qd7 Rb1 {Hoping for 29.Rxb1?? ... when Black mates in two.  But I don't need to take the rook.  Somewhat better was to double rooks along the c-file 29...Rbc2 then pull back the advanced rook to defend Black's second rank: 30...R2c7.  } 29. Rxf7 Rf8 {No help - in fact it leaves White with a forced 3-move checkmate.  Better was carry on with a counter-attack plan (something I took care to calculate out, you betcha): 29...Rxf1ch 30.Kxf1 Qb1ch 31.Ke2 Qc2ch 32.Kf3 ... and as 32...Qe4ch 33.kg3 simply ran Black out of checks, 32...Rf8 33.Rxf8ch Kxf8 34.Qxe6 and wins.} 30. Rxg7+ Kh8 31. Rh7+ Kg8 32. Qg7# {Choosing a solid, unassuming defence, Black stayed on reasonable terms for most of the game, slipping a piece behind just at the moment when there was still much to play for.  Black best moments came during the course and immediate aftermath of White's attack on the Q-side that netted both a-pawns.  Two pawns behind, Black still had chances to make life difficult to for White - perhaps to hold the game.  Often the difference in player strength come down down simply to ... consistency.}
