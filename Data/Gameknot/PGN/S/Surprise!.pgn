[Opening "Philidor's defence (C41)"]

1. e4 {King's Pawn open.} e5 {King's Pawn game.} 2. Nf3 {Apparently called the King's Knight opening, but it's still fairly standard.} d6 {My standard defense in this situation.} 3. Bb5+ {I've never really been a fan of this move.  It seems like putting black just for the sake of saying "check."  While it may weaken the queen side defenses, I like Bc4 instead.} Bd7 {Protect the King and threaten the bishop.} 4. Bc4 {Now he's where he should be.} Nf6 {In hindsight, Be6 was probably a better move.  If he accepts, it's a simple BxB trade, and if he plays 4...Bd5+, I can follow it with 5.c6 and force his bishop back to d3 or farther.  But I guess this was a fine move.} 5. Ng5 {When I saw this move, I was kind of confused.  I've seen (and tried) the queen side fork many times, but this was the first time I've seen it tried king side.} h6 {Going to attack the knight.  I don't like it hanging out in such a forward position.} 6. Nxf7 {Crap.  I thought that my king had protected f7, but I didn't notice that the bishop was also threatening.  This could've been absolutely disastrous for me.} Qe7 {I felt like I had to save my queen if I wanted any chance to stay in this game.} 7. Nxh8 {There goes the rook.  Now he has a great material advantage, and this game could be over fairly quickly.} Nxe4 {I decide to get whatever material that I could get at this point.  It also puts my knight into a pretty good position to attack.} 8. Ng6 {Crap, another fork.  Really should've seen this coming...} Qf6 {Saving my queen a second time.  This time, I noticed that his king side was pretty unprotected, so I made a play for a quick mate.  If nothing else, I would at least get the knight.} 9. Nxf8 {I guess that he didn't notice the mate looming.  Now he's got a great material advantage, but material isn't everything.} Qxf2# {Mate.  This game is good to show the dangers of focusing too much on one or two pieces.  He was able to rack up a great advantage in material, but his defense was non-existent throughout.  I got lucky to win this one, and hopefully I won't get myself into this situation again any time soon.}
