1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. e3 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 {"Looking" at b2. Not a real threat, but it kind of force whit to play a defensive move. My b7 pawn is not weak, and I can't see a "trapped Q" set after Qxb2.} 6. Qc2 d6 {The downside of this move is dxc5. I'd taked with the Q, not to lose my central d pawn, which is controlling the d5 square. } 7. Nbd2 {Preparing for Nc4, with a tempo on my Q.} d5 {A little surprise. I "change" the whole asset of the opening by playing this pawn twice (which is bad, they say), and allowing e5 to his pieces. But he is just not prepared for a real strike on e5 now. } 8. h3 {? A pity. I'd prefer a stronger move. This just loses a tempo. I could have played Bd7, preparing Rc8. But...} cxd4 9. exd4 {This is the standard recapture (as white, I'd play this, too). But maybe it is not the best. White is dancing at my pace.} Bd7 10. Bd3 Rc8 {Here white has to play a3, but he...} 11. O-O Nb4 {I'll get rid of this strong lsb, as a minimum, and I'll be also threatening a B skewer.} 12. Qb1 Nxd3 13. Qxd3 Bb5 14. c4 dxc4 {Now the threat is c3 (after the Q moves). Which implies the Q has only a square...} 15. Qc3 Nd5 {...but now everything falls. Incredible! Does this apply for a miniature, dosen't it? 15 moves! Thanks for whatching!}
