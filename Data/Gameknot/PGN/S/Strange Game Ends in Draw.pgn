1. Nf3 b6 {Not a common response. Usually, black vies for the center with 2.d5 or plays 2.Nf6. Here black wants to compete with my fianchetto setup with one of his own. } 2. g3 Bb7 3. Bg2 Nc6 {I was a bit surprised at this move. I mean, what about your kingside? But maybe black wanted to castle queenside. But still, I think it would have been better to leave the diagonal open and put the knight on d7 later. } 4. O-O f6 {Another odd move to me. Maybe black was thinking of preparing an early pawn storm against my king, but in that case, maybe f5 was better. } 5. d3 e5 6. Nbd2 h5 {Black made a lot of pawn moves and did not develop pieces. Well anyways. it definitely looked like a pawn storm. } 7. e4 g5 {The pawn storm in full swing, but was I afraid? Not in the slightest - because black had not really developed any pieces on the kingside.} 8. Nc4 {My plan was to open up my dark-squared bishop and relocate my knight by Ne3-Nf5 with a nifty outpost. } Bh6 {Well, black finally develops another piece, but just to defend. } 9. d4 {Since black's king had not castled, I was trying to break open the center to get a few punches in his direction. And if that didn't work, I would apply pressure on e5 and the center in general. } Qe7 10. d5 {Misplacing the knight and blocking the diagonal for the bishop. } Nb4 11. a3 Na6 12. Be3 d6 13. Nfd2 {A sneaky move. I discover an attack on h5 and plan to make an f4 advance to break up his position. } Nb8 {Wants to relocate the knight with good reason, but completely misses my discovery attack. } 14. Qxh5+ Kd8 {Black has no castling capacity, his pieces are dismal, and he does not have much in the way of counterplay. I got really confident at this point and believed the game to be set in stone as a win for me. Lesson: don't play ego games with yourself - just play your best until its over. } 15. Qe2 a5 {A really good move. Its his best way to counteract my position. Before he could try to scare away the knight with b5, but I have a sweet spot on a5. But now, with this move, my sweet spot is gone. At this point, I should have secured a place for the knight. But.... instead I thought he was merely gaining space and doing nothing. In other words, I got lazy and didn't thoroughly analyze as I should have. } 16. Rae1 {Preparing for an attack starting with f4 - it covers the e4 pawn after multple exchanges. But, as I mentioned, I completely forgot about my knight hanging.... overconfidence kills, my friends. } b5 17. Nxd6 {I decide to take down something before I see the grave. } cxd6 18. Bb6+ Ke8 19. Qxb5+ {Well, you might say that it isn't all that bad for me. I got equal material and decent enough pieces. But really my position is awkward now, and black's situation is getting better. } Qd7 20. Qxd7+ {I exchange in light that I have three pawns for a piece, which can come in handy in the endgame, so I try to exchange pieces quickly. } Nxd7 21. Be3 Ba6 22. c4 Rc8 23. Rec1 a4 24. Bh3 g4 {An interesting decision. Black gives up a pawn to worsen my pawn structure and make my circumstance a bit worse. I don't know if it is the most sound move, but it was reasonably effective against me. I am a bit of a pawn muncher and love to secure slight advantages with extra pawns, so I was happy. } 25. Bxg4 Bxe3 26. fxe3 Rc7 27. Bd1 Nc5 28. Bc2 Rf7 29. Rf2 Nh6 30. h3 Ke7 31. Kg2 Rfh7 32. Rcf1 Ng8 {My attack does not have much merit - it is easily defended, though it looks slightly pretty. } 33. h4 Rf7 34. Kh3 {A waste of a move because....} Bc8+ 35. Kg2 Nh6 36. Nb1 Rhf8 {I don't have many options at this point. I decide to see if my knight is better somewhere else. } 37. Nc3 Bd7 38. Ne2 Nb3 39. Nc1 Ng4 40. Re2 Nxc1 41. Rxc1 {I was glad that knight was gone, because it looked menacing. Black could have played Rb8 instead of exchanging, but there is wasn't much reason for the pawn being on b3 anyways - it would probably become a target for attack. } Rc8 42. Bd1 Rc5 {At this point, I definitely have a losing position. Black's knight on g4 is glorious, his c-file attack is annoying, and I really don't have much to counteract it all. } 43. Rc3 Nh6 44. Rf2 f5 {I wanted to get rid of my doubled pawn, but exchanging on f5 would mean more activity for Black. } 45. Bc2 fxe4 46. Bxe4 Rxf2+ 47. Kxf2 Rc8 48. Ke2 Rb8 49. Rc2 Bf5 {A prudent move by black. This secures a great position for him and seeks to gain material. } 50. Kd3 {Another fault of mine. Clearly Kf3 would have been better, despite the pin on the rook, because I forgot about this move....} Rb3+ {When black played this, I got a little depressed. I was up a pawn in a bad position, which had some chances for me. Now it looked like I would be even in material with simply a poor position. Somehow, it completely slipped my mind that black could play this. } 51. Rc3 Rxb2 52. c5 {The only way I could create counterplay. } Rb3 {But I got lucky. Black played an inaccurate move. Much better was pawn takes pawn, black having tactics if I took on Rc5, i.e. 53. Rxc5 Rb3+ 54. Rc3 RxR winning the bishop. If Black would have taken the pawn, I would not take it back immediately. } 53. Rxb3 axb3 54. Bxf5 Nxf5 55. c6 b2 56. Kc2 Nxe3+ 57. Kxb2 Nxd5 58. h5 {Now the game is simplified, which is to my taste. I have threats to promote a pawn on both sides of the board. Theoretically, it is either win or a draw for me at this point, so I got my confidence back. } Kf6 59. a4 Nc7 60. Kc3 d5 61. a5 Kf5 62. g4+ {It would be nice to take the pawn, but that would mean I would promote, as the King would lose the race and the knight can't compete in it. } Kg5 63. Kd3 Na6 64. Ke3 Nc7 65. Kd3 {I tried for a while to see Black would make an inaccuracy, but he did not. I offered a draw at this point, as I saw through analysis that we would be shuffling pieces for another 20 moves completing nothing. A strange draw for sure - blunders, inaccuracies, and theoretically unsound ideas made for an odd game that somehow ended in a friendly way. }
