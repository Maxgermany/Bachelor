[Opening "French (C07), Tarrasch, open variation"]

1. e4 {The standard opening of masters in simuls everywhere, trying for an open game they can quickly win.} e6 {Ellison adopts a cautious approach.} 2. d4 {The book reply...} d5 {...and usual response.} 3. Nd2 {Kmoch takes a slow approach, keeping the way clear for P-QB3 to support his QP.} c5 {The amateur tries to crack Kmoch's center immediately.} 4. Ngf3 {Developing and guarding.} cxd4 {Opting to liquidate the center at once.} 5. Nxd4 {Recapturing and centralizing his Knight.} dxe4 {Finishing the central demolition.} 6. Nxe4 {Kmoch's Knights dominate the board.} Nf6 {Finally developing a piece.} 7. Bg5 {Developing with a pin. But Ellison will have none of that...} Qa5+ {...as he unpins with a check, and sets a subtle trap. White's correct response is 8 Q-Q2! [If Black then plays 8... B-N5, White can play 9 P-QB3, sealing the diagonal.]} 8. Bd2 {Kmoch makes a horrible blunder with this natural-looking response.} Qe5 {Ellison pounces. Kmoch resigns, as there is no way to avoid the outright loss of a piece.}
