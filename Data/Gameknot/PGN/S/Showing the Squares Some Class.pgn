1. d4 {I believe the name 'Mahesh' may refer to someone from the subcontinent, but I did not check.  I had been playing a lot of hasty chess, and I hadn't been showing them any class.  I enjoyed this game because I was able to get a small advantage and increase it, without slipping up, as I showed the squares some class.} d5 2. e3 {I know this move looks passive, and I have criticized it before, but since I don't like to play with fianchettoed bishops I often use the dark-squared bishop in a defensive role.} e6 3. c4 {A delayed c4.} c6 {The semi-slav.  Since I often play it as black, I remember many ways white can make it uncomfortable.} 4. cxd5 cxd5 5. Nc3 Qa5 {All the moves were standard until this Qa5.  I consider it quite a poor move given black's lack of development.  Maybe white is continually better after this absurd Qa5.} 6. Qc2 {Just preventing the queen sliding onto the b-file if after Qa5, bd2.} Bb4 7. Bd2 a6 8. a3 Bxc3 {So I am getting trading off the dark-squared bishop.  I had received some criticism in an earlier annotation after I referred to a bishop as "bad".  Here, even though it could occupy a useful role defensively, it is bad in comparison to black's more active bishop.} 9. Bxc3 Qd8 10. Nf3 h6 11. Bd3 Nf6 12. Ne5 {I saw nxf7 followed by bg6+, but didn't play it.} Nbd7 13. h3 Nh5 {Now nxf7 is on and white's going to be a pawn up.} 14. Nxf7 Kxf7 15. Bg6+ Ke7 16. Bb4+ {A classy move, drawing the king up the board.} Kf6 17. Bxh5 Nf8 18. Bxf8 Qxf8 19. Qg6+ Ke7 20. O-O {Maybe not the classiest continuation.  White maybe was better off with rc1.} Qf6 21. Qd3 {Even though I am a pawn up I would rather pressure his exposed king than to simplify.} b5 22. Rac1 Bd7 23. Rc7 Rac8 24. Rfc1 Rxc7 25. Rxc7 Rc8 26. Rxc8 Bxc8 27. Qc3 {And I think there's a big advantage to white.} Bd7 28. Qc5+ Kd8 29. Qb6+ {Winning more material.} Ke7 30. Qxa6 g6 31. Be2 e5 {Exposing an attack on the queen.  But it is easily defended.} 32. Bxb5 Qxa6 33. Bxa6 exd4 34. exd4 {White is now three pawns up in this won endgame.} g5 35. g4 Kd6 36. Kf1 Kc6 37. Ke2 Kb6 38. Bd3 Ka5 39. Kd2 Ka4 40. Kc3 Bb5 41. Bxb5+ Kxb5 42. b3 Ka5 43. a4 Kb6 44. b4 {And here he just resigned.  White is winning this easily.}
