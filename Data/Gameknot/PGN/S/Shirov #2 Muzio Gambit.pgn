[Opening "KGA (C37), double Muzio gambit"]

1. e4 {Shirov has punched with both hands: 1.d4 and 1.e4.  Whichever one he chooses Shirov always finds a way to create exciting attacks.} e5 2. f4 {And white's intentions are shown immediately, King's Gambit hasn't been popular for a long time, but it always manages to create attacking chances for white, whether it works out or not.} exf4 {Black accepts.  There is a common theme of black accepting material in this game and his position becoming more and more difficult to play.} 3. Nf3 {A less common alternative in 3.Bc4, immediately targeting f7.  However, that move allows 3... Qh4 which 3.Nf3 avoids.} g5 {Black defends his vulnerable pawn on f4.} 4. Bc4 {White aims his guns at f7.  f7 is black's most vulnerable square in the opening because the king is the ONLY defender of that square.} g4 5. O-O {Once again white ignores the material, he finishes his development instead.} gxf3 6. Qxf3 {White lines up on the f file.} Qf6 {Black discourages regaining the pawn on f4.  White can't retake because if queens are traded white's attack will dissipate.} 7. e5 {7.e5!  White plays to open up files, and he sacrifices pawns with gain of tempo for the sake of opening up the e file against black's king.} Qxe5 {Once again, black accepts the material, once again this is a perfectly reasonable response and once again black's position becomes more and more difficult to play.  The only piece that's black has developed is his queen.  On the other hand white has three pieces in the game and some open files to work with.  All he needs to do now is turn black's king into an even bigger bullseye and bring his remaing pieces out.} 8. Bxf7+ {First white draws out black's king.} Kxf7 {White is left with a challenging question, how do you bring the undeveloped pieces into the attack?  It's hard to do, he needs to develop while not giving black a chance to recuperate from the tactical blows white keeps on throwing out.  Take a second to look for a way to develop, it's a clever solution.} 9. d4 {Then he opens up the game with gain of time.} Qxd4+ {And black (as always) accepts.  According to theory I've seen, 9... Qf5! slowing white's opening up of the game is stronger.} 10. Be3 { A stunner!  White develops with tempo and the bishop cannot be taken.  If 10... Qxe3 11.Qxe3 and the pawn is pinned to the king.} Qf6 {For the first time black doesn't grab.  If 10... Qxb2 11.Qxf4  leads to a decisive attack for white.} 11. Bxf4 {White's bishop is attacked, so he takes back the pawn and now the f file is free of pawns...} Ke8 {So black flees the file, white has a great rook on the f file but he's now needs to bring his other one to the e file.} 12. Nc3 {White develops, the rooks are now connected and the second one will soon come to the e file.} Nc6 13. Nd5 {But before playing Rae1  he gives the queen a tickle while pressuring c7 and e7.} Qg6 14. Rae1+ {And somehow, all of white pieces are in the attack, and black has only developed one besides his queen.} Be7 15. Bd6 {An incredible move!  The bishop cannot be taken because Qf8# is mate (the bishop's pinned to the king).} Kd8 {Black flees but this allows a spectacular conclusion.  See if you can find a nice mate... then look for a better one.} 16. Qf8+ {And the obvious mate is 16... Bxf8 17.Rxf8  Qe8 18.Rexe8# or 18.Rfxe8#} Bxf8 17. Bxc7# {A nice finish.  It's rare to see a game where white mates after 17 moves when he's only taken 4 pawns and is down -14 in material.  I hope you enjoyed this toss back to the old school style of attack from the super GM Shirov.  If you have any thoughts, criticisms, variations, don't hesitate to PM me.  I'm thinking of doing a series of analyzed games on an opening, if anyone has any exciting variations you'd like to see a pretty game in please PM me about it.}
