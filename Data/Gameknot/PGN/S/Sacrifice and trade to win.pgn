[Opening "Sicilian (B51), Canal-Sokolsky (Nimzovich-Rossolimo, Moscow) attack"]

1. e4 {Good, sharp opening.  WAstes no time setting up a position in the centre.  One of the most standard openings, and one of Bobby Fischer's favourites is the e4.  Grabs space right in the middle, opens up white's LSB and queen.} c5 {So I respond with the Sicilian.  Other possible responses are 2...e5 for a sharp, exciting game, or 2...Nc6.  Still, the Sicilian is one of the more common responses to the king pawn opening.} 2. Nf3 {Now asserting control over the dark squares, supplementing the light square pawn on e4.  Other responses might have been Nc3, which reinforces grab on light square in teh centre.  The pawn is not protected, but since I'm not threatening it, white continues to develop his pieces.} d6 {I think this is the Taimanov Sicilian, but I'm not sure.  Still, trying to keep it conservative.  Note that my dark bishop is totally hemmed in on this side, so I'll have to fianchetto it.  Still, this is so far, pretty standard play on both sides.  Another response might be 2...Nc6.  Note that 2...Nf6 attacking the pawn would be bad, as 3. e5 has a defended pawn, and my knight would have to run around.  2...d6 is necessary for ...Nf6.} 3. Bb5+ {Sharp play, basically calling for the bishop trade, or for me to lose my knight for his bishop.  Strange to check so early, but not that there's anything wrong with it.} Nc6 {I do this odd move again and again, it seems.  I'll have to stop.  This doesn't threaten the bishop, and just wastes time for me, since I'll have to unpin my knight later.} 4. O-O {Castles at leisure, although probably could have developed Nc3, d3, b3, or even d4 instead, since I'm nowhere near a counterattack.} a6 {Putting the question to the bishop.} 5. Bxc6+ {My knight dies.  I'm still exerting influence over the dark squares in the middle from my pawns though.  This brings up one of the common debates in chess.  Which is better, the bishop or the knight?  The Ruy Lopez basically prefers the knight in the opening, but it's far from settled.  Still, from this move, white seems to be more comfortable playing down a bishop.} bxc6 {On the plus side, this opens the b file.  On the negative side, I have doubled pawns. Still, now I have pawn control over the d5 square, which I wouldn't have had otherwise.} 6. c4 {The Maroczy wall, asserting control over the d5 square.  Still, this opens up a potential outpose on d4, if his knight ever moves.  My knight that could have got to that outpost easiest is dead, however.} e5 {Reassert centre control, and exerts influence over f4.} 7. Nc3 {This isn't necessarily bad, but it's unclear what this knight is supposed to do.  It can't really go anywhere from there, and this move wasn't necessary to develop other pieces.  Might have made more sense to do 7. b3, setting up the fianchetto.} g6 {So I take advantage to set up my own fianchetto.  however, it's a bit weak, as my own pawn is blocking my DSB influence on the long diagonal.} 8. d3 {now his DSB is activated, although there is still a hole on d4.  White should keep his DSB at this point, as his centre pawns are mostly on light squares.} Bg7 {Complete the fianchetto.} 9. Bd2 {Not clear what this accomplishes.  White may be making a break for the queenside, since this doesn't gain any new influence for the bishop.  Certainly the rook isn't moving to c1.} Nf6 {Getting ready to castle.} 10. h3 {Stops ...Bg4, if I was interested.  } O-O 11. a3 {Possibly in anticipation of b4 cxb4 which opens up one of the files for white's rook.} Rb8 {So I take the half open file first.} 12. Rb1 {Now white's defending the half-open file.  More action is now on the Queenside.} Be6 {Done in anticipation of ...d5, to open up the centre.} 13. Ng5 {Threatens my LSB, and possible fork of Queen and rook, unless I take with pawn.  However, doing so would compromise my pawn shield.} Qd7 {Keeps centre control, links rooks, and defends LSB without risking my pawn shield.} 14. f4 {Nice.  Opens up a flank attack against the centre, which also will open up space for his rook on the f-file.} d5 {Damn the torpedoes!  Full speed ahead!  I'm taking out his centre.  I'm hoping to make a push Queenside.} 15. fxe5 {Ouchie.  My knight is threatened.  Still, I can get a pawn for it.  I figure take the e4 pawn, which will let me use that DSB at last to take the pawn on e5.  After this, I will be down even more material.} Nxe4 16. dxe4 dxe4 {This opens up space for my LSB, which after taking the pawn on c4, will allow me to attack white's defending rook, and possibly get it off that half open f-file, which is a potential threat to me.} 17. Ncxe4 {Now I'm still down a piece.  Still, my bishops are going right through the centre, so it would be a shame not to get rid of those white pawns, innit?  White could also move his/her DSB to c3 after this, protecting that pawn on e5, and offering up a queen trade.  Since white is ahead in material, this would be a good play.  A general principle of chess, is to trade pieces when you're ahead.} Bxc4 {Threatens his rook, which will allow me to take the e5 pawn in piece.  Stops white from moving DSB, since s/he has to focus on the rook atm.} 18. Rf2 {Rook stays on the half-open f file.  Only othe rplace was the e-file, which is also half open, but has a knight on it.} Bxe5 {Takes that pawn, also removes h2 square for white.  Would like to place the bishop directly on g3, but it is attacked by the e4 knight.} 19. b4 {I'm guessing this is an attempt to open the b file for white's rook.  I do not want a trade, as I am down a piece (although I'm ahead in pawns for the moment).} Rbd8 {Now, I'm doubly attacking the white queen.  If that bishop moves, I'm thinking something like 20.Be4? Qxd1  21.Rxd1 Rxd1 .  Of course, I don't actually expect white's DSB to move, but I'm applying pressure down the centre now.  Also, whites f file rook can't offer much protection to the queen atm, since my LSB is attacking his available squares.} 20. Rf6 {Not sure why this move.  The rook isn't going anywhere that I can see from here.  Seems to be tempting me to take it with the DSB, which would lead to a devastating Queen-King check from the e4 knight.  Nice try, but I am NOT moving that bishop.  This, however, means my queen and king are on dangerous ground.} Qd4+ {So I prevent the forking attack, although I am still exposed here to Ne6, attacking both rooks.  However, that would lead to cancelling white's piece advantage for me, after ...fxe6} 21. Rf2 {Returns the rook, which technically wastes a tempo for white.} Bd3 {Now, I'm thinking I have to get rid of white's knights, which are in bad positions for me.  Too many forking opportunities have come up.  I imagine he'll save the rook, which would allow me to take ...Bxe4.} 22. Nxc5 {Nope, he wants that knight after all.  Still, now it's not defending the g3 square!  My DSB is suddenly in a dangerous position for him.  Seems white was thinking 23. Ne4 to fork the rooks, but that would lead to 23. Ne4 fxe4 24. Nxe4 Qxf2   25.Kh1 Rxd2, which would be a huge advantage for me.} Bxb1 {So, what the hell, take the rook, attempt to even out the material disadvantage.  Suddenly, one of the king's defenders is missing.} 23. Qxb1 {My LSB served its purpose, now it is dead.} Bg3 {Now I can get to that square, and get rid of that rook.  Possible defenses for white here are Qf1, Qe1 and... I think that's it.  That rook is dead.  I'm not fearing the attempted fork at Ne6, because I'm taking that rook on the next play.} 24. Nb3 {now this is just strange, and is a blunder in my opinion.  Now the fork at Ne6 is a foregone possibility, and the rook is still dead.} Qxf2+ {Like so.  Now, with my bishop at g3, the possibility of a back rank mate is open.  But I have to get rid of one of those defenders.  I can't just take that DSB with my rook though, since the knight is defending it.  Also, I'm currently in danger of a fork at Ne4.} 25. Kh1 Rfe8 {Now I'm set to take the bishop, and threaten ...Re1 , which at the least would allow me to take white's queen.} 26. Ne4 {The threatened fork. I guess white didn't see my rook.} Rxe4 {Die, knight.} 27. Nc5 {Another key defender gone.  Still, this threatens a fork of the queen and DSB at e4 again, unless I mate before hand.} Qxd2 {Here, I sacrifice the rook (more accurately, trade it for the bishop), knowing that afterwards I can mate on the back rank.  Now, the only possible defense for white is Qf1 or Qg1, and that would be temporary.  My response after that would be Re-e1.} 28. Nxe4 {Nope, the rook was too tempting.  No matter, time for the back rank mate.} Qd1+ {Forcing the take with the queen.  The knight is no help here.  After this move, white resigned.}
