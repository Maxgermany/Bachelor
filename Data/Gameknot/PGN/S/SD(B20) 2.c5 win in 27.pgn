1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {Sicilian Defence, Bowlder Attack} e6 {To prevent the white b from hitting f7} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6 {In order to prevent the white B from checking after moving the d pawn to d5(which is the next move in fact.)  } 5. a4 {preventing ...b5 and then ...Bb7 thus controlling the long white diagonal(also another reason why 4...a6 was played)} d5 6. exd5 exd5 7. Qe2+ {a mistake? Could anyone pls. comment?} Be7 8. Ba2 Nc6 {played with the aim of restricting white(see 11...cxd4)} 9. h3 O-O {putting the k to safety } 10. O-O {same conclusion} Nd4 11. Nxd4 {11. Qd1 is a better move although white would still be constricted} cxd4 {the start of whites' constriction(see 8...Nc6)} 12. Nd1 Re8 {thus controlling the e file.} 13. d3 {with the aim of releasing the b from c1} Bd6 14. Qf3 Qc7 15. Bxd5 Nxd5 16. Qxd5 Rd8 {A quaint little trap is sprung on white. } 17. Qb3 {another mistake?(the q is out of place in the q-side) this prevents black from going thru with his quaint little trap.} Re8 18. c4 {Maybe white is hoping that black would attack this pawn en passant.} Re2 {the start of black rook domination of the e file} 19. f4 {white is desperate to put on a semblance of defense for his k} Bd7 {In order to control the long white diagonal} 20. Rf2 Re1+ {The beginning of whites' rapid deterioration.} 21. Kh2 Rae8 {thus controlling the e file} 22. g3 {white is in virtual zugzwang position due to the black pawn on d4. the white knight has nowhere to go.} Bc6 23. g4 Rh1+ 24. Kg3 Ree1 {thus controlling the back rank, too} 25. Bd2 Reg1+ 26. Kh4 g5+ 27. fxg5 {if 27. Kxg5 be7ch and white is still in big trouble.} Bg3+ {the reason for 14...Qc7!!!? White resigned.}
