[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 {I always like Morphy's defense against the Ruy Lopez. It gives Black the best chance to fight on.} 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {I was somewhat surprised by this. White doesn't often play the Exchange variation.} 5. d3 Bd6 6. b3 Bg4 7. h3 Bh5 8. g4 {This also came as a surprise. I didn't think White would weaken his K-side Pawns when he wants to castle there.} Bg6 9. O-O Qd7 10. Nh4 {White wins back the minor exchange.} Ne7 11. Nxg6 Nxg6 12. Nd2 O-O {The opening is completed now, as both sides have castled. I didn't see much in this position for either side.} 13. Nc4 Bb4 14. a3 Bc3 {I was trying to avoid exchanging my remaining Bishop for White's Knight.} 15. Rb1 Nf4 {I'm trying to keep White from gaining a space advantage. His Pawns, especially on the K-side, are positioned well for that strategy.} 16. Bd2 Bxd2 17. Qxd2 {Another exchange, and now with the wood reduced even if he gains a space advantage I have nothing to be cramped.} f6 18. Qe3 b6 {I'm solidifying my Pawn position against any attacks.} 19. Kh2 Rfe8 20. Nd2 Rad8 {At this point, a draw would be in order. Neither side has any real attacking chances. But I seem to be one of the very few people on GK who's comfortable with a draw... everyone else has to be dragooned into one.} 21. Nf3 Qd6 22. b4 Qe6 23. Rb2 Kh8 24. Nh4 g6 {As it turned out, this move was very important later in the game. At the time, I was just trying to restrict my opponent's space and force him into accepting a draw.} 25. Ng2 Nxg2 26. Kxg2 {The last minor pieces vanish.} Kg7 27. f4 Qd6 28. fxe5 Qxe5 {Position is still very even.} 29. Rfb1 Ref8 30. a4 Rdb8 31. c4 {I was hoping somewhere along the line White would play P-QN5?, enabling me to undouble my Pawns.} Rfd8 32. Rd2 Rd7 33. d4 Qe6 34. Rc1 Qe7 {Slow maneuvering. Neither side seems willing to force the pace hereabouts...} 35. c5 b5 36. axb5 axb5 {The QR file is now open. But the position is still stagnant. Now I'm hoping for White to play P-Q5?, again enabling me to undouble my Pawns.} 37. Ra1 Rdd8 38. Ra6 Qe8 39. Qf4 Rbc8 {Now White zeroes in on the doubled QB-pawns. I defend, but at this point losing one of the doubled Pawns won't affect my position much, as they don't have the effect of more than a single Pawn anyway.} 40. Ra7 Rd7 41. e5 {White gives up on the doubled Pawns for a moment and instead aims to create a passed K pawn.} fxe5 42. dxe5 Rxd2+ {He gets his passed Pawn, but at the cost of vaporizing a pair of Rooks.} 43. Qxd2 Kh8 44. Qf4 Qe7 {I have effectively blockaded the position. Even if White wins the P on my QB3, the Q-side Pawns will remain obstructed.} 45. Qf6+ Qxf6 46. exf6 {The Queens are next to fall. Now the importance of ...P-KN3 becomes clear. White cannot support his KB pawn's further advance with P-KN6, and thus the KB pawn cannot reach the 7th rank safely.} Kg8 47. g5 Kf7 {The Pawn is blockaded again. White will be unable to break through.} 48. Ra6 Rd8 49. Rxc6 Rc8 50. Ra6 c6 {I let the doubled Pawn fall, as it is now irrelevant. Unless White can get his K in a position to support the KBP, he has no winning chances at all.} 51. Ra7+ Kg8 52. Re7 Rf8 {With only the Rook in support, the Pawn is frozen on KB6.} 53. Re6 Rc8 54. Kf3 {White finally tries to bring his King forward. But the P on KN3 cuts off the K-side entry squares.} Kf7 55. Re1 Rd8 56. Re7+ Kg8 57. Rc7 Rd4 58. Rxc6 Rxb4 {White exchanges a pair of Q-side Pawns, simplifying the game but not making any progress.} 59. Rb6 Kf7 60. Kg2 Rb3 61. c6 Rc3 {Inviting White to exchange the last of the Q-side Pawns.} 62. Rxb5 Rxc6 {He accepts.} 63. Rb3 Rc5 {I aim to remove the supporting Pawn on KN5 and capture White's KBP.} 64. Rb7+ Kg8 65. Rg7+ Kf8 {White is out of checks. I'm more than willing to trade my KRP for his KNP.} 66. Rxh7 Rxg5+ {Now I have the initiative because of the check, which will enable me to capture the KBP.} 67. Kh2 Rf5 {It's all over but the shouting.} 68. f7 Rxf7 {Draw finally agreed. My opponent could have taken it much earlier, but apparently he's allergic to draws. A long and hard-fought game.}
