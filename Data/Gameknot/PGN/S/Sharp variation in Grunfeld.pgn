1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 {A quiet move aimed at postponing the sharp struggle for control of the center, or so I thought} Bg7 5. Qa4+ {An interesting and disruptive move} Bd7 {The sharpest reply} 6. Qb3 dxc4 {I think Black is alright here, his position is rock solid and if White gets too greedy, it might cost him dearly.} 7. Bxc4 O-O 8. Qxb7 Bc6 {The point of Black's 5th move.} 9. Qb3 Bxg2 {Material, always good to have it.} 10. f3 {Still thinking with greed and not realizing the dangers of his position, but it's too late already.} Bxh1 11. Qb7 {A waste of time.} Nbd7 12. Qc6 e5 {Opening lines to take advantage of the uncastled king.} 13. Ne4 Nxe4 14.
