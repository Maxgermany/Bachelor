[Opening "Caro-Kann (B12), advance variation"]

1. e4 c6 {Caro kann, which I play a lot as black.  I had studied quite a bit for this opening in order to play it, or to play against it.} 2. d4 d5 3. e5 {The advance variation, which is one of the sharper options according to most databases.  I spent a while deciding on this variation, considering also the panov-botvinnik attack in the exchange lines, which I think I will try in the future.} c5 {This offers to transpose into a French Defense perhaps, and plays an early c5 to undermine d4, with the idea of if dxc then maybe Qa5+ with the semi open c file and a nice spot for the queen on c7 after Be3} 4. Nf3 cxd4 {Certainly not the only move, developing the lsb before closing the pawn chain is to be considered too} 5. Nxd4 {Objectionable I think, the pawn has no future with two attackers and no defensive resources available.  I considered developing Nbd2 to b3 with a strongly posted knight on d4.  This move opens up the Queen to access the light diagonal on the KS for hopes of a Qg4 if the bishop leaves its defense of g7} e6 {This is a French Defense type transposition now, locking in the lsb of black.} 6. Bd3 {A natural square for the bishop, preparing to castle if desired.   Nbd2 again possible or maybe the fianchettoing of the dsb to eye the KS.} Bc5 7. Nb3 {This is questionable.  I do not think in retrospect that this knight belongs on b3, but it gains the tempo on black's valued dsb and forces the question of which diagonal it shall possess.  It stakes out control of d4 still} Bb6 8. Qg4 {An aggressive move recommended by Dzindzichashvili in some of his interesting Bd2 lines against the Winnawer pin on the c3 knight in the advance French, it makes sense to play this now that the bishop has committed itself away from the defense of the pawn and g6 is an awkward weakening of the dark squares on black's KS. } Ne7 {I saw the chance for the following: Qxg7 Rg8 Qxh7 Rxg2 Be3 Bxe3 fxe3 and the position is jumbled a bit with doubled e pawns for white but the outside passed h pawn.  White will castle QS and pursue KS initiative now that  it is opened.    White has good control on d4, but the position is unclear in my mind, at least so it was otb.} 9. Bg5 {!? The idea is simple, though perhaps not to be recommended.  I made it in the mindset of a quick attack, though it really just gives tempi to black in his defense which gets hi pieces to agreeable squares and allows him the development lead} Nbc6 {The obvious defense to Bxe7 Qxe7 Qxg7, where the rook is attacked} 10. Bb5 {? This is just a bad move, and commits the lsb to a poor diagonal.  It allows and encourages Bd7, developing black's lsb naturally.  This is the second time this bishop has moved in the opening, so for beginners this should be made a special note of how not to play the opening.  Better wa s Nbd2 with ideas of castling long and after h6 most likely Bxe7 to save the tempo as it would be awkward to retreat the bishop, and on h5 the same response most likely as the one to h6, with some slight danger because of Bxf2+ not Kxf2 for then Qb6+ winning white's queen.  The threat by black's knight against e5 is temporarily blunted by the pin, but this is a quick fix and soon white finds himself tied up by his own initiative.} Bd7 11. Bxc6 {? Better was maybe Bxe7 Nxe7 Bxd7+ Qxd7 Qxg7 or Nbd2 and maybe even f4 in the immediate future.  This commits giving away the bishop pair for absolutely nothing (the way I play it, which is a good note to the beginner as well, don't give away the bishop pair, note even for a pawn or even two pawns in an open position).  } Bxc6 12. Bxe7 {??  Though this allows white to grab the g pawn without the Rg7 retort it overlooks Qxe7 Qxg7 O-O-O!} Qxe7 13. Qxg7 O-O-O {Black is clearly winning despite the temporary pawn deficit} 14. Qf6 {?  This worsens white's game considerably as now he can not contest any diagonals at all and will be quickly zugzwanged} Qxf6 15. exf6 Bb5 {Gripping down total control against white's helpless KS.} 16. Nb1d2 {The move that is finally played far too late.  THe knights are entirely useless against the bishops's long piercing scopes} Rhg8 17. g3 Rg6 18. f4 Rxf6 19. O-O-O {I calculated this potential position and saw how cramped and horribly in black's favor it was, but still saw some fighting hope.} Kb8 20. Kb1 {Avoiding the pin perhaps to allow the knight some mobility in the future.} Re8 21. Rhe1 {To allow Nf3 because if immediately played it runs into Be2! winning the knight} Rg6 22. Nf3 {Looking for a decent home and some play on the KS} Bf2 23. Re5 {Committing to the following idea} f6 24. f5 {!?} fxe5 25. fxg6 e4 26. Nfd4 {This I calculated as ok for white as it gives chances with the soon to be passed pawn on the seventh, but it perhaps misjudges black's passed pawn.  I saw this chance to place the knight well on d5  to win the tempo on the lsb.  White has gained some space and hope though he is still losing} Bc4 27. g7 e3 28. Nxe6 {!} e2 29. Re1 {??  Much better was Rh1 this doesn't even get the pawn, white would still have a hope because of his passed pawn after Rh1 maybe.  It has already been said this is my worst game of chess..   From there: Rh1 e1=Q+ Rxe1 Bxe1 Nbd4! (blocking the d pawn so that the knight on e6 can block the rook, making Rg8 suggested which would then create b3 and Ng5 to folow with the idea of Ne7 to at least get some compensation)  Maybe white can make chances with his passed pawn although his back rank is still weak.  From here it is hopelessly lost.} Bxe1 30. Nbd4 Bb4 31. Nf3 {Desperate measures...} e1=Q+ 32. Nxe1 Bxe1 33. Nf8 d4 34. Nd7+ Kc7 35. Nf6 Re2 36. b3 Bc3 {0-1 White resigned for the mate in two threat.  A good lesson to all beginners on how not to treat your minor pieces and the dangers of otb emotions, tiredness and sick play.  A display to all others of how we can be capable of playing far below our ratings (I would give this a performance rating of 900-1000 for the sequence of positional play after ...Ne7, even with some of the tactical tries I gave myself).  A horrible showing and a game I shant soon forget.  Here's to not playing like sh*t again!}
