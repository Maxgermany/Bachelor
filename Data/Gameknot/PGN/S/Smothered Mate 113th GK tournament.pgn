[Opening "Queen's pawn game (E10)"]

1. d4 {My opponent gave me a hard fight, but I managed to see the opportunity for a Smothered Mate, and it got there.  So, this annotation describes what to look for in setting up a SM. The game starts with my usual opening, d4.  Typically, I play a Stonewall (e3 after ....d5 and then setting up a pawn structure with pawns at c3, d4, e3, and f4 with an outpost for the KN at e5).    Here, I see I went into something that I am, frankly, less familiar with.  [DEAR READER:  I MADE A MISTAKE AND ANNOTATED AS IF I WERE PLAYING WHITE.... I DISCOVERED THE ERROR AT MOVE 11 OR SO AND CHANGED THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE NARRATIVE AT THAT POINT.]} Nf6 {He might be going for some sort of Nimzo Indian.} 2. c4 {Queens Gambit.  I studied it 40 years ago or more (I'm 65), and play it by instinct and feel.  The last time I read a chess book was quite a while ago.} e6 3. Nf3 d5 {White would love it if Black chose to trade his d pawn for White's c pawn.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 5. Bd2 {Unpinning immediately.  One of the most important lessons I learned in chess -- and in life -- is "make necessary moves first."  (like castling)} O-O {Black read my mind.} 6. e3 c5 {Black adds tension to the Centre.  (I spelled it the old fashioned way on purpose.)} 7. dxc5 {As I play this back, now, I'm wondering what I was thinking?  I would have thought Be2 or Bd3 would be better.  It could be preferable to leave the center tension where it is, and get my King safely castled ASAP.} Bxc5 8. Bd3 dxc4 9. Bxc4 {After this series of exchanges, the center is half open, White is prepared to castle, and seems better developed overall.  } Nc6 10. O-O a6 {Perhaps Black just doesn't want White to take a stab at occupying b5, or perhaps he intends b7-b5.   White doesn't like his Bishop on d2, or the unprotected Bishop on c4.  } 11. e4 {Hmmmm.  I don't remember exactly why I made this move.  Maybe it was to give the d2 Bishop some scope, or to control d5 and/or to push d4-d5. It does all of those things.  Oops.  A funny thing just happened:  I just realized that I am BLACK in this game!    Oh well.  I will now continue the annotation from Black's perspective.} Nd4 {Brilliant!  Puts pressure on the Kingside defense.} 12. Be3 Nxf3+ 13. Qxf3 {Black removes a key defender, and lures the Q to a less than optimal spot.  } Bxe3 14. fxe3 {This must be a mistake.  To have doubled e pawns is a long-term, permanent liability.  White should have retaken with the Queen.  } Qc7 {Of course.  This makes the d file available for a Rook, and makes White do something about the loose Bishop.  A problem for Black is the undeveloped Bishop and QR.} 15. b3 {The aesthetics of White's position is not good, and the pawn defense of the B worsens this impression.  The Bishop, on the a2-g8 diagonal is "biting on granite," as they say, would have been better off defending the pawn on e4 ("over protection")} e5 {Makes room for the Queen Bishop with a very powerful move obviously planned.} 16. Rad1 Bg4 {The point.} 17. Nd5 {A little tit for tat.  This position gives the players a lot of things to think about.} Nxd5 18. Qxg4 Nxe3 {A pawn is a pawn.  The Knight is put to good effect here.} 19. Rd7 {Now the formation of the Smothered Mate possibility appears!  The diagonal is open to the King, a Knight is in the vicinity.  When this plan comes to fruition, it is a beautiful thing to behold! } Qc5 {The Queen takes the key diagonal with the intention of a Queen sacrifice in the not-too-distant future.  What makes this especially nice is the threat of a discovered check, with the simultaneous threat of NxQ.} 20. Bxf7+ {A spite check move in desperation.  Still, White's arsenal looks imposing:  A Q bearing down on g7, checked by the Bishop, Two Rooks converging on f7.  Once Black takes the Bishop, White cannot deliver a check and so must do something about his Queen.} Rxf7 21. Qe6 {Strong and powerful, and I imagine White felt very confident of a denoument in his favor in the next move or two.  Instead....} Ng4+ 22. Kh1 Nf2+ {White cannot take the Knight because of Q-c1.} 23. Kg1 Nh3+ {A discovered DOUBLE CHECK, a key move in the SM ballet.} 24. Kh1 Qg1+ {So unexpected!} 25. Rxg1 Nf2# {Very beautiful.  I never would have come to this move sequence had I not read about it somewhere.    Readers' comments are warmly invited.}
