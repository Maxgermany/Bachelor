[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {This game does have a bit in it. The development of the Sicilian defence, which I feel is pretty sound. A sacrifice that was executed incorrectly (thankfully) and a forced mate. } e6 {The start of the French defence. The French is a solid and resilient opening, though it can result in a cramped game for Black in particular the opening. Black often gains counterattacking possibilities on the queen side while White tends to attack the king side.   } 2. Nf3 c5 {The Sicilian is usually played 1. e4, c5 however i was thinking of playing the french when I started the match. } 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nc6 {Named after Mark Taimanov. Black develops the knight to a natural square and keeps his options open regarding the placement of his other pieces. One of the ideas of this system is to develop the bishop to b4 or c5. White can prevent this by 5.Nb5 d6. Taimanov's idea was to play 5...a6 (preventing Nb5) followed by ...Nge7 and ...Nxd4. Then when White recaptures with the queen, Black can attack it with ...Nc6, gaining time. A more popular setup involves ...Qc7, ...a6 and ...Nf6: this is often called the Paulsen Variation. } 5. Nc3 {Alot of players play a6 from here i personally feel this is an unnecessary move (there is nothing wrong with it, just my opinion) as per previous note the idea is to play a6 after Nb5, so no need to play this at the moment therefore other lines can be explored. } d6 {This now prevents Bc5/b4 without Nb5 so a6 will now be a move that can be used to move Nb5 or Bb5 with tempi if presented. } 6. Be3 Nf6 7. f3 a6 {This is now played as a part of the mainline opening for B80 Sicilian Scheveningen, including the english This is one of Black's most ambitious lines. This offers excellent counter attacking chances as well as scope for creativity. The pawn center of d6-e6 gives Black control of the critical d5 and e5 squares and retains flexibility to break in the center with either ...e5 or ...d5.   } 8. Qd2 Be7 {This is the last book move however both white and black have a few more moves to make to get to full development. } 9. Bc4 O-O 10. O-O-O Bd7 11. h4 b5 {This now gives Black a slight advantage in the game as now Whites bishop is forced to move by the advancing pawn. Looking in to this had white played 10. 0-0 Ne5 11. Be2 Qc7 results in the position being equal, perhaps white doesnt like the kingside pawn structure being disrupted or the strategy was to conduct a king side pawn storm which will be strengthened by the rooks. } 12. Bb3 b4 13. Nce2 Na5 {13...., a5!? is a better alternative 14. Nxc6, Bxc6 black still has intiative. Although the move played is not a bad one. 14. Qxb4?, d5 15.Qd2, dxe4 black is in a much better position than white.  } 14. g4 e5 15. Nf5 {Putting knight in a tricky position forcing the swap with a bishop! } Nxb3+ 16. cxb3 {The other alternative which i feel is a better one is 16. axb3 Bxf5 17. exf5 the game is equal and whites queen side is defended, where as now blacks advantage is the exposed king on the C file which white will have to move to keep safe and defend the a2 pawn. } Bxf5 {Taking care of whites Knight now as opposed to Nxe7 which will give time back to white.  } 17. gxf5 {White now shows his intentions. The queen side castling leads to the pawn storm backed up with rooks. Feel exf5 is better though as the pawns can storm on where now they are held up. The lure of an open file for the rook must have been too much to turn down. } Qa5 18. Kb1 d5 {Black has the initiative and is now pressing white. White does have a potentially good attack on blacks king side however at this moment black is better. } 19. Rdg1 Rfd8 {? should have played 19...kh8 20. Nc1 Rg8. This terrible move should undo all blacks good work, what was I thinking??? } 20. Rxg7+ {??  White lets black off the hook with a huge mistake, had white played 20.Bh6 g6 21. h5 dxe4 22.hxg6 fxg6 23.Rxg6  Kf7 24. Qg5 white is in a far better position and the game is surely belongs to white. } Kxg7 {Now white is in trouble and can only attempt the draw which will be very hard, keeping blacks king moving. } 21. Bh6+ Kh8 {Thats the king safe and black can concentrate on attack which will finish off an already won game. } 22. Ng3 {When looking at this I thought 22. Rg1 would help, however Rg8 23. Bg5 dxe4  it does not and it doesn't change what is in store for white. } dxe4 23. Qe3 exf3 24. Qxf3 Qd5 {A calculated gamble with white being down he will be wanting to hold onto pieces, if queen is moved white gives black a winning position. } 25. Qf1 {The start of the end. 25. Qxd5 is better but doesnt solve anything as 25..., Rxd5 26. Bg5, Rad8. } Ng4 {Bg5 and Bc1 only choices, Bg5 is more likley as Bc1 limits the bishops options and does not help with anything after 26. Bc1, Rac8 27. Qe2, Qd3  28.Qxd3, Rxd3. } 26. Bg5 {Expected. My idea was 26..., Bxg5 27. hxg5, Ne3 (perhaps a miss by white playing Qh3 threatening mate) the 28..., Qd1 29. Rxd1 Rxd1# If that doesn't materialise no great problem as black is in control. } Bxg5 27. hxg5 Ne3 28. Qg1 {there goes blacks last chance of counter play, 28. Qe2 is better, Qd3  29. Qxd3, Rxd3 30. Rc1, and has now giving white the win with forced mate from this position. } Qd3+ 29. Ka1 Nc2+ 30. Kb1 Ne1+ {Black resigns and does not allow the finish of 31. Ka1 Qd1# or 31. Kc1, Qc2#      An interesting game, mistakes by both players. Blacks Rfd8, as called, was a mistake which should have been exploited by white. Whites rook sacrifice was the blunder which allowed black in for the clinical finish. A game decided on the 19th and 20th moves. I was happy with the result and the opening. However I think I will need to study the opening a bit more as my 19th move was a shocker and should have been seen by both myself and opponent.       Hope you enjoyed the game. Any comments are welcome.      Cheers,      David. }
