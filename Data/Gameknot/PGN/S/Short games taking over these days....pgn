1. b4 {A risky opening, in my opinion.} e5 {Threatening the pawn, usually played here is 2. Bb2 threatening the e-pawn, but this opponent played...} 2. g4 {2. g4?! Inaccuracy, as it loses a pawn.} Bxb4 {Yum yum} 3. a4 {I felt like he* was a beginner at that time, looked at his** pass game history, and saw that there were plenty stalemates with huge material advantage, this dude is weird...  *or she **or her} Bc5 {Aiming at f2!} 4. h4 {Yes, he is definitely a beginner.} Qf6 {Just playing around here, I knew he probably would not fall for it.} 5. h5 {I was oh-so-wrong. What is he* thinking?  *or she} Qxf2# {Checkmate.}
