1. e4 {An OTB game which I would like to annotate firstly because I am unclear about some moves and would appreciate any explanations regarding those, secondly because of the somewhat odd finish, caused purely by psychology, and thirdly since I find it rather beautiful. Also, I would like to add that this is one of the first tournament games I played after a few months of a chess-break, and already in the one before I had blundered in a winning position. So maybe it has something to do with not enough practise or routine? The time control were 90min+30sec/move. } e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 Be7 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2 c5 11. d4 Qc7 12. Nbd2 Bb7 {All standard moves so far. I wonder, however, whether White might have been able to exploit Black's unusual move order, eg. 5...d6 instead of the more common 5...Be7? } 13. d5 {By no means compulsory, but I personally like this move after Bb7 - it renders the bishop useless until it moves again. Also, The knight has, for now, no squares left. In the next few moves, however, it does not take long until Black has fully equalized - might there have been something better here?} h6 14. Nf1 Bc8 {(!) I probably wouldn't have found this move, but to me it appears to be Black's best resource. (Anyone who knows better, please tell.) Not only freeing the b7-square, but also making it more difficult for white to put a knight on f5, the idea of which I liked very much. } 15. Ng3 {Not sure about this one. White is going to start an attack on the kingside, so maybe an immediate 15.g4 with the idea of 16.Ng3, 17.Nf5, and if Bxf5 then gxf would have been stronger? Also I am not quite sure whether Ne3 might have been better, for I could have still played g4. What made me refrain from Ne3 was the Bc1, which to mee looked rather dull, but I know that Ne3 is quite common in Spanish games, and what made me not play g4 was simply that I did not think of it. Does anyone know which one of the mentioned moves would have been the strongest? } Nb7 {?! Trying to start the compulsory queenside-assault, but, considering what happens next, I believe 15...Nc4 would have been better (with the continuation 16.b3 Nb6).} 16. Nf5 {?! Again I am not sure. I was thinking for quite a long time here, wondering what White wanted to achieve, and it all amounted in either a g-pawn-push, which would have meant I needed to put my knight somewhere else, or a knight on f5. I could, however, not think of any possibility to achieve the latter; 16.Nh4? Nxe4!, and Nf3-h2-f1-e3 takes too long. I could not find anything better and yet to me this move seems somewhat dubious - the white pawn structure gets really messed up. So, are there any suggestions of what White's best options would have been? } Bxf5 17. exf5 Na5 {...and back again. That's why I thought 15...Nc4 might have been stronger. The knight wants to go to b6, after which it would be almost impossible for me to keep my d5-pawn. } 18. b3 Qb7 19. Be4 {I figured that the bishop was not really doing anything anyway, and the rook might be able to swing to g4 at some point. Also, all other moves lose the d5-pawn. } Nxe4 {Should Black take here? The bishop was protecting the pawn, true, but apart from that? On the other hand, after g4-g5, Black does not need to think about saving the knight, but then again, there is no knight defending the king any more. } 20. Rxe4 Qd7 {?! After g4, the f5-pawn is protected, anyway. However, it does make the g5-push somewhat more difficult, for if I allow the queen to take on f5, there is one more mighty defender. I think the intention of Qd7 was to enable the knight to go back to b7, after which Black can play ...a5. } 21. g4 c4 22. b4 Nb7 {After this move, I thought quite a while whether or not to play 23.a4, trying to stall Black on the Queenside. I have been told some times that one should not make pawn moves on the wrong side of the board, meaning the board where one is not attacking, but after 23...a5 24.axb5 axb4 25.Rxa8 Rxa8 26.Rxc4 (or 26.cxb4 ?) I thought that Black is lacking the pawns he needs to really scare me. However, I did not like the idea of 26...Ra1, where I would have to spend some time freeing myself from all the pins. I guess Ba3 would be worth a closer inspection, too. However, I thought that attacking myself would give me more chances - can this, in some way, be true, or did White need to defend at this point? } 23. Nh2 {! It took me a long time to find but I believe it is the best move for launching the kingside attack. } a5 24. Qf3 {The intention behind Nh2. Now if Black wants to prevent g4-g5 from happening, he needs to spend some moves on defense and I figured I could build up a comfortable position in the meantime. } axb4 {?! And still I am not sure whether Black ought to have played ...Qd8 (...f6 would, of course, have prevented g5, too, but it just seems ugly to me. Even though I cannot see an immediate way of taking advantage of that, for I would need to break through all the pawns first. Also, the bishop would be really restricted. Or would ...f6 in fact have been working in order to stop the white attack?) } 25. Bxh6 {I was contemplating cxb4 for a long time, mainly because it prevents Nc5 and any such-like in-between-moves, but thought that, having played cxb, Black could use the time and play, say, Rac8, after which Bxh6 is much riskier.  The reasons to sacrifice a piece was that a) I figured I had to attack as soon as possible, otherwise the black pawns could be menacing; b) as far as I could tell, the sacrifice is sound. I was, at the time being, aware that I might not be able to calculate all the variations without mistake, but if there is a flaw in the sacrifice, I might just as well let my opponent show it to me.  If there is any variation in which White is badly punished for sacrificing the bishop, I'm eager to read about it. } bxc3 {?! 25...gxh6 loses, as far as I can tell, quite similarly to the game played. } 26. g5 {(!)  If the bishop retreats, then White has lost precious time while Black is a pawn up. So I am threatening f5-f6 and thinking of a possible Qh5. } gxh6 {If Black still refuses to take the bishop, then 27.Bxg7 (with the option of Qh5) Kxg7 f6+ seems to be winning. } 27. f6 {! Obvious and strong. } hxg5 {I do not think Bxf6 would have been stronger, for Rg4 and Qh5 are overwhelming. } 28. Rg4 {There is no way to hang on to the g5-pawn. Black is, as far as I can tell, totally lost by now. } Rfc8 {The best square for the rook. d8 is not far enough, and (much) later on the support of the c-pawn proved deadly. Even so, with best white play, this move doesn't help. } 29. Rxg5+ Kf8 30. Ng4 {? Even though I really liked playing this move, for this fetches one more attacking piece, afterwards I found the variation 30.Rh5! Ke8 31.Rh8+ Bf8 32.Qh5! Qd8 (say) 33. Rxf8+ Kxf8 34.Qh8#. Chess can be so easy...} c2 {?! 30...Ke8 was probably stronger, even though it shouldn't really have made any difference. } 31. Nh6 {And now, I thought, there is no way to prevent Rg8#.  } Ke8 {Oops. One more of those oversights which really shouldn't happen, but White is still winning. I have made the experience that often at least as much attacking resources turn up in a sacrificial variation as defensive. Even if one is not able to calculate the whole variation from beginning to end. } 32. fxe7 {I didn't want the bishop to be able to interpose on f8, so I took it away. I could still have played 32.Rg8+ Bf8 33.Rxf8+ Kxf8 34.Qg3 and mate soon follows. That's exactly what I meant before. I was not even close to finding this when sacrificing the bishop, and yet it would have worked...} Qxe7 33. Rg7 {White is still winning, by the way. Now what I thought of was 33...Nd8 (if 33...Qf8 then 34.Rg8, even though Qxg8+ Nxg8 Rxa2! might put up somewhat of a fight, but White should be winning) 34. Qf5; the Black king is trapped, Black is doomed. It all works together, the white attack is just overwhelming.} Nd8 {As expected. Now, however, when calculating how to end this as quickly as possible, I had the most interesting illusion of the black king and queen having changed places. I calculated, bearing in mind the position with a black Ke7 and Qe8. I was still aware of Qf5, which I had originally wanted to play, I just wondered, why, because I saw an easier solution. There was no time trouble at all, I double-checked the variation twice, to make sure there are no mistakes, and played the disastrous...} 34. Rg8+ {??, expecting 34...Qd7 35.Nf5+ Kf6 36.Nh4+ Ke7 37.Ng6+ fxg6 38.Qf8#. As soon as I had made the move (in fact, while lifting the hand from the piece), I saw with shock that it was not the queen I had attacked but the king... Had I played 34.Qf5, then Qb7 35.Rh8 with the decisive threat of Ng8+ could have been prevented only at high material costs. After the game I was asked how this happened and, really, I have no idea. I was really absolutely certain that the Black king was on the queen's square and vice versa, I don't know how I got to this illusion. Has anyone else got experience with not just overseeing something but seeing it wrongly? Is there a reason for such mistakes?} Kd7 {Now the game is virtually over. The black king escapes over the queenside, All White can do is try and delay the inevitable. } 35. Qf5+ Kc7 36. Rg7 Rxa2 {...and taking on f7 doesn't hurt Black in the least. After 37.Rc1, the rest of the game were about 20 moves of desperation by White and torture by Black, so I am not including it in this annotation, White being hopeless is quite obvious at this stage. Anyway, thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it.  }
