1. e4 {Well, basic as ever, a simple e4.  } d5 {!? This is a pretty weird move I played, yeah, but if played well enough, you can win with this. This commences the Scandinavian (or center counter) Defence!  } 2. exd5 {There was no other OK move here except for Nc3 and e5, and that's not even that good.  } Qxd5 3. c4 {Of course, the queen takes back, but I found 3.c4 a quite controversial move. It does bring another way out for the queen, but it doesn't exactly provide much control on the center. Also, if I keep my grip on the pawn and the Bishop moves away, I get a free pawn! 3. Nc3 would probably have been better. } Qe4+ {Other than Qe2, my opponent loses a pawn, (or rook, depending on how this is played.) If he blocks with 4. Be2, than I can simple use 4... Qxg2, forcing the bishop to come to f3. If he blocks 4. Ne2, than his c-pawn loses protection, and he loses a pawn. There are also setbacks with a less orginized position, and it ends in my move after 4... Qxe2 and 5. Bxe2 or Nxe2.  } 4. Be2 Qxg2 {As described before, the only proper move here.  } 5. Bf3 {With this, he blocks me from taking his rook, and technically forcing my Queen back to g6. (with g5, he can use d4, putting my Queen on a further run and developing his pieces faster.  } Qg6 6. Nc3 {Alright, he brings his knight out. He could do Be4 now, threatening my queen. } Nf6 {...But I don't let him. Let's see what he has to offer. } 7. d4 Bg4 {Now I'm trying to trade off my bad bishop for his good bishop!} 8. Bxg4 Nxg4 {... He is still one pawn down.} 9. Qa4+ {I don't know why, but I don't like this move. I think 9. Nd5 or Nb5 would have been better, as it threatens a Rook King fork.} Nc6 {Knight Block! Though this may seem worse than 9... Nd7 or even 9... c6, this is arguable better, because it actually allows Queen-side Castling without any consequences (O-O-O, Qxa7)} 10. Nf3 {I guess that this is for development. What else? Oh yeah, it protects the D-pawn.} O-O-O {I castle, as planned. Now, there are two attackers attacking the d-pawn. I just need to bring my a-pawn to safety, now.} 11. d5 Qd3 {Knight and a pawn for a rook and a knight (or checkmate)! Fair trade, right?} 12. Ng5 {I guess he didn't think it was that good for him. } e6 {Let's see what he does. Hopefully he will take the knight. If not, then he still will lose some. (Yes, I notice the rook fork, just don't care)} 13. Nxf7 {Gasp! Rook Fork! Don't care! Not like I need that h rook anyways.} Rd7 14. Nxh8 {Too greedy. Technically costed him the game.} exd5 {Finally, I take it.} 15. cxd5 Bb4 {Lets prepare for their checkmate.} 16. a3 {I really just don't care!} Re7+ {He is screwed. Only move left is Be3.} 17. Be3 Nxe3 {I think checkmate is inevitable now. Best combo he has is 18. fxe3 Rxe3+ 19. Kf2 Qd2+ 20. Kg1 (20.Kf1 Rf3 21. Kg1 Qf2#) Bc5, making it impossible(?) to stop the checkmating move 21... Re1#} 18. axb4 {He wants my bishop? Sure. Nothing to prevent it now! Well, it is the easier way out.} Ng2# {The checkmate is then delivered. There were ways out of that checkmate earlier, but it involved Several Sacs and a bad game for white. It was probably his greediness with the rook that led to his downfall. If there was a faster checkmate, please tell me!}
