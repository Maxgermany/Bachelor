1. e4 {Despite a late blunder from my opponent, the game was extremely interesting as a fight of a rook vs. bishop and pawns final... I think I could have won in an earlier stage, but I didn't find the way. } d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 6. d4 Bf5 7. O-O e6 8. Re1 Nf6 9. Ne5 Nbd7 {All these are standard moves in my experience. White seems to have an edge, but if black plays carefully, it all cames to nothing. } 10. Bf4 Bd6 11. Bf3 Nb6 {The first "new" move.} 12. Bg3 O-O-O {The key of black's game: to castle queenside in order to threath a future attack on the white king. } 13. Qe2 h5 {Starting a futile but annoying attack.} 14. h3 g5 {Tense situation... white's pressure is hot, but black is solid. } 15. Be4 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 Bxe4 17. Qxe4 f5 {The purpose to the exchanges. To weaken e3 is normally a mistake. But I thought I had to create attack, and my pawns are there for something. } 18. Qe2 f4 19. Bh2 c5 {BxK blocks the center, or proposes a pawn exchange (e3 - d5), that didn't convinced me much... c4 is a thematic move, here. It weakens black's king fortress, but opens the black diagonal to the queen or bishop in the future.} 20. c3 {The right defence, of course... } Rh6 21. Rad1 Rf8 {All to block the white's knight.} 22. f3 {So why to take it now? } Bxe5 23. Qxe5 Rf5 {The BxK exchange seemed to be a mistake, but I foresaw this position, and I thought that the black position becomed more prominent this way. In fact, my dsb had few places to go, and his knight was annoying. } 24. Qxc7+ Kxc7 25. b3 {With the black bishop in this corner, black has a slight edge here, in my opinion. Of course, I was looking for the way to push g4 safely, but I didn't find it. But my knight has a lot of possibilities, here...} Nd5 26. Kf2 {I cannot take the pawn safely... Rc8 and white takes the pawn back, improving his position. } cxd4 27. cxd4 {22.	f2-f3	d6-e5 23.	e2-e5	f8-f5 24.	e5-c7+	c8-c7 25.	b2-b3	b6-d5 26.	g1-f2	c5-d4 27.	c3-d4	d5-b4 28.	e1-e2	b4-d5 29.	e2-c2+	c7-d7 30.	d1-c1	   27.	c3-d4	c7-d7 28.	e1-e5	f5-e5 29.	d4-e5	d7-e7 30.	d1-c1	h6-h8 31.	g2-g3	h8-d8 32.	g3-f4	d5-f4 33.	c1-c7+	e7-e8 34.	h2-f4	g5-f4 35.	c7-b7	d8-d2+ 36.	f2-e1	d2-a2 37.	b3-b4	a2-h2 38.	b7-a7	h2-h3 39.	b4-b5	h3-f3 40.	b5-b6	f3-b3 41.	b6-b7	f4-f3} Kd6 28. g4 hxg4 29. fxg4 Rf7 30. Kg2 {I would say first mistake. Ok, I cannot play Ne6+... does he believes I would fall in this trap? White should have tried to occupy the c column. Or maybe he wanted me to fall in the trap and advance the pawn, in order to free his bishop and, eventually, take my pawn. It was what happened...} Kd7 {In order to play f6+, or Ne6+} 31. Bg1 f3+ 32. Kg3 Nc3 {Probably, the best plan here was Nf4. This plan almost forces the win of a quality, but... does it win?} 33. Rd2 Ne2+ {My trap. If Kf7, Rxh3, and if Kh2, f7. Black has to take the pawn to prevent queen... } 34. Rdxe2 fxe2 35. Rxe2 Rhf6 {Played without thinking. Black's advantage is almost useless, here, due to the weak pawns. A good lesson. Rf-h7 was the right move, in order to keep white anchored to the defence of h3.} 36. Re5 Rg6 37. Be3 Rfg7 38. a4 Kd6 39. Bd2 b6 40. Bb4+ Kc6 41. Bd2 Rd7 {The only way to progress I saw. It is dangerous, but gives me a free pawn. But TWO to white...} 42. Bxg5 Rxd4 43. Kh4 Kd6 44. Re3 e5 45. Kh5 Re6 46. h4 Rd5 {Trying to exploit the self-made white king trap.} 47. Bh6 {A pawn's square, in this position, is essential!} e4+ 48. g5 Rd3 49. g6 Re5+ 50. Kg4 Ke6 {With my king nearer the white pawns, I think all is beareable.} 51. Bf4 Rxe3 {A blunder! If black plays Bxe5, I cannot take the bishop or the pawn goes to g8... and I cannot prevent it easily. I must go to g1 with my rook, and let's see if I can stop the pawns! } 52. Bxe3 Rd5 {Trying to create room for my rook. The idea is to "use" the d pawn in order to take the white's b one. A very weak plan, compared to my strong attack in the previous moves. } 53. h5 Kf6 54. Bc1 {Too late. With my king on h6, I'm safe.} Kg7 55. Bb2+ Kh6 56. Bf6 e3 57. g7 Kh7 58. Kf3 Rd3 59. b4 Ra3 60. a5 bxa5 61. bxa5 Rxa5 {Can I win this final? Probably not. But white doesn't see a tactical...} 62. h6 Rf5+ {Over. But probably a drawn. }
