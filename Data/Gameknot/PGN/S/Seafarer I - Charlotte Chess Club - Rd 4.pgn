1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 4. Nd5 Nf6 5. Bc4 {Here White deviates from the Three Knight's Game (C46).  He is hoping for the knight exachnage so he can place his WSB on d5 however this does hang the e4 pawn.} Be6 {Black builds his attack on the knight.  His better move might have been to capture the e4 pawn.  } 6. d3 {The d4 move provides security to the e4 pawn and opens the option of moving the d5 knight. } Nd4 7. c3 b5 {The number of threats in the center of the board is building to a breaking point.  Seeing this black applies presure to White's WSB to help reduce these threats.} 8. cxd4 {White determines that it is time to being trading down the pieces in the center. } bxc4 9. dxe5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Bxd5 11. dxc4 {This is a great move for white.  It creates a double attack on black's WSB and lays the trap for the c pawn.  If black takes then Qc4 will capture the bishop.  If white would have taken d6 then he would find himself in a weaker position.} Bxf3 12. Qxf3 {At this point White has the one pawn lead but more importantly he has the two three pawn sets and still has the ability to castle to a secure position.  Black on the other hand has a restricted pawn structure and after a few moves he will lose his castling ability.} Rb8 {This move is questionable.  It does pin the bishop to c1 for the time being however black might have been better served by Qd7 (to prevent white's next check move).} 13. Qc6+ {Black has two options.  Move the king and lose any opportunity at castling or block with the queen.} Qd7 14. Qxd7+ {The queen trade works in favor of white who has both the pawn advantage and still maintains the ability to castle which puts his king a strong position and moves his h rook into the game.} Kxd7 15. exd6 {White offers up the pawn trade to further weaken black by create to singular pawns on the queen side.} Bxd6 16. O-O Rhe8 17. Rd1 {White's main goal now is to trade down all the major pieces while maintain his solid pawn lead.  The rook move pins the bishop so black can either leave it there or move the king to free up his vital piece.  } Ke7 18. Re1+ {To continue with White's plan of trading down material, the check forces white to move the king and allows for the rook trade.  } Kf8 19. Rxe8+ Kxe8 20. b3 Be5 21. Rb1 c5 22. Bb2 {This move accomplishes two goals for white.  It attacks the BSB which can no longer be saved by black (because white is still trying to trade down material) and it allows the rook full access to the rank.} Bd4 23. Bxd4 cxd4 {Given the thread of this pawn and the possibly of black supporting it with Rd8 white attempts to move his rook behind it.  The next check move allows white the tempo to place his rook on e5.} 24. Re1+ Kf8 25. Re5 Rd8 {Blacks rook move to d8 is now weak.  White, still with the plan of trading off all major pieces simple moves to d5.  If black decides to allow the trade the white king and cover the past pawn.  If Black decides to push the pawn then Rxd8  wins both the rook and the pawn.  If black moves the rook of D then he will just give up on the pawn.   All acceptable options to white.} 26. Rd5 Rxd5 27. cxd5 Ke7 28. Kf1 Kd6 29. Ke2 Kxd5 30. Kd3 {At this point, white has a strong end game option.   White's first goal is to place a pawn on both b4 and f4.  Once all of the pawns have been fully advanced these two pawns will then force the black king to retreat and allow white to both capture the d pawn and have opposition.  The opposition can then be leveraged to a point where white will be able to capture the black pawns and keep the black king a safe distance from his pawns.} a5 31. a3 g6 32. f4 f5 33. g3 h6 34. b4 a4 35. h3 g5 36. h4 gxh4 37. gxh4 h5 {White had hopped to reach this point on blacks move (having pushed f4 on move 32 put off his move count).  However, by sacking the b pawn he can still obtain the necessary opposition and move to capture the f pawn.} 38. b5 Kc5 39. b6 Kxb6 40. Kxd4 {At this point, black has all but lost asuming that white counts his moves correcly.} Kb5 41. Kd5 {This is the key move to the end game.  If white would have moved Ke5, he would have allowed white to draw the game.  However the Kd5 request the Black's Kd6 which provides white the extra move required to secure the queen promotion and the win.} Kb6 42. Ke5 {I} Kc5 43. Kxf5 Kc4 44. Kg5 Kb3 45. f5 Kxa3 46. f6 Kb3 47. f7 {Black Resigns.}
