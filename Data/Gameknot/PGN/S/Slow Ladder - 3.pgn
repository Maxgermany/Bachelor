[Opening "KGA (C37), Quaade gambit"]

1. e4 {I've been slowly creeping up the slow ladder and have now reached the point where I am seen as "easy meat" for some of the higher ranked players. Usually I oblige by making a daft move. Sometimes however my opponent gets stiffer opposition than they expect. This is one of those rare games and I was very pleased with the outcome.} e5 2. f4 {I start with the Kings gambit as this is something I have played quite a bit recently with some success. My theory is that its not seen so often and so it takes some players out of their comfort zone} exf4 {The gambit is accepted} 3. Nf3 g5 {This is the Quaade gambit which favours black in the gameknot database} 4. Nc3 d6 5. g3 g4 6. Nh4 f3 {The gameknot database still favours black quite strongly } 7. d4 {claiming the centre and opening a line for my dsb} Nc6 8. Bb5 {This move takes us out of the gameknot database} Bd7 9. Bf4 {Developing my lsb with a view to castling long, with hindsight this might have been a little premature} Be7 10. Nf5 h5 11. Qd2 {I was initially looking at Nxb however I then realised that I had something that was much more disruptive for black - Ng7+} a6 12. Ba4 Nf6 13. Ng7+ Kf8 {forced} 14. Bh6 {Now black looks to be in a bit of bother, the main threat being Ne6 winning the queen} Kg8 15. Ne6 {The knight is immune as taking it loses to Qg5+, Kh7, Qg7#. The black queen doesn't have many useful places to go due to the combination above, the exception is Qf8 which exchanges the queen for a knight (or bishop). The move I was expecting was Nh7 which holds off mate but loses the queen} Rxh6 {This is a decent try from black as the temptation of Qxh6 lets the black queen off the hook} 16. Nxd8 Rg6 17. Nxc6 {I wasn't sure here whether to try to extract my knight or to simply go for an exchange. I decided on the latter as I can double black's pawns on c which not only hampers him but means his a8 rook can be tied down to defending his a pawn while his other rook is hemmed in.} bxc6 18. e5 {Forces blacks knight to the sidelines as otherwise dxe5,dxe5 and black loses more material.  At this point black resigned and I was very happy.  }
