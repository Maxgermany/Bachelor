[Opening "Queen's Indian (E12), 4.Nc3"]

1. d4 Nf6 {Team match, I'm playing black and begin with the Indian system.} 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 {3. Nf3 is designed to avoid the Nimzo-Indian, and 3. ... b6 starts the Queen's Indian Defense.} 4. Nc3 Bb4 {4. Nc3 is the Three Knights Variation, and 4. ... Bb4 transposes back to the Nimzo-Indian (Three Knights Variation). Round and round we go...} 5. Bg5 Bb7 {Pin and counter-pin, and fianchetto. The bishops are having all the fun, and the knights are so full of pins they look like voodoo dolls. Nimzo-Queen's Indian, anyone?} 6. e3 h6 7. Bh4 g5 {Breaking the pin, much to the king's knight's relief.} 8. Bg3 Ne4 {Forking the white bishop on g3 and the knight on c3. Of the two, the knight on c3 should be white's priority right now.} 9. Nd2 Nxc3 {Hmmm, 9. Nd2? gets a ? for leaving the poor b2 pawn to die in defense of the knight on c3.} 10. bxc3 Bxc3 11. Rb1 d6 {Preparing c5.} 12. h4 Qf6 {Defending the rook on h8. Without this, the pawn on h6 would be pinned after hxg5 and could not recapture.} 13. c5 Nd7 {Capturing on c5 with either pawn just ends up with black having doubled and isolated pawns on the c-file. As played, whichever way white captures, and now he must capture, black can recapture with the backward c-pawn and avoid doubling or isolating any pawns.} 14. cxd6 c5 {The pawn on d6 isn't going anywhere, and white's center pawns need to go away.} 15. Qa4 cxd4 16. Bb5 Rd8 {Necessary. Does white see the hole in his own back yard?} 17. exd4 Bxg2 {Nope. Now white's pawn structure is thorougly busted. He has 5 pawns, and all of them are isolated, two of them are doubled.} 18. Rh2 Bd5 19. Rc1 Qxd4 {Black is ahead by a pawn, two after this capture, why not trade queens and begin the material liquidation toward an easy endgame?} 20. Qxd4 Bxd4 21. Rc7 a6 {I'm not sure now why I played 21. ... a6?!. It's not quite a blunder, since that pawn will die, or with 21. ... a5 white would follow with 22. Nc4 threateing to win the backward pawn on b6, and after 22. ... Bxc4 23. Bxc4, white can then freely attack the b6 pawn with his rook from b7. One pawn seems guaranteed to fall, but 21. ... a6?! seems like wasting time when there's better things to do. I think I planned to play 22. ... Ne5 after white unpins the knight, but that would have been a blunder, blocking the bishop on d4 from its defense of the rook on h8.} 22. Bxa6 f5 {I realized in time that 22. ... Ne5? would lose the pawn on g5, so I look for ways to harrass the white pieces. White cannot allow his bishop to be trapped by 23. ... f4.} 23. hxg5 hxg5 24. Rxh8+ Bxh8 {White may have his passed pawn on d6, but black has 3-for-1 pawns on the kingside. There must be a way to exploit that.} 25. f4 gxf4 26. Bxf4 Be5 {It seemed clever at the time. I didn't anticipate white's reply, though in hindsight, it seems obvious. I just figured he wouldn't let black take the d6 pawn so he would have to trade bishops.} 27. Bg5 Bxd6 {Well, gotta get the pawn, anyway.} 28. Ra7 Bb8 {28. Ra7 surprised me. Why not just 28. Rxd8 and win the exchange? Material would be imbalanced, but pretty much even. Black ahead by two pawns for the exchange would be relying on trying to promote those two passed kingside pawns. But white tried something else, and black found a way to save his rook.} 29. Rxd7 Rxd7 {White gives up the exchange voluntarily, but he seems to have a plan.} 30. Bb5 Bxa2 {OK, he can win the exchange back, so I'll just liberate him of his last remaining pawn.} 31. Nf3 e5 {I think white's plan here was to try to get his knight to attack the pinned black rook. But it has no path to get there that isn't covered by black's bishops or pawns. The route via h5 to f6 will still take a full 5 moves to achieve, during which time black's DSB will find a way to e7 and shut white down.} 32. Bf6 Kf7 {32. Bf6!? was not quite a blunder, but I believe it backfired on white. I think his plan was to win the pawn at e4, or force it forward to e5 where white could then play Be5 with possibly dire consequences for the black rook. However, black's simple reply forces white's hand. He must now take the black rook or lose the chance entirely.} 33. Bxd7 Kxf6 {Black's king defends both pawns. Black is ahead by three pawns and has the bishop pair to guide them to promotion. White correctly resigns.}
