1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 e6 3. Nf3 d6 {Closed variation. It is not easy to attack. } 4. Nbd2 Be7 5. e4 {d4 uncontested is not bad, but gives nothing definite. } Nbd7 6. h3 {I opted for a slow London thematic building moves. } O-O 7. g4 h6 {Now, the game is where I want it to be. Still, it's not easy to break. } 8. h4 {Sac g4. I'm not sure it's a wise move, but I almost could bet my opponent wouldn't take it. If he did, I'd played with the g column and a possible sac on h6. } Nh7 9. Bd3 {I have nothing yet, but I have to give myself some pressure against h7. I don't have time to play c3 - Qc2, and this is my worst problem. } Ndf6 {Reinforcing his position. } 10. g5 {...the only downside of black's move is this, so I take advantage, even sacrifying pawns. } Nh5 11. Be3 {No reason to lose the good dsb. Now, after my Nf3 moves, Nh5 is "en prise". For the tactics to come. } hxg5 {Not wise. Never open the game when defending, unless sure to mayor and safe exchanges. Now I got an open column. } 12. hxg5 g6 13. Rxh5 {...of course. I know I have to spend two tempoes to bring in the other R, but if I do, I'm done!} gxh5 14. e5 {Opening a way for my minor pieces. Qe2 was too passive. } dxe5 15. Nxe5 {...I'm ok with anyhing for g5... I'm threatening Qxh5!} f5 {Now, gxf6ep was maybe a little to offer him a lot of possible moves. } 16. Qxh5 {...this looks more straight to the point, looking to g6.} Bxg5 17. Qg6+ Kh8 {Of course not Nf7+, winning only the exchange and nothing more. Not with an open H column!} 18. O-O-O Qf6 {Nice try, but I can just stay!} 19. Rh1 {Forcing QxQ and the loss of the exchange and a minor piece!} Qxg6 20. Nxg6+ Kg7 21. Nxf8 {Black has an option that leaves my R on h8+... not nice. } Nxf8 22. Bxg5 Ng6 {Leaving me with the B pair is a nice edge, but on a blitz I was not able to correctly exploit it, and I almost lost the game. } 23. Nf3 Bd7 24. Bh6+ {? What for?} Kf7 25. Ng5+ {What for? Just to risk to be pinned after Rh8?} Kf6 26. Nh7+ Kf7 27. Bg5 {Ok, now the idea is that black can't play Rh8 or Bf6. Very nice, but again: what for? :-)} Bc6 28. Rh6 {? Mistake. Now, } Kg7 {...threatens the R so Bf6+ is not an option anymore.  } 29. Rh5 Bf3 {Harassing my R. Will it give black something?} 30. Rh3 Bg4 31. Rh2 e5 {? Great mistake, that improves drastically my position. } 32. Bf6+ Kf7 33. dxe5 Ke6 {It looks strongly like a mate net, but I can't see it clearly. Ng5+ was a promising start. I opted for} 34. Bc4+ Kd7 {e6+ looks very tempting. I can even sac f2 in order to play Rd2+} 35. Ng5 a6 {? Much more important was to cover...} 36. Rh7+ Kc6 37. e6 {Freeing the dsb. } b5 38. Bf1 {...threatening Bg2+. } Rf8 39. Bd4 {...covering an escape route for the BK. } Kd5 {Threatening it, but it's just to fall in the wolf's mouth (:-)} 40. c3 c5 {Too late...} 41. Bg2+ Kc4 {?? I have a mate net now, but I have to be careful: if Kc2, b4 can delay the mate. } 42. b3+ Kd3 43. Bf1+ {It seems coverable, but...} Be2 44. Rh3# {Live and nice! :-) It compensates so many bad games...}
