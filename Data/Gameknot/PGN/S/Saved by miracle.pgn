1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nf6 3. Nf3 g6 4. Nbd2 Bg7 5. c3 {For who is not used with my games, the London system is my favourite. I must admit that the black's fianchetto is always harder to manage than the normal line.} O-O 6. h3 {I have to be prepared to contest Bf5 whithout committing any other piece. In the London I don't care about castling... short. } Nbd7 {Passive play, good.} 7. Qc2 {Now I can pretend e4.} a5 {Almost useless move, premature attack. } 8. e4 dxe4 9. Nxe4 b6 {Opening the better line for the lsb. Now I have to be careful. I can play Bg2 myself and Rg1, but I wanted "more" from the position and I bet I could handle the pressure. I was wrong. } 10. g4 Bb7 11. Bd3 Nd5 12. Bg3 Nd7f6 13. Nfd2 {...f3 in emergency. NxN+ is another way out. No problem. } e6 14. O-O-O Rc8 {This I missed: f5. } 15. Nb3 {?? Horrible mistake that costs me the game. } a4 16. Nbd2 {Two lost tempoes are like surrender. } Qd7 17. a3 c5 18. c4 {?? Another horrible mistake. } cxd4 19. Ng5 {In desperation. } Ne3 {My opponent should have prepared this with Rd8 first.} 20. fxe3 dxe3 21. Nde4 {...and now black is a little worried! I'm not worried for my R, as long as the BQ is on the R's column. } b5 {Critic moment: I can't afford the opening of the column, I only have two tempoes before he opens it. My R wll become vulnerable... a disaster. But from here, I had the tactic strike NxNf6+, BxN, Bxg6 (discovering the threat on the WQ) and if the Q is saved, black is under mate attack, } 22. Nc3 {...I missed it. } bxc4 {...but not now! It also works, I think: } 23. Bxg6 Qe7 24. Bxh7+ Kh8 25. Be5 {I can't see what can black do to prevent BxN, followed by Bg8 and mate! Can you?} Bxh1 26. Bxf6 Bxf6 27. Bg8 Be4 28. Qxe4 {}
