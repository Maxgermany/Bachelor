1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Here is the third game in a series of 3 called Snap Mate.  Here my opponent, who has a rating of nearly 1600 falls into a snap mate after only 16 moves played.} e5 2. Nc3 {2. Nc3 - I try another Vienna.  I dabbled in one with Coach Ion and lost that game.  Instead of f4 I try Nf3.} Nf6 3. Nf3 d6 {3. ........ d6 - this is almost transposing into a Philidor.} 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 c5 6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Nbxd7 8. Nf5 {8. Nf5 - after an exchange of bishops on d7 I move my knight to an aggressive square putting pressure on the backward d pawn.} Ne5 {8. ......... Ne5 - and black centralises her knight.} 9. Bg5 g6 {9. .......... g6 - tries to drive the f5 knight away but .......} 10. Nd5 {10. Nd5 - piling up on the pinned f6 knight and threatening a nasty bishop fork on f6 should the f5 knight be taken.  Black tries to wriggle out with a queen check on a5.} Qa5+ 11. b4 cxb4 12. Bxf6 b3+ 13. c3 b2 14. Rb1 Rg8 {14. ........... Rg8 - up to here I have been following the database.  However, I look at the square f6 and my gut instinct tells me to analyse the board.  I therefore decide to exchange bishop for knight at e5.  This protects the c3 pawn for just one move.  I could have rounded up the pawn immediately but I think this is an improvement.  When playing through the analysis I noticed something else - the bishop taking on e5 also frees up the f6 square for my knight and bang we get a knight fork winning the g8 rook.  That is what will happen if black takes the f5 knight.  However, I also noticed that when I played out dxe5, Nf6 - the checkmate detector came on!  Wow, I thought.  I then set up conditional moves for both possible captures.  You can guess what black chose here, can't you?} 15. Bxe5 {The database game went like this in the game between phildo (1660) vs. ioaniuga (1712) in a gameknot team match:-  1. e4 e5  2. Nf3 d6  3. d4 exd4  4. Nxd4 Nf6  5. Nc3 c5  6. Bb5  Bd7  7. Bxd7  Nbxd7  8. Nf5 Ne5  9. Bg5 g6  10. Nd5 Qa5   11. b4 cxb4  12. Bxf6 b3   13. c3 b2  14. Rb1 Rg8  15. Rxb2 gxf5  16. Rxb7 Rc8  17. Bxe5 Rg6  18. exf5 Rh6 (black resigns)  Is 15. Bxe5 really stronger than the above, you the jury decide. } dxe5 16. Nf6# {16. Nf6# - yup, it is mate!  The pawn move onto the e file has opened up the d file for Glenda to control with fatal consequences for black!  A knight checkmate - cool!}
