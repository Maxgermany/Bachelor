1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 {This Bishop-stab is the diagnostic move of the Richter-Rauzer variation, although the "true R-R" requires a Black Knight at c6. That niggling detail does not, however, mean this tweak on the "official variation" is any less dangerous.} e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O {One of the two main book lines, the other being 9. Qg3 placing the Lady aggressively before castling long.} Nbd7 {A flexible move both dissuading White from pushing to e5 and setting the stage for any of about three different strategies, depending on White's next.} 10. g4 h6 11. Bxf6 gxf6 {!? -- This is one of the most arduous defensive variations playable in chess. -- So of course I play it as often as I can. ;-) -- Black commits himself to either castling on the Q-side (always dicey in the Sicilian) or leaving his King behind the center pawn barricade in exchange for gaining a lot of piece activity on both wings. As cramped as Black's position looks at this moment, White must regroup to conjure an attack of his own. Another choice on this move was ...Bf6 which gives White a somewhat easier midgame.} 12. Kb1 b5 {Still all book.} 13. g5 {?! -- This move hands Black a strategic goal he plays for in this variation, a powerful Knight posted on e5.} fxg5 14. fxg5 Ne5 15. Qh5 b4 {!? -- After the game xineohp told me he expected 15. ...Bg5. Mmm ... maybe. But the move had my spider-sense tingling after 16. h4 Be7, after which it's White who owns the g-file. I wasn't concerned about White doubling up on his h-pawns with 16. gh6: Rook pawns are weak at best, and doubled Rook pawns almost doubly so.} 16. Nce2 Bb7 {?? -- Black threatens to win the e-pawn *and* castle *and* then double Rooks on the h-file. If White plays 17. Ng3 his own steed blocks the g-file. All great ... except for 17. Ne6!! after which Black can hang up the towel. The right move was 16. ...Bd7.} 17. Bh3 {?? -- Returning the favor. As per the previous note, 17. Ne6 is devastating.} O-O-O 18. Bxe6+ Kb8 {"Box." Not 18. ...fe6  19. Ne6 and Black really has no particularly useful square for his Queen.} 19. Qh4 {! -- Not 19. Bf7?? hg5! wins the White Queen for a Rook.} hxg5 20. Qg3 Bxe4 {Now trying to drop the White N on e6 is no longer practical because of the threat of check at c2. The double-blunder at the 16th and 17th moves has touched off some serious fireworks with both players have attacking chances. } 21. Rhf1 Bxc2+ {?! -- Okay, it's *not* an easy continuation to see, and this *was* a speed game, and both of us *were* getting short of time by now ... but these are not sufficient excuses. Black now misses the chance to put the game away with 21. ...fe6!!  22. Ne6 Qc2  23. Ka1 Nc4!  24. Rb1 Qe2  25. Rf2 Qe3!  26. Nd8 Bd8, and Black has 3 minor pieces for the Rook and on the next move will either win back his Exchange (remaining 2 pieces up) or will trade Queens. If White plays Qe3?? then ...Ne3 threatens a smothered mate *and* gives Black time to win back the Exchange.} 22. Nxc2 fxe6 {Black is 2 joined, passed pawns ahead now and has a winning endgame if he just throttles back and consolidates.} 23. Ncd4 Qb7 {? -- 23. ...Qd7 is perfectly playable, but the "plakh tau" - the Vulcan blood fever (lol!) - must have been upon me because I'm still looking for a knockout that's no longer there.} 24. Nxe6 Rdc8 25. Ne2d4 Qe4+ 26. Ka1 Rh5 {?! -- The text eyes doubling the Rooks on the h-file, which is not a bad idea; but 26. ...Rc4 is better because it keeps Black's play boiling around White's King.} 27. Qb3 a5 28. a3 Rxh2 29. axb4 Qb7 {I was desperately short of time through this part of the game, but I'm still at a loss to suggest better for Black.} 30. bxa5 Rc4 31. Qxb7+ Kxb7 32. b3 Rc3 33. Rdc1 Rhh3 34. Rxc3 Rxc3 35. Kb2 Re3 36. Ka3 g4 {? -- 36. ...Nc6! with a probable draw after 37. Nc6 Kc6  38. Nd4 Kb7 and now White has to worry about his Knight before he can advance the pawns.} 37. Ka4 Nc6 38. Nxc6 Kxc6 {The difference here being, significantly, that White's King is a step closer now.} 39. Nd4+ Kd7 {?? -- An insane time-pressure blunder. Absolutely necessary was 39. ...Kb7. After 40. Rf7 Ka6.} 40. Nf5 Re4+ 41. b4 d5 42. Nxe7 Rxe7 {?? -- The final time pressure blunder, and more than enough. After ...Ke7 Black should still draw, being able to shepherd his own pawns while slowing the advance of White's. The rest of the game passes without need for further comment.} 43. Rg1 Re4 44. a6 Kc7 45. Ka5 d4 46. b5 Kb8 47. Kb6 Re6+ 48. Kc5 d3 49. Rd1 g3 50. Rxd3 Rg6 51. b6 Rg5+ 52. Kc4 Kc8 53. b7+ Kc7 54. Rd7+ {!! - The coup de grace.} Kxd7 55. b8=Q g2 56. Qb7+ Kd8 57. a7 {Black resigns. Not a perfect game by any means, by either player, but made all the more exciting *because* of the errors. Kudos to White for hanging in there! Very nice win!}
