1. Nf3 {Here is a relatively short game where I found an intriguing sacrifice idea. It begins with an orthodox kind of opening sequence.} Nf6 2. c4 {Standard Reti stuff.} g6 3. d4 {Claiming more of the centre while it's available.} d5 {Challenging the centre.} 4. cxd5 {Nc3 is more "mainline", but I chose this because after 4...dxc4 white has to spend a tempo on regaining the weak pawn later on. } Qxd5 {More aggressive than Nxd5, but will need to retreat/sidestep immediately. } 5. Nc3 {Free development with a tempo attack. } Qd6 6. e4 {Creating more presence in the centre, and threatening a cheap fork on e5.} Qb4 {Black avoids the fork, and pins the knight, threatening white's e4 pawn. It also prevents white's dsb from developing. } 7. Qa4+ {Offering the exchange. Black's Queen has moved three times already, so is behind in development. If the exchange is accepted then white will lose the e4 pawn though. } Qxa4 {Accepted} 8. Nxa4 Nxe4 9. Bd3 {Another free tempo for white. The knight must move straight back to f6 - d6 would just be plain horrible. } Nf6 10. Bf4 {Completing development and aiming at the weak c pawn. } c6 11. O-O {Tucking the king away and connecting the rooks. White is far ahead in development, but does have three pieces hanging. } Bg7 {Claiming the long diagonal, and preparing to castle. } 12. Rfe1 {Now if black castles white will regain the pawn. } e6 13. Bd6 {Keeping the black King from castling. White's dsb isn't easily chased away from the d6 square. Black could look at Bf8, but would be exchanging exactly half of his active army, and would still lose the right to castle on the kingside. } Nbd7 14. Nc5 {Bringing the knight away from the rim. If black exchanges then white can de-isolate the d pawn, and create chances for a rook planted on d1.} b6 {White must either retreat straight back to a4, go to b3, or exchange on e4. Unless...} 15. Nxe6 {Curiosity was the deciding factor in this move. A piece for two pawns and a (hopefully) strong attack on a somewhat awkward position seemed sound. Rxe6 may have been an interesting option, but black has time to respond before white can gain enough advantage to justify being a rook down. } fxe6 {More or less forced} 16. Rxe6+ {The attack begins. Kf7 seems like a very dangerous path for black, but after1 6...Kf7 17. Ng5+ Kg8 18. Re8+ Nf8 19. Bc4+ Nd5 it might be ok. the only oth er option is... } Kd8 {This seems to give white the chance to even up material with 17. Ng5 Bb7 18. Nf7+ Kc8 19. Nxh8 Bxh8. } 17. Ng5 Nf8 {The losing move for black. } 18. Nf7+ Kd7 19. Re7# {That's all folks! Thanks for reading - all comments welcome. }
