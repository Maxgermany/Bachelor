[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C69), exchange variation, Alapin gambit"]

1. e4 {"What opening should I play?"  "Your strongest."  For whatever it's worth, I really like opening with 1. e4 as well.} e5 {It's all a matter of personal taste, but when I have to face 1. e4, I almost always come back with e5.  It says so much:  "You're coming after us?  You're gonna have to go through me!"  Why let white think you aren't going to challenge his presence right from the start?} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez.  "The Spanish."  Threatening Black's setup right away, as the threat is to take the knight and then the unprotected pawn.    Black has many ways of addressing that threat to the pawn, including d6 (protecting it), Nf6 (attacking its opposition), Nd4 (where black has to accept doubled pawns on the d-file), and a6 (ignoring it).} a6 {The move to ignore white's threat, I understand, is experiencing competition at the top levels, where the Berlin Defense (3... Nf6) may now be king.  But the Morphy Defense offers a lot of advantages.  If white plays 4. Ba4, black has a good plan to drive the bishop away, castle kingside, and play for lots of different queenside and central attacking options, including the exciting Marshall Gambit.  (White has great chances and options too, of course.)   And if white plays Bxc6, black will have to justify his choice to ignore white's threat.  While much of the opening choice is just style, there's something to be said for playing to your strengths and preferences.  In my case, that equates to a brazen, impetuous style, if not a bit careless.} 4. Bxc6 {dieselengine9 is impetuous, too.  The exchange variation loses white the bishop pair but gives black doubled pawns.  If white can restrict black's mobility, he'll be in good shape.} dxc6 {But black has chances, too.  4... dxc6 is the superior recapture here, opening up lines for black's queen and bishop.  If black had played 4... bxc6, white can either grab the pawn or steam ahead in development, while black's light square bishop still struggles to get out.  The half-open b-file isn't enough compensation to justify that choice.} 5. O-O {Castling is superior to 5. Nxe5, where Qd4! gives black the edge.} Bg4 {But now the threat of Nxe5 needs to be addressed; otherwise black could lose a pawn for nothing.  Other options here are f6, Qd6, and Bd6, but the pin is certainly the most aggressive response.} 6. h3 {Forcing the issue.  If I take, I lose the bishop pair, which was my main compensation for the doubled pawns.  If I run, he can play g4, giving him a space advantage.  The choice is difficult.} h5 {But I was recently inspired by the Southern Chess captain, who crushed an opponent with a well-timed h5 in an OTB tourney.  http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=33156  It's a risky move to offer a bishop so early, but the open h-file is worth a lot in this position.  For example, 7. hxg4 hxg4 8. Nxe5 (or some such move; otherwise white loses his knight) Qh4! and white's barely hanging on.} 7. d3 {Now, I'm quoting from the game here, where dieselengine9 made this move and said:  "at least I know what NOT to do at this point."  Referring to playing hxg4, of course, not wanting to go down that route.} Qf6 {Protecting the e-pawn and coming over to where the action is.  Also threatening equality by doubling white's pawns on the f-file, and weakening the position around the white king.  But this game is pretty tame at this point.} 8. hxg4 {?!  But not anymore!  White goes for the bishop grab after all.    Both Nbd2 and Be3 look like better options.} hxg4 {The only sensible move.} 9. Bg5 {An aggressive try.  White is trying to hold onto his extra piece, whereas playing for development with Nc3 might offer a better plan.  For example, 9. Nc3 gxf3 10. Qxf3 Qh4 11. Qh3 Qxh3 12. gxh3 Rxh3, and white is down a pawn, but not totally out.  At this point, we have to conclude that white's 8th was a mistake.} Qg6 {Again, the only reasonable move.  Now white will either have to give up his knight or his bishop, all while figuring out how to deal with the h-file.} 10. Nh2 {An interesting option: white gives up the bishop to try and defend with the knight.  White is likely planning 10. Nh2 Qxg5 11. Qxg4, weathering the storm.  In hindsight, perhaps Nbd2 would've offered more resistance; 10. Nbd2 gxf3 11. Nxf3, and even though black can force the win of the g-pawn, he has a hard time getting more.  } Qh5 {!  The best way to keep the pressure on!  Why settle for a mere bishop-for-pawn when you can get so much more?  The immediate threat is Qxh2#, or, if the knight moves, Qh1#.} 11. f3 {White had only a few moves to avoid mate, and this is much worse than both 11. f4 (which prevents g3 due to the Qd1) and 11. Re1 (which gives the king a route for escape).  Black has multiple good ways to continue, including 11... Bc5+, which gameknot's computer analysis prefers.} g3 {I prefer this continuation, which applies much more pressure.  How does white avoid mate in this position?  A knight move won't do (Qh1#), and there's no way to defend the h2 square from Qxh2#.} 12. Re1 {??  Right piece, wrong square.  Rf2 was the only shot at life, where white's best option is to basically sacrifice his entire army to get black's queen off the board.  But this move leads to a forced mate on the 15th move.  Can you find it?} Qxh2+ {First move's easy.} 13. Kf1 {Forced.} Qh1+ {Starting the king on his death march forward.} 14. Ke2 {Forced.} Qxg2+ {The rook, queen, and bishop all cannot come to the king's defense, and his own pawn blocks his escape towards the queenside.} 15. Ke3 {Forced.  Note that there will be no moving forward anymore, as black's first move (1... e5!) now cuts off the possible escape squares.} Qf2# {And that's it!  I know I'm rated 300 points higher and a game like this should be easy, but it's very hard, even at ~1800, to go 15 moves without making a single mistake.  (Although if you find one, comment and let us all know!)  I was lucky to be able to capitalize on this one, and smart enough to use the initiative to go after the king instead of grabbing material.  Hope you enjoyed it!}
