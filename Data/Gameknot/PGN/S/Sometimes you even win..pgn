1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nbd2 Bf5 5. c3 {This is a very necessary move (or a3). White can't allow the black N to jump to b5, or it will be almost game over. } e6 6. h3 {...e3 is more to the point, but I want to play my favourite...} a6 7. g4 Be4 {First time I face this move. In theory, black is not advised to exchange his strong lsb.} 8. Nxe4 Nxe4 {...and less than to expose his N over there. } 9. h4 {Cutting his way back, or a future incursion of the BQ on h4.} f6 {Interesting, I won't say it's good. } 10. e3 e5 11. dxe5 fxe5 12. Nxe5 Nxe5 13. Bxe5 {Black has some activity for the pawn, let's see...} Qe7 {I think this is the best move. If I take in d5, Rd8 seem very strong, as I am committed to the defence of the bishop. I can take the N, true, and then he can't move the Q from the column or I'll check him removing the dsb. } 14. Qxd5 Nf6 {Now the fun begins. } 15. Qxb7 {He has to move the R, and Rd8 is certainly a nice square for it. } Rd8 16. Bxc7 {I feared Qd7, but after Bg2, Qd2+, Kf1, I think I'll have the best of it. } Rd7 17. Qc8+ Kf7 18. Bc4+ Kg6 {Here, I think better was Bf4, threatening h5#. But he can hold playing h5 himself. Maybe. Anyway, black seems lost. Still, I am able to screw the game all the same...} 19. h5+ Kh6 20. Bf4+ g5 21. hxg6 e.p.+ Kxg6 {How to continue? Rh3+, NxR, QxR seems playable, but is kind of a waste of the attack. } 22. Qxa6 {...pinning the N and getting an overwhelming endgame as a minimum. } Qe4 23. Rh5 {Threatening Rg5+.} h6 24. Be6 {Allowing black to take the R.} Nxh5 25. Bf5+ {...but winning the Q in return. } Kg7 {Would you take the Q, dear reader? Of course not...} 26. Qg6# {This time I didn't fail to convert a win! Thanks for reading.}
