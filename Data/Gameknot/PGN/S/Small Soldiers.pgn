1. g3 {For this game, I decided on a hypermodern approach } e5 2. Bg2 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d3 d5 5. Bg5 Be7 {All solid opening play so far, though back at move 3, Nc6 isn't seen a lot - it seems that the other knight move, Nf3, was more popular with the Gameknot Database though I don't know why [also more popular was d5, which I had played next move]  } 6. Nf3 O-O 7. O-O {I bring out my other knight and both sides have now castled. Only two other games had reached this position in the GK database, and two different moves - h3 and Be6 - were played with a win for White and a draw respectively. Black plays neither of these moves and plays... } d4 {?! I can't help but feel that this was a little premature for Black. It shifts my knight, but the knight can easily escape. Furthermore, it gives my bishop on g2 more scope, increasing its influence on the long diagonal. Finally, the knight can simply retreat to b1 where it can easily re-route itself to the d2 square... } 8. Nb5 {?! And in hindsight, I really should have done that! I was unwilling to develop my knight, but I played this move too quickly! Black's next move is obvious... } a6 {...and I have to move my knight again, to the edge of the board! } 9. Na3 {Here, Black now has the option of Bxa3, weakening my kingside pawns, and if he had done that I would have counted on a semi-open b-file for compensation (I don't think it would have been enough compensation though) } Ne8 {!? Instead, Black surprised me with this move - looks like that knight is headed for d6! Not only that, my bishop is also threatened with capture... } 10. Bxe7 {... but that's taken care of easily! } Qxe7 11. Nc4 {Improving the position of my knight. } f6 {Played to support e5 and to allow the queen and c6 knight protecting that square to move. However, it does leave a light-squared gap in the defence of the Black king and White now seeks to exploit that as soon as possible... } 12. c3 {! ...with this move! Not only does this challenge the pawn chain that Black has built up, it also allows Qb3, which could allow a deadly discovered attack... though I'll admit, the discovered attack is wishful thinking } Be6 {! For one thing, Black has this, guarding the weak diagonal. Kh8 would also have worked, but it isn't a developing move like the one played. } 13. e3 {Of course, now Qb3 would not be smart at all now due to the move b5. The move I play here threatens to win a pawn, so Black must do something about that - Rd8 doesn't work because after the exchanges [14.PxP PxP 15.PxP NxP 16.NxN RxN and then White can capture the b7 pawn. That leaves capturing a pawn... } dxc3 {It's hard to choose, but I like the other pawn capture better (slightly) since the the rook could now go to b2 to pressure the b7 pawn, which is also being indirectly attacked by my g2 bishop. However, that's not the plan I embark on here } 14. bxc3 Rd8 {Because of the pin on the d-pawn and the position of my knight, Black threatens 15...e4. The pawn is also the only thing guarding my knight on c4, so moving the queen away won't help here. } 15. Nb2 {! The potency of 15...e4 is now lost with this move, ensuring that Black can't get any material gain out of it. It also adds extra protection to my d3 pawn... just in case! :) } Nd6 16. d4 {White gets agressive - by threatening the fork 17.d5, Black now has to move either his bishop or his knight... } Bg4 {Understandable, since the c6 knight doesn't immediately have a good square to jump to (actually, Nc6-b8-d7 might have been an idea) Also, this move delivers a threat of its own - 17...e4! winning a piece. However, the queen can easily sidestep with check now that the diagonal to the king has been opened! } 17. Qb3+ Be6 {? Definitely not the strongest option here, as now White gets the chance to play d5. Kg8, or blocking with another piece would have been better. } 18. d5 Bf7 {Unfortunately, due to the pin on the pawn I can't win material. However, I still get a nice gain of space with my pawns! } 19. c4 {Now that the pin on the knight is broken, the c6 knight is under threat once again! } Na5 {the knight doesn't look too comfy on the edge of the board like this, but it does make sense to get the tempo attack on the queen. Even so Nb8 [heading to d7] ought to have been played because White cannot support a pawn push; 20.Nb8 c5? 21.Nb5 e4 22.Nd7! and the c5 pawn falls. } 20. Qc3 {Sidesteps the threat and returns the attack. } b6 {Forced... so what is White's plan now? It's more obvious why 21.c5 can't be played here [21...Nb5! Now comes with tempo and White doesn't have time to save d5] so White needs to look at another plan. } 21. Ne1 {Eventually, I decide on the plan - occupy the c6 outpost! Including the one played now, that would take four moves, but the closed nature of this position makes it feasible enough. Of course, White would have loved to have used the other knight (which could reach c6 in three moves) but that knight has a job protecting the c4 pawn. } Nab7 {Black starts moving his own knight - there's an outpost on c5 where it may be useful... } 22. Ned3 Rdb8 {?! I can assume that Black didn't play Nc5 now because of the fear of Nxc5, but he also doesn't seem to realise what White's plan is. If he had, then 22...a5! Would have prevented the knight manoeuvre to c6.  } 23. Nb4 {! The c5 outpost is now within reach, and what's more, the a6 pawn comes under fire as well. To prevent material loss, Black must move his rook again and play Ra8... } Qd7 {? Black probably didn't want to move his rook again, and decided on moving the queen instead... Black overlooks the hanging pawn } 24. Nxa6 Rba8 25. Nb4 Na5 {The knight returns to a5, preventing Nc6 for now. With that option eliminated, I look at the pawn pushing idea again - c5 can now be played, but first... } 26. a4 {White doesn't want the knight to retreat to a4 when c5 is played, and I had two scenarios planned for c5 - 1) Pawn takes pawn, queen takes pawn, and White can get some strong c-file presence. 2) Knight moves, c6 with White grabbing even more space queenside! However, Black changes my plans completely... } c5 {? Though it's not to his advantage! Thinking that driving my knight back is strong, Black completely forgets about the en passant capture rule } 27. dxc6 e.p. Qc7 {Now that the c pawn is passed, Black blocks it with his queen } 28. Nd5 {A tactical trick - although direct protection of the pawn has been removed, it is immune as 28...Qxc6 is met with Ne7+!, winning the queen. } Bxd5 {Perhaps not wishing to move his queen and allow a possible c7, Black exchanges. } 29. cxd5 Kh8 {I can't really see any good plans for Black here either - reader comments would be welcome on that! } 30. e4 {Supporting my powerful pawns. } Rab8 {Black looks towards a future b5, hoping to open up the b-file for counterplay. } 31. f4 {However, Black gets distracted by my own operations kingside. There's the rule that when down material, exchange pawns and not pieces but in the process, I gain a third passed pawn and the three pawns become a formidable force! } exf4 32. gxf4 Rbe8 33. e5 fxe5 34. fxe5 Nf7 35. d6 {Black has brought another rook over to halt the pawn advancement, but he misses the chance to stop the pawns right here with 35...Nxd6. Unfortunately, that seems to be a neccessity in this position... } Qa7 {Though this does have a discovered check with b5, it doesn't really do anything. } 36. d7 {Onward! } Rxe5 {Black snaps off one of my pawns, but now 37.c7 wins sufficient material to win the game. However, White has something much more decisive... } 37. Rxf7 {!! Black understandably resigns at this point. Not only is the rook immune due to back-rank mate, both rooks are now hanging. Also, with my two passed pawns, White is set to win even more material! 1-0 }
