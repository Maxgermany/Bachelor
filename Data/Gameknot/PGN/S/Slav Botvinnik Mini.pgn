1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 c6 5. Nf3 dxc4 6. e4 b5 {This varation of the slav is very sharp. I have to admit that I did not like this openning very much when I started this tournament. In my opinion this opening is complex and unforgiving. I would not recommend it to beginner players.   Things that I like about it:  - I like black's dynamic pawns.  - I like white's powerful attacking chances. } 7. e5 Nbd7 8. g3 Bb7 9. Bg2 h6 10. Bh4 g5 11. Nxg5 {White gets three pawns and a clear h pawn for the piece. This also removes black gaurd of the light squares in the centre. As well white has an enduring space advantage in the centre. } hxg5 12. Bxg5 Qb6 13. exf6 O-O-O 14. O-O b4 {White has several options here. A strong one is D4} 15. Rb1 {This is a great square for the rook.} bxc3 16. bxc3 {The B file is clear. black has to move quickly. } Qa5 {Black's most active choice} 17. Qc2 Nb6 18. Bf4 c5 {Kurejiyaro missed this move. D4 is preferred.} 19. Bxb7+ Kxb7 20. Qe4+ Rd5 {A nice square for the rook dont you think!} 21. dxc5 Qxc5 {The coast is clear and black is sitting pretty. White is totally passive. } 22. Be3 Qc6 23. Bxb6 axb6 {While white is slowly trading away his pieces black is gaining strength. } 24. a4 {big error. White had to play h4} Rxh2 25. Kxh2 {It is hard to see why this move is good } Rh5+ 26. Qh4 Rxh4+ 27. gxh4 Qf3 28. a5 Bd6+ {}
