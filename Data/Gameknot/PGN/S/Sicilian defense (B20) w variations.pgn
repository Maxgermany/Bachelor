[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 {This is a fast ladder match I played against wmaes, a great opponent.  There are some instructive segments to this chess match which I think bear further scrutiny, and are profitable to all, therefore without further ado...} c5 2. d3 {Not my favored response to the Sicilian, but definitely playable.  There are a number of good lines from this position which offer exciting play.} e6 {To give natural development for my bishop and allow for an eventual center push.} 3. c4 {I was expecting g3, or bringing out one of the knights.  This pawn structure is one that certainly seeks to control the center, but I don't like giving potential homes to knights by creating a vacuum on both sides.  If I can get a knight to d4 (and keep him there), he will be powerful.} Nc6 4. Nf3 Nf6 {All natural development for black so far.} 5. e5 {An unexpected incursion into black territory!  I was a little taken aback by this move as it was completely unexpected.  However, I felt that I only had one response.} Ng4 {Now there is double pressure against his e pawn.  I'm curious what white was thinking to accomplish with the early assault, however, to the point, now white has two choices for defense: Qe2 or d4.} 6. Qe2 {This seems like a more natural play, since it brings another piece into the game and doesn't abandon the c4 pawn to itself.  Also since white is probably looking to fianchetto his bishop on g2, this protective move will offer more playable options for white.  I think the queen move was the better of the two choices.} d6 {And now white has to take, since it is 3 against 2.} 7. exd6 Bxd6 {A fairly central axiom to chess is: where possible move pieces before queens/rooks.} 8. g3 {Preparing for the Bg2 move.} O-O 9. Bd2 {This move also surprised me.  Perhaps white saw the chance to go Bc3, giving him strong attack lines to the king?  However, I believe that white's priority should have been castling before thinking that far ahead.  Better to protect your king while you can.  Since my king is already castled, I can start probing white's defenses for weakness and go on attacks of my own.  wmaes is a very good player, so perhaps he has something up his sleeve?} Nge5 10. Nxe5 {I believe that this move was a mistake for the sequence that is about to unfold.  I expected Bg2, in preparation for a castle, but now things are about to get ugly.} Bxe5 {Threatening b2 and ultimately a1.} 11. Bc3 {I thought white might move up his knight, but there is a certain logic to bringing in the bishop.  However, as soon as this move was made I saw a possible way to get white to lose his castle.  My hand was forced to take on c3.} Bxc3+ 12. Nxc3 Nd4 {Now the power play, I am attacking white's queen, but also threatening Nc2+!  Also note, that white made this powerful position possible with the early pawn structure he chose.} 13. Qd1 {The only play...} Qf6 {Now for an attack of my own.  White has two real responses here, Bg2 or the path he chose, Ne4.  If Bg2, Qe5+ offers some rich possibilities for black.} 14. Ne4 {Attack!  Or is it?} Nf3+ {Now white has no choice but to move Ke2.} 15. Ke2 Nd4+ {Another check allowing my queen to get to safety and protect c5.} 16. Kd2 {This move makes sense from the standpoint of getting his king out of the way for his back row to link up.} Qe7 17. Ke1 {I'm not certain about the utility of this move.  Although white has lost his castle, he still has piece parity, so now I would have moved Bg2 (still!) to continue development, then all of his pieces on the back rank are supporting each other.} f5 {No good options for white's knight except to retreat.} 18. Nd2 {I was expecting Nc3, but perhaps white is looking down the road to an e/f pawn march and wants the knight handy to play defense.} b6 {supporting my c pawn and giving a place for my bishop to develop upon, namely b7.} 19. Bg2 {The long awaiting bishop move, but I have a nice counter punch.} Bb7 {Since my queen is on the same back rank, I can protect the bishop, and if white takes, he gives me a prime diagonal of power from which to attack.  I think f3 is a viable response and should be given serious consideration.} 20. Bxb7 Qxb7 21. Rg1 {Any other rook move would lose material, but what about f3?  It would allow the king to go to f2, and give some breathing room for the coming storm from my hungry pieces.} Rae8 {in preparation for the assault on white's king, who is conveniently boxed in to his spot by a queen and a knight.} 22. f3 {Perhaps a little too late.} e5 {And so it begins.} 23. Kf1 {I think Kf2 is better here, providing support for his g1 rook, and giving some extra defense for his f3 pawn.} e4 {Decision time for white.  There is a lot of power projecting into his king's turf and there are a couple of possible responses.  My expectation was dxe4 or f4.  I also wondered if white might try Nxe4.  dxe4 would be followed by fxe4+, and f4 would be followed by e3!, likely winning the knight, and opening a hole for a rook to wade in, supported by a knight.  When your king is being pressured, it is best to avoid open lines of attack.} 24. fxe4 {color me surprised!  This is the one move I didn't expect white to make.  However, the response is a given.} fxe4+ {Now no matter which way white goes, he is in for some pain.  White resigned here.    The main lessons from the game, I believe, are instructive: look to castle before going aggressive; and when your opponent has already castled and you have not, s/he will go on the offensive, so quickly develop pieces that will help you castle, so you can have a measure of safety.
