1. e4 {I love getting feedback from the community here and so I thought I'd share this game because I won it and only 1 exchange of pawns happened in it.} d5 {Rare I that I face d5 when I play e4} 2. e5 {So this affords to spare you guys another of my bishops opening games. I always like to reply with e5. As a nimso player as black I really hate the discomfort of this pawn and so I don't hold back to use it when I can as white hehe.} c5 {Opponent replies with c5. First time I face this.} 3. d4 {I still reply with d4.} e6 {Personally I think I would've done cxd4 to gain some time on queen retake with 4.Qxd4 Nc6. But he opted with e6.} 4. c3 {I always love c3 as white and this will keep middle solid.} cxd4 {Opts for the exchange now.} 5. cxd4 Ne7 {Hmm blocks in dsb looks like my opponent is either cramping himself or looking for a Qside battle} 6. Bd3 {I love this spot for lsb set to attack on his king side castle. Don't need to help him develop with a Bb5+} Nec6 {Hmm moves same knight again I guess my assumption of him wanting to fight qside was right.} 7. Be3 {Defend d pawn + development.} Bb4+ {My opponent likes the bishop check contrary to me.} 8. Nc3 {I often choose to block with knight in hopes of forcing a bishop for knight exchange in a near future} a6 {Passive move since my lsb is already developed and I plan on not budging my knight.} 9. a3 {Sorta passive reply on my part but in the hopes of getting the wanted exchange.} Ba5 {Does not bite.} 10. Nge2 {Further development heading to castle. Is nf3 a preference call? Or is ne2 preferable keeping a possibility on moving the f pawn if wanted in a near future?} Nd7 {Develops his other knight looking at my opponents position I find him really cramped and I'm almost ready to strike} 11. O-O O-O {Mutual castlings.} 12. Nf4 {Took a while to analyse some Bishop dives as I love sacrifices lol but opted for a tad slower attack including my knight.} Bb6 {Pressure on my d pawn.} 13. Bc2 {Felt this was the appropriate reply keeping lsb on that diagonal} Na5 {Hmm curious reply? As my lsb covers b3 I guess he's heading to the c4 outpost with that knight } 14. Qg4 {Let's get this show on the road!} Nb8 {??? I believe this is a blunder. I think he's trying to create some sort of blind attack on my queen with his lsb in the hopes of moving his f pawn to attack but its too late after this move I think it's forced mate!} 15. Nh5 {Forward charge!} g6 {Forced} 16. Nf6+ {The end is inevitable now I believe.} Kg7 {Did Kh8 offer a possibility of survival?} 17. Qg5 {Opponent resigns here nothing to stop me even if he gives up his queen. All comments appreciated as always.  A quick feel good win within 20 moves. With only 1 exchange in the entire game!}
