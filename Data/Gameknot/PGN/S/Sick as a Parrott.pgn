1. e4 {Hi everyone!  This is a very old match, at one stage I looked like losing it, then my opponent blundered somewhere and I got into a winning position and then I blew it big time and I ended up taking a Low Draw.  This match starts off as a Philidor with a double king pawn opening, me playing 2. Nf3 and black (Daniel) responding with d6.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 {3. d4 - the main and most favoured line of the World DB.} Nc6 4. dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 {5. ....... Kxd8 - queen trade.} 6. Bc4 f6 7. O-O Ke8 8. Nc3 {8. Nc3 - development.} Nge7 9. a3 Bg4 10. Nd2 {10. Nd2 - rather passive but I did not want the pawns in front of Henry to be shattered.} Nd4 {10. ...... Nd4 - an aggressive placement for the black steed though.} 11. Bd3 {11. Bd3 - necessary to defend the pawn on c1.} a6 12. f3 Bd7 13. Ne2 Nxe2+ 14. Bxe2 {14. Bxe2 - Fou Leblanc reads the last rites to that black steed.  I say Good Riddance!} Ng6 15. Nb3 {15. Nb3 - time now to clear the way for Fou Lenoir to develop and to connect those rooks.} Be6 16. Be3 {16. Be3 - I cannot avoid my pawns being busted on the other side though.} Bxb3 17. cxb3 {17. cxb3 - like this.} Bd6 18. b4 {18. b4 - trying to keep those little footmen together.} Ne7 19. Rfd1 Ng6 20. g3 {20. g3 - to keep out that other black steed.} Kf7 21. Rac1 Rhd8 22. Bc5 Bxc5+ 23. bxc5 {23. bxc5 - I do straighten out my pawns but at a price.} Ne7 24. Bc4+ Ke8 25. Bd5 Nxd5 26. exd5 {26. exd5 - I seem to have a decent queenside pawn structure.  However, Danny can undermine it......} c6 27. dxc6 bxc6 {27. ...... bxc6.  Pawn trade - was 27. dxc6 a mistake - and was d6 an improvement?  Can you the Inquest Jury decide?} 28. b4 Rxd1+ 29. Rxd1 {29. Rxd1 - rook trade.} Rd8 30. Rxd8+ Kxd8 {30. ...... Kxd8 - another rook trade and this is now a K & P ending.  I now bring Henry out to the centre as far as he can go lickety-split!} 31. Kf2 Ke7 32. Ke3 {32. Ke3 - I put in a draw offer, it is declined.  Although the game does end in a draw I suppose the coming comedy of errors livens it up a bit.} Ke6 33. Kd3 Kd5 {33. ....... Kd5 - black has the opposition - this looks a little ominous for white.} 34. g4 g6 35. h3 h5 36. h4 f5 {36. ....... f5 - black rolls down his pawns.  I now try and break up his kingside pawn structure.} 37. gxf5 gxf5 38. Kc3 e4 39. fxe4+ Kxe4 {39. ....... Kxe4 - I was expecting exf4 but this move looks just as good.} 40. Kd2 f4 41. Ke2 f3+ 42. Kf2 Kf4 43. a4 {43. a4 - the only move to avoid a zugzwang.} Ke4 44. b5 axb5 45. axb5 Kd5 46. bxc6 {46. bxc6 - this is just sooo awful!  It was about 5.45 am and I was yet to take a shower - I wish I bally well had done.  I felt as sick as a parrott.   If so I should have pushed my pawn up to b6.  There would have been no way Danny could stop my pawn from reaching Glendadom.  I analysed from here that I had nothing better than a draw so I offered it.  After three agonising days wait my opponent accepted.  After Danny accepted the draw offer I had a chat with him - he was really nice about it saying "these things happen".  Ah well, every cloud has a silver lining and that one silver lining was Danny and I being added to each others buddy list!  }
