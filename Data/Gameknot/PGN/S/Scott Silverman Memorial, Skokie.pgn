[Opening "Sicilian (B83), Scheveningen, 6.Be2"]

1. e4 c5 {I hate the sicilian and have an aweful track record against it.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e6 {A strange move order by my opponent.  This is the Scheveningen Sicilian which is rarely seen nowadays because of the Keres attack with 6. g4!? and its popularity in accelerating the KS attack with g4-g5 push coming.  This is certainly a way to play.  I was not too good on the theory of the keres at this time and so opted for a more positional set up} 6. Be2 Qc7 7. O-O Nc6 8. f4 {The thematic structure against the small center set up of black.} Nxd4 {? Releasing the tension in the center is almost always bad for the side doing so.  It is clea that my opponent hopes for some blunder after Qxd4 d5 Bd2?? Bc5 winning, but I am no tactical fool.} 9. Qxd4 d5 10. Be3 {Defending against the skewer, and developing actively} dxe4 {Another release of tension in the center by black.  White must certainly hold an edge here due to a lead in development and greater harmony and centralization afforded by black's antics.} 11. Nxe4 Be7 12. Nc3 {?! I don't really care for this move in retrospect, but was worried after say Rad1  some Nxe4 Qxe4 Bf6 garbage by black although concretely c3 should be fine} Bd7 13. Nb5 Bxb5 14. Bxb5+ {Gaining the bishop pair in an open center game.} Kf8 {Disrupting the harmony of the black rooks.  White holds a solid positional lead now.} 15. Qc4 {When I see that I have a better endgame, I simplify for it to try to grind out my edge.} Qxc4 16. Bxc4 Ng4 17. Bd4 b6 {This is a weak move by black.} 18. h3 Nh6 19. g4 {gaining space on the ks and restricting the black knight.  Black is in disarray. I am disgusted looking at this position that I was unable to convert this to a win, moreso that I went on to lose...} Rc8 20. Bd3 f6 21. a4 {I have been taught that the principle of second weakness is key to winning endings where one player has an edge in some way.  I have the bishop pair, but they need targets so I look to go a5 and weaken the black QS structure.  Furthermore, my 3 on 2 on the qs suggests I should aim for a passed pawn there} Bc5 {I saw this and allowed it because of...} 22. Bxc5+ Rxc5 23. b4 {This line allows me to speed up my pressure against the QS.  The BR has little room on the 5th and so should retreat} Rc7 24. a5 Ke7 25. axb6 axb6 26. Ra6 Rb8 27. b5 {Hammering the weak pawn in place.  However, a winning plan was Bxh7!! which is hard to justify after ...f5 seemingly trapping the bishop but it appears white gets out in time.  I thought for a good 15-20 minutes here and could not find a winning plan.  Such a shame when my opponent's position looks passive and dreadful.  No activity for any of his pieces!} g6 28. Kg2 Nf7 29. h4 {Keeping the 4-3 at bay on the KS.} Nd6 {Centralizing the bad piece, which is now just as good as my bishop.  A better plan for me was to double on the a file perhaps at an earlier stage.  I instead went for king centralization and simplification which is the wrong plan because  black can untie himself and quickly strike back} 30. Ra4 Nb7 31. Ra7 {I miscalculated this line as will be seen...} Rd7 32. Be4 Nc5 33. Rxd7+ Nxd7 34. Kf3 {And I thought I was still a bit better.  My edge has dropped substantially, if white is not careful he could quickly be lost.} Nc5 35. Rd1 {?} Nxe4 36. Kxe4 f5+ {!And black is better.} 37. Kf3 fxg4+ 38. Kxg4 Rc8 39. Ra1 {I panicked here and went for active looking counterplay against the black king} Kf6 40. Ra6 Rc3 {Threatening h5#} 41. h5 gxh5+ 42. Kxh5 Rc5+ 43. Kh6 Rxb5 44. Kxh7 Kf5 45. Ra4 Rc5 {And it is all over.  My king is boxed out and one of the black pawns will promote.} 46. Rb4 Rxc2 47. Rxb6 Rc4 48. Rb1 Rxf4 49. Kg7 e5 50. Kf7 e4 51. Rb5+ {Simply desperation.  At this point it is a matter of technique} Kg4+ 52. Ke6 e3 53. Rb1 Kg3 54. Ke5 Ra4 55. Rh1 Kg2 56. Rb1 e2 57. Rb2 Kf1 {0-1.  An aweful game where I let slip a solid advantage.}
