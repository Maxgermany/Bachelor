1. e4 {Standard Sicilian opening} c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 g6 {My opponent moved his g pawn to make space for his Bishop} 6. O-O Bg7 7. Nc3 Bxc3 {He used his Bishop for attack, freeing the g7 square. Later that square will prove very useful} 8. bxc3 Nf6 {At this point I still havent been noticed what opportunity my opponent has left me.} 9. c4 {For a better pawn structure} b5 10. Ne5 {The knight searches the best place - in this case it threatens the c6 pawn and protects c4} Bb7 11. cxb5 cxb5 12. Bh6 {I finally noticed what error my opponent has made. The square which he freed for his dark bishop now proves very useful for my one.} c4 13. Bg7 {Preventing my opponent from castling...} Rg8 14. Bxf6 {...and removing that knight which would make checkmating harder if left} exf6 15. Nf3 Kf8 {At that moment I was a bit dissapointed that my opponent will be able to castle his king anyway} 16. Nh4 {The method is now clear - an attack with a queen and a knight} cxd3 17. Qxd3 {Big mistake - it would be much better if I moved cxd3 instead. Now I have two isolated pawns and my opponent could have easily prevented the attack if he had exchanged the Qs} Qb6 18. Qa3+ {acting randomly to defend the two isolated pawns} Kg7 19. Rfe1 Rae8 20. e5 fxe5 21. Qc3 f6 {at glance an innocent move, but which has greatly influeced the end of the game} 22. Rad1 {at that moment I wasnt planning anything, I simply took the empty d file} Rec8 23. Rd7+ {and BOOM - the checkmate is now (almost) inevitable} Kh8 {the easiest (in my opinion) move to deal with} 24. Qh3 Rc7 {he still wasnt noticed the obvious threat} 25. Nxg6+ Rxg6 26. Qxh7# {}
