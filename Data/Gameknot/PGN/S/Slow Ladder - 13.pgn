[Opening "Queen's pawn game (D02)"]

1. d4 {1.d4, my favorite first move when playing White.} d5 {So, we have what is called the closed game. Closed games consist of 1.d4 d5, along with lines that transpose into this type of position.} 2. Nf3 {The most popular move here is 2.c4. It is very aggressive and strong and contends for control of the center. On the other hand, it can lead to the Nimzo Indian Defense, a very solid defense for Black. Thus, I usually avoid 2.c4 in this position. Instead I prefer the Reti Opening, 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 (or whatever Black chooses).} Nf6 {Good. You develop towards the center.  In the opening, it is best to move the minor pieces to control the four central squares, d4, d5, e4 & e5. It is not always the case, but usually, he who controls the center, controls the opening!} 3. g3 {In preparation to "fianchetto" my LSB. (See comment below). A bishop in this position is frequently very strong, since it is on the long diagonal. In the Reti, (although not in this game) White frequently fianchettoes both bishops.} Bf5 {Again you make moves to control the center. Good!} 4. Bg2 {The fianchetto...} Nc6 {Knight to the center.} 5. O-O {It is usually good to castle early. The king is less susceptible to attack.} e6 6. b3 {Preparing to fianchetto the other bishop, although I never did. Also, this move supports c4. } Bd6 7. c4 Nb4 {(?!) So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly. You would have been better to castle, continuing your development.} 8. Na3 {Defending c2. The knights are not best on the side of the board, but I plan to bring the knight to c2 after warding off your attack. My knight would have moved twice in the opening, (Na3, then Nc2) also not good, but you have also done the same, (Nc6, then Nb4) so it is not a real loss of development. At this point, we are tied in development. I have 9 development moves, while you only have 7. It is your move. If you choose to castle now, castling counts as 2 development moves giving you 9. This means I am temporarily ahead in development. Nathan, do you know how to count development moves? If not, send me a private message. I will go into more details then.} c6 9. Qd2 {(?) I wanted to attack the b4-knight, with the threat of c5(!) forcing the bishop to undefend the knight. But this move allows you to attack my queen, gaining development for you. I could have played Qe1 with the same benefit, without you being able to attack the queen.} Ne4 {(!) That's right, punish my error! I stated earlier "So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly..." This is an exception, because in moving this knight twice, you force me to move my queen twice. You advance while I retreat. } 10. Qe1 {Where I should have went the last move!} Be7 11. Nh4 {Trying to tempt you here. If 11...Bxh4 12.Qxb4 threatening Qxb7 and g3xh4. I also have the threat of Nxf5, messing up your pawn structure.} Qb6 {(?) So you did not fall for my intended trap (see note on my last move), but here you open a different can of worms for yourself. I think you would have been better to retreat your bishop to g6. If I play Nxg6 you play h7xg6, opening your h file to attack my king. Then you move your queen and castle queen side. The moves you played allowed me to win a knight for 2 pawns. I later won the pawns back leading to a whole piece lead.} 12. c5 {Now you have the option of playing 12...Qa5 or sacking you knight as you did. With Qa5, I would play 13.Nc2 winning the pinned knight. Playing Nxc5 loses a piece for 2 pawns. On the rare occasion this is okay, if your pawns are well backed up by pieces and are hard to stop. In this case, I had adequate defense to halt the pawns, and as mentioned previously, I won the pawns back anyway. } Nxc5 13. dxc5 Qxc5 14. Nxf5 {So I want to win some pawns back, that way I am up a whole piece. This trade doubles your pawns, making them less co-ordinated and easier to win. } exf5 15. Bd2 O-O-O 16. Qd1 d4 17. Rc1 {Rooks work best on open files, second best on semi - open files such as the c-file.} Qa5 18. Nc2 {I want to trade equal material, so that in the end game I have a bishop for 2 pawns, usually a won game.} Qb6 19. Nxb4 Bxb4 20. Bxb4 Qxb4 21. Qc2 {So you stated you saw the way I was attacking multiple points. I am threatening: 1. Bxc6, a sacrifice to gain access to your king. 2. Qxf5 +.} Qb5 {Good defence.} 22. a4 {Trying to deflect the queen from her post.} d3 {Nice Counter-attack!} 23. axb5 dxc2 {Now if I simply play Rxc2, I win another one of the pawns back and have an overwhelming attack on c6.} 24. bxc6 {(24.bxc6?) As mentioned, I should have played 24.Rxc2. Then I would still have more pressure on c6 than you can handle. The way I played, you had too much counter play, protecting your c2 pawn.} Rd2 {(!)} 25. cxb7+ Kb8 26. e3 {Not only to defend the pawn, but to give my bishop access to defend d1.} Rhd8 {Of course...} 27. Bf3 g5 {With a strong threat of g4.} 28. h3 {Stopping g4.} Rd8d3 29. Rfe1 {I want to play Re2 to contend with those rooks!} f6 {This does not accomplish anything, but you had nothing better really. It's interesting though, I am winning and all I need to do to pull it off i trade stuff off. Yet for the time being, you are very aggressive. Good job. } 30. Kg2 {Otherwise, 30.Re2 Rd1+ 31.Re1 RxcR 32. RxR Rd1+ uh-oh.} Rxb3 31. Re2 {Finally I get to do it. You have to trade rooks or give up your c pawn.} Rxe2 {Good for me either way.} 32. Bxe2 Rc3 {Gotta defend...} 33. Bf3 a5 34. Kf1 a4 {Now I need to get my king over, win the c pawn, trade rooks and get to stop that a pawn! } 35. Ke1 g4 36. Kd2 {Time is of the essence! My king is needed on the other side! You can't take the Bishop or the h pawn, so I ignore your threat!} Rc4 37. Bh1 {Gotta keep the bishop on the long diagonal, defending the b pawn, because the b pawn ties down your king. } gxh3 {Again, this does not accomplish anything, but you had nothing better.} 38. Rxc2 {Trying to trade, to get to the a file faster, and eliminate your defence.} Rc7 39. Rxc7 {Trade 'im off, Trade 'im off, Trade 'im off!} Kxc7 40. Kc3 h2 41. Kb4 {NOw it's just a matter of taking the a pawn and forcing your king away from the b8 square.} h6 42. Kxa4 Kb8 43. Kb5 Kc7 44. Kc5 {I did not play a6 here because that would force your king to c7 later, where he could run to the center of the board. I wanted to send him to the a file where he is easier to mate.} Kb8 45. Kc6 h5 46. f4 {To block your pawns up. I want to put you in "zugzwang", which means you are in a place where any move you make is bad.} h4 47. gxh4 {Zugzwang! The rest of the moves are forced!} Ka7 48. Kc7 Ka6 49. b8=Q Ka5 50. Qb3 {To force you back over to the king!} Ka6 51. Qa4# {Nathan, thanks for the game!}
