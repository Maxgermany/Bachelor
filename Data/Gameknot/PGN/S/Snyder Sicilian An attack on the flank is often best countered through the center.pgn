1. e4 c5 2. b3 {The Snyder Sicilian. Played before by none other than Nigel Short. The idea behind it is to get that bishop working against the Kingside.} Nc6 3. Nf3 e5 {Considered to be a testing move of White's idea - shutting the b2 bishop out of the game to strike back with a properly timed pawn break (f5, d5, or b5) from a Botvinnik type of position. The other common line runs along, for example, (3...d6 4.Bb5 Bd7 5.f4 a6 6.Bxc6 Bxc6).} 4. Bb2 d6 {Consolidating the central pawn formation. } 5. h3 {Often not necessary if played to block a pin on the knight. My intent was to play Be6 to prevent Bc4 thus damping the other other bishop and guard d5.} Be6 6. Nc3 g6 {The pawn formation is set - the followup plan for the Botvinnik formation includes Bg2, Nge2, O-O, and then looking to make the appropriate fore-mentioned pawn break.} 7. h4 {With White's advancement of the h-pawn, I felt that Nge2 would leave my defenses vulnerable to Ng5, h5. Thus, the plans had to be altered to better protect against a kingside rush.} Nf6 8. Ng5 Bg7 {But what about Nxe6 and doubling your pawns and getting the bishop? I wasn't too concerned - doubled  pawns would work to my benefit - opening the f-file and fortifying the center.} 9. f3 O-O 10. g4 {White begins the flank pawn storm - the best counter is most often to fight back through a strong center, which is supported by superior development.} d5 11. Nxe6 fxe6 12. g5 {This was a mistake as the flank attack now fizzles...} Nh5 {The knight can park here for quite a while to blockade the weak pawn. It's not so dim as f4 and g3 are attractive possibilities.} 13. exd5 {Another positional mistake - it supports Black's broad pawn center. Better was to finish piece development (the light squared bishop) and to get the king to safety.} exd5 14. Rh2 e4 {Giving up the pawn to bring the heavy artillery to bear down on the exposed king (rooks in the center, queen in the center ready to jump into the king's corner).} 15. fxe4 Qd6 16. Rh3 Rae8 17. d3 dxe4 {Again, blasting open the center.} 18. dxe4 {If instead 18.d4 then 18...Rxf1+ 19.Kxf1 Rf8+ with multiple threats. The pawn on e4 is pretty much the only brick left for White's King and guarded by Nc3 which can now be removed.} Bxc3+ 19. Rxc3 Rxe4+ 20. Be2 {And White is lost.} Ng3 {Attacking the pinned bishop (while guarded by Qd6)} 21. Rxg3 Qxg3+ 22. Kd2 Rd8+ {And White resigned.}
