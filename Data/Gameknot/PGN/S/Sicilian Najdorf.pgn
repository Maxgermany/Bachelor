1. e4 {This was a blitz game I played quite recently in which I employed my new opening of choice: the Sicilian Najdorf. I took too much time on the first 15-20 moves so I ran into time pressure pretty early but I managed to secure an advantage and win the game.} c5 {My standard opening against 1.e4. } 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 {A strange move order but not bad. } Nf6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 a6 {The Sicilian Najdorf. } 6. Bg5 {The most common response to the Najdorf. } e6 7. Bc4 {This was an irregular move as f4 followed up by Qf3 is the main line. } Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. Bd3 {I can't say I like this move as it is moving the bishop twice but since the bishop would have to move after b5 it is not bad. I prefer Re1.} b5 10. Qe2 {Defending e4 and developing the queen. } Bb7 {Trying to put pressure on e4. } 11. e5 {This move was a mistake and allows me to tactically expose the bishop on g5. } dxe5 12. Qxe5 Ng4 {Attacking the bishop and the queen. If Bxe7 then 13....Nxe5 14. Bxd8 Rxd8 and after the d4 knight moves I cannot take the pawn immediately because of Nc5 but this pawn is a weakness which I will exploit. } 13. Qf4 Bxg5 14. Qxg4 Re8 {Here I wanted to play f5 and then try to play e5. However, there were two major flaws to my plan. A) after 14....f5 15.Qg3 e5 Nd6 wins the g5 bishop. B) f5 hangs after e5. Although it is relatively early in the game, I was already in time pressure and failed to take into account the latter of these problems. I played Re8 in anticipation of the first issue. } 15. Rad1 Qf6 {I was worried about a discovered attack on my queen and made my first major mistake in the game. I also thought that my bishop on b7 gave me some attacking chances so moving the queen to the kingside seemed logical. White's best move is Ne4 giving me  several problems. } 16. Nf3 {This was a mistake because I am able to double white's pawns and create a weakness in the white camp. } Bxf3 17. Qxf3 Qxf3 18. gxf3 Nc6 {I had considered  Bf6 in order to double whites pawns again but I was behind in development so I opted for this move. White can pin my knight with Be4 but I didn't think it could cause me any large problems. } 19. Ne4 {I like this because it is preparing a check on f6 after Kh1 and Rg1. } Be7 {Making Nf6+ impossible and leaving the possibility of bringing the Bf8 to defend open. } 20. f4 {Preventing e5 followed by f6 or f5. } Rac8 {I was trying to create some tactics based on a discovered attack on c2. } 21. Kh1 {Preparing Rg1. } Red8 22. Rfg1 Nd4 {This move is inferior to Nb4. It does create a discovered attack on c2 but I could have achieved more with Nb4 also making threats on d3. } 23. Nc3 Nxc2 {Ultimately this move was a mistake. After 23....Nxc2 24.Bxc2 b4 25.Rxd8+ Bxd8 26.Rg3 bxc3 27.Rxc3 Rxc3 28bxc3 leads to an opposite colored bishop endgame.  Better was the immediate b4. } 24. Bxc2 b4 25. Rxd8+ Bxd8 26. Ne4 {This was the losing move. It allows me to win a pawn and put my rook on the seventh rank. } Rxc2 27. Rd1 Be7 28. Rd7 Bf8 29. Ra7 Rxb2 30. Rxa6 b3 {White must take on b3 or I will queen my pawn. } 31. axb3 Rxb3 32. Ra8 Rb4 33. Nd6 {The correct move is Nc5 because it is preparing Nd7. } Rxf4 34. Kg2 Rd4 35. Nc8 g6 {I was so focused on getting the king of  my first rank I missed Rd8. } 36. Ne7+ Kg7 37. Nc6 Rd5 {By putting the rook here I prevent Ne5 followed by Ra7. } 38. Ra7 Bc5 39. Rc7 Rd2 {Preparing Rxf2+. } 40. Ne5 Rxf2+ 41. Kg3 Bb6 {Better was 41. .....Bd6 42. Rd7 Rd2. } 42. Rc6 Bd4 {Rb2 was much better.} 43. Ng4 Ra2 {Getting the rook to safety. } 44. Rc4 Bf6 {Because I am up in material exchanges are good for me. } 45. Nxf6 Kxf6 46. Rf4+ Kg7 47. Kg4 {This mistake allows me to trap his king and weave a mating net. } Ra3 48. h4 {This allows black to win immediately. } h5+ 49. Kg5 Ra5+ {White resigned because of 49. Rf5 Rxf5# }
