1. e4 c5 2. d4 {Smith mora gambit} cxd4 {... accepted by black} 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3 {I like this variation. White has got a big hole on the left side but two pieces out against none for black.} e6 5. Bc4 {Developping quickly is necessary to take profit from the gambit.} Nc6 6. Nf3 {all very classical} Bb4 7. Bd2 {I do not like that kind of move very much but it's necessary to avoid 7. ... Bxc3 8. bxc3 with isolated pawn on c.} Nge7 8. O-O O-O {The position is rather equilibrated : white is a bit better in the center but black has material advantage due to the gambit.} 9. a3 {To fire the bishop.} Bc5 {I'm not sure it's a good move (the bishop will have to move twice). On the other hand, the DSB occupates a good diagonal.} 10. b4 {Away ! (advancing the pawns on the left side seems a good idea anyway).} Bb6 11. Qc1 Nd4 {Trading on the center, not good for white who is one pawn late.} 12. Nxd4 Bxd4 13. Be3 Nc6 {some protection for the attacked bishop} 14. b5 {advancing on the Queen side.} Bxe3 15. Qxe3 {The situation is still equilibrated : white is more developed and stronger in the center but black has the material advantage and is still solid.} Ne5 16. Qd4 {strong move which can get quickly pretty dangerous.} Qf6 17. Rad1 {Aiming at the d file.} Qg5 {blunder.} 18. f4 {weakening the king (the h1 a8 diagonal is opened and white DSB has gone.) but white win a knight and black's DSB has gone as well. So that it seemed ok.} Qe7 {The lady has to go back home.} 19. Qxe5 Qxa3 {Alone, the black queen cannot be that dangerous if white pays attention.} 20. Ne2 Qe3+ {Fruitless attack} 21. Kh1 {The king has to hide} d5 {Now black counterattacks} 22. Bd3 {grouping all the pieces at the center to attack the kingside} Qc5 23. Ng3 {gaining terrain on the king side} f6 {Weakening  the king} 24. Qh5 g6 {weakening the king} 25. Qg4 e5 {Weakening the king but it begins to get dangerous and annoying for white.} 26. f5 Kh8 {Both kings are cornered.} 27. Rdc1 {To drive the black lady away and limitate the risk of counterattack} Qd6 {The white queen } 28. Qh4 {to unpin the queen and menace h7} g5 29. Qh6 {I hesitated a long time for the queen has now few squares to draw back but black has no more DSB and his knights are dead as well, so that it will be hard to attack the queen.} d4 {Black secures the central pawns} 30. Nh5 {Mate menace} Qe7 31. Rc2 {Now the king side and center are blocked. White's plan is to double the rooks and attack on the c open file.} Bd7 {To join the rooks} 32. Rfc1 {occupying strongly the open file} Rf7 33. Bc4 {launching the attack on the queen file} Qf8 34. Qxf8+ {No choice but white has a little material advance and a better position, so that the trade is not so bad.} Rfxf8 35. Be6 {abandoning the poor lonesome b pawn to his doom} Bxb5 36. Rc2c7 {Now the attack is launched} Bc6 {White oversaw this move.} 37. Bd5 Rac8 38. Rxc8 {Another trade but as white is in advance, it's not so bad for him.} Rxc8 39. Bxc6 {Black likes trading, let's carry on} bxc6 40. Nxf6 {White has a wining game if he prevents black to promote his right wing pawns.} c5 41. Kg1 {The king comes to help.} Rc7 42. Nd5 {Everybody is mobilised to prevent the promotion of the black pawns.} Rc6 43. Kf2 {The boss has to give the example} d3 44. Ke3 {No pasaran} c4 45. g4 {Blocking the kingside. White doesn't want to need a piece there} a5 46. Nc3 Rd6 47. Nd1 {So that the rook is not needed any longer to stop the c and d pawns} Rd4 48. Ra1 d2 {Less dangerous than it seems.} 49. Rxa5 Kg7 {To prevent the mate menace 50. f6 ... 51. Ra8} 50. Rd5 {Now it's finished for black.} c3 51. Nxc3 Kf6 {Black can trade the rooks but the d pawn cannot be save.} 52. Rxd4 {Black submited here.}
