1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {Fighting the Pirc Defense against a 1900+ player. This can get deep very quickly. } 4. Be2 {A quiet yet flexible move. I decided the Austrian Attack was too flashy. Be2 allows me to transpose to a few different variations.} Bg7 5. f3 {Redundancy or overprotection?} O-O 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Nh3 {I am able to do this without fear as the c8-Bishop is temporarily blocked.} c5 8. d5 {Choosing to keep the center closed while grabbing space. } a6 {Preparing the Pawn Storm. } 9. a4 {This pawn will be very important in the upcoming conflict.} b6 10. Nf2 Qc7 {Supports a push on the c-file. Also prepares for checking tactics along the a6-f1 and a7-g1 diagonals once my King castles short. Castling long would be lunacy.  } 11. O-O Bb7 {Both Black Bishops are fianchettoed. If my pawns are weakened I will be prone to sniper attacks from both long diagonals. Furthermore, the Rooks are connected. Black's strategic ideas are made clear. He wants to continue advancing Queenside, possibly trade Rooks grabbing the a-file and either pin or skewer the c3-Knight or force it off the edge of the board using the dark-squared Bishop. On the other hand, I want to remove the active dark-squared Bishop, hold the center and forge through the middle as Black's flank attacks run out of fuel. I usually have good results with ascending pawn chain formations so I think I can last a while here. } 12. Qd2 Rac8 13. b3 {Creating a temporary skewering liability to stave off a c4 push. I probably should have played Bh6 first but I was not making deep analyses in this very short game. } Rfe8 {Yep. I should have played Bh6 first. } 14. Bh6 Bh8 {The Bishop still lives.} 15. Rab1 {Protecting the Rook. } e6 {Black begins to contest my center. } 16. Bc4 {The next series of moves were made instinctively as the clock dipped under a the minute mark. } Ne5 17. Ng4 {Ng4?: 18... Nfxg4 19.fxg4 Nxg4 and I go down in material.} Nxc4 {Black missed it too. } 18. Nxf6+ Bxf6 19. bxc4 exd5 20. Nxd5 Bxd5 21. cxd5 c4 22. Be3 Rcb8 23. c3 {Success! I held the center after the first major onslaught. } b5 24. axb5 axb5 25. Bd4 Bxd4+ 26. Qxd4 Qc5 27. Qxc5 {I realize now I could have gained a tempo with Rd1 instead. } dxc5 28. Rfd1 b4 29. cxb4 cxb4 {Thinking has now resumed. This is disturbing. I now need to get the King into the fray to hold off these passed pawns. Sigh. I wish I had that extra tempo now. } 30. Kf2 b3 31. Rdc1 Rb4 32. Ke3 f5 33. Rc3 fxe4 34. fxe4 Kf7 35. Rb2 {Covering all my pawns.} Ke7 36. Kd4 Rc8 37. e5 {Short on ideas; short on time. I wanted to keep some distance between our Kings for now.} Kd7 38. g4 Ra4 {Black's queenside pawns are untouchable because the follow-up Rook exchanges will end badly for me.} 39. h3 {Buying time on the Kingside. For example: h5, gxf5 gxf5, h4 Ra2, Rbxb3 cxb3, Rxb3 with a -3 deficit but keeping a Rook, the central pawns and cleaning up the Queenside threats. There were probably sharper lines against me but at least I could run down Black's clock.} Ra2 40. e6+ {A decisive move that came from nowhere! I'm still not sure I myself saw it! I bait the King with the central pawns to remove the c-pawn and the powerful Rook behind it. With a Rook positioned on the 8th rank I can better fight the b-pawn and its escort.} Kd6 {Any move ...} 41. Rbxb3 cxb3 42. Rxc8 {At the end of this combination I began to feverishly look for a checkmate. I could not spot any with under 16 seconds to spare. But I could force an advantage.} Rc2 {An exchange loses for me: Rxc2 bxc2, any move c1=Q} 43. Rd8+ Ke7 44. Rd7+ Ke8 45. Rxh7 {A precautionary capture as a prelude to Rb7 (or Rb8). This highlights the power of a Rook BEHIND a pawn vs a Rook ahead of it. I even entertain the idea of my own pawn promotion!} b2 46. Rh8+ Ke7 47. Rb8 Rh2 48. Rb7+ Ke8 49. e7 {Black's position is lost. The winning moves here will be d6 and Rb8+.} Re2 {I prefer the continuation b1=Q, Rxb1 Kxe7 for Black. It stops the promotion, grabs a little more central space and keeps a tag on the h-pawn.} 50. d6 {As planned. Now comes a series of checks.} Rd2+ 51. Kc5 Rc2+ 52. Kd5 Rd2+ 53. Ke6 Re2+ 54. Kf6 Rf2+ 55. Kxg6 {The Black Rook is out of ammo now. } Rh2 56. Rb8+ {Resignation.}
