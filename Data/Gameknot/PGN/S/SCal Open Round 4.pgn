1. d4 {Playing Black is my friend I go to tournaments with. He doesn't play on gameknot anymore but his annotations are still here. I saw this game live while walking around during my opponent's turn. It was a wild position and great ending.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {This important move in the King's indian Defense stops e5 and prepares for a central break later with e5 or c5, sometimes both.} 5. f3 {This differs from the main line where White plays Nf3 Be2 O-O. In this variation (Saemisch) White solidifies the center and keeps options open for maybe castling queenside and doing a kingside pawnstorm, or trying to get an advantage with the bolstered pawn center} O-O {Baker usually plays for an attack like e5 Nh5 f5, but that attack is only good in the main line where White castles kingside quickly. This variation is more positional since White's pawns are more solid, and Baker and I both reccomend the positional c5-break over the tactical e5-break in variations where White moves his f-pawn early.} 6. Be3 c5 {Yes, Black is offering to give up a pawn. Most players who know Saemisch well will not accept the pawn and instead play Nge2 hoping for cxd4 Nxd4 with a Maroczy Bind. If White accepts the pawn, then Black gets a lot of positional compensation. After dxc5 dxc5 Bxc5 Nc6, White's position is cramped and Black has a big lead in development. If you know this opening well then you know that accepting the gambit is not advisable.} 7. d5 {Instead of going for a maroczy bind, White avoids trading a central pawn for a flank pawn. This position is like the Benoni Defense, except that Black has not played e6-exd5 yet.} e6 {Black wants to open the e-file for his rook and free up some space. White can choose whether he wants to trade his e-pawn, d-pawn, or c-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Swapping off both e-pawns is not good because Black's open e-file will be stronger. 8.dxe6 Bxe6 9.Nb5 Ne8 is also comfortable for Black. (10.Bxc5 won't work because of Qa5 )} 8. Qd2 {White's best bet is to let Black trade his central pawn for the flank pawn.} exd5 9. cxd5 {Usually making this kind of pawn swap favors the player with more central pawns, but White's center is contained, Black now has queenside pawn majority, and can break up White's center with f5 later.} Nbd7 {In the lines where White leaves the pawn on d4 and keeps dxc5 an option, Black develops this knight to c6 and plays Ne5 if d5. In this variation where White plays d5 early, this is pretty much the only square to develop to. The idea of Na6-Nc7 planning a b5 advance takes too long and isn't that strong.} 10. Nge2 {The position is cramped, so there will be a lot of positional maneuvering. Usually closed positions like this have an explosive ending once everything is opened up.} Ne5 {Threatening Nc4-Nxe3 giving Black the bishop pair and also weakens White's dark squares.} 11. Ng3 {Perhaps Nc1 was better because I don't think White has enough play for a kingside attack. } a6 12. a4 {Stopping b5 expansion} h5 {Since White has stopped expansion on the queenside, Black turns toward the kingside.} 13. Be2 {h4 stops the h-pawn's advance, but Nh7-f5 expansion can still be played} h4 14. Nf1 Nh7 {Black plans to weaken a lot of his kingside playing f5, but he has pieces to cover those weaknesses, and White isn't in a position to take advantage of them.} 15. Qc1 {making room for Nd2 so that knight can recapture after f5-fxe4} f5 16. Nd2 fxe4 17. Ndxe4 h3 {breaking open the kingside} 18. O-O {this is probably white's best idea, clump the pieces around the weaknesses about to be created.} hxg2 19. Kxg2 Qh4 {Baker admits that this move wasn't the best, all it does is threaten Bh3  winning the exchange, after Kh1 the queen's position in White's camp isn't really dangerous} 20. Kh1 Nf7 {defending d6} 21. Rg1 Bf5 {Black's main advantage here is the majority of pieces controlling the kingside. Black should continue to clump the pieces around the kingside. The maneuvering will be slow, but as long as White can't do anything, Black has time to prepare a kingside attack. } 22. Qd2 {a5-Na4-Nb6 would cramp Black's queenside, but it isn't very dangerous as long as Black has control of the kingside where all the action is. The queenside is pretty much contained. White needs to make room for his rook to get active to match Black's piece play.} Rae8 23. Bf2 Qe7 {After Black retreats his misdeveloped queen, all of his pieces are clumped together and ready to make progress. White's pieces are spread out across the board and are not well coordinated. It looks like this will be a positional squeeze, which is common in positions where no pieces have been traded yet.} 24. Rae1 Qd7 {the queen does not belong on an open file when there are still rooks on the board.} 25. a5 {The Na4-Nb6 idea mentioned earlier might be White's only chance to generate some play. Black has secured all the weaknesses left with the advancing of h and f-pawns, so now it's time to make progress with the minor pieces.} Nf6 26. Ng3 {26.Nxf6 heavily increases the strength of Black's dark-squared bishop. I thought it was better if White tries to maintain the knight on e4 rather than defending passively. If the knight stays on e4, then it's harder for Black's minor pieces to make progress} Bh6 {This takes advantage of the e-file White cleared up, and Black gains a tempo in the coordination of the minor pieces. f4 is weakening to the light squares and not advisable, White should retreat the queen to d1 to support the Na4-Nb6 plan, which is White's last chance to generate some play.} 27. Qd1 Ne5 {Black's minor pieces suddenly become dangerous. Minor pieces rule positions where little or no captures have been made, since the major pieces are too valuable to try to attack yet. Major pieces become active once everything's been opened up.} 28. Na4 Bh3 {If Bf1, then Nxf6 and Black has too many tactics.} 29. Nb6 Qf7 {Black's pieces are beginning to reach their optimal squares to start an attack. Black has a lot of pressure on the f-file, so Nfg4 is coming.} 30. Qa4 {This sneakily gains a lot of control over the 4th rank, to maybe disrupt my kingside progression} Nfg4 {After fxg4 Qxf2, Black has the major threat of Nf3. If White defends f3 with the queen, then Nf3 is still crushing after Bxf3 Rxe1} 31. Ne4 {White loses the very weak f-pawn, and also gets his rooks forked, but he had to defend the bishop, and the position is still very complicated.} Nxf3 {Along with forking the rooks, this also threatens Rxe4, and White cannot play Nxd6 due to Nxf2#} 32. Rxg4 {This is pretty much the best solution to stopping all the threats, because if Bxg4 then Nxd6.} Nxe1 {White still cannot play Nxd6 because of Qxf2 and White will get mated, and taking the knight allows Bxg4, where Black is up 2 exchanges, and has loads of tactics on the open files that will secure a large material advantage or trade off into a simple endgame.} 33. Nd7 {This is White's only chance for counterplay. Rh4 allows Bg2  Kg1 Rxe4! and retreating the rook to g1 allows Bg2  Rxg2 Nxg2 with ideas like Rxe4 then Qxf2} Qf5 {Black should get his queen out in the open before Nf6  otherwise Black has to spend a lot of tempo, and White's pieces have coordinated and are beginning to generate counterplay. From here on, every move must be active, and both players need to be tactically alert, this is an ultra-sharp position and if Black doesn't play accurately, White may have enough counterplay to get a perpetual or recover enough of the material disadvantage to hold a draw, maybe even mate Black.} 34. Ndf6+ Kh8 35. Nxe8 {White shouldn't try saving the g4-rook, because Black can reinforce the Bg2  Rxe4 idea while trading off into a simpler ending. White wants the position to remain as complicated as possible, giving him every cheapo chance he can get, and giving Black the most opportunities to screw up. } Bxg4 {If 35.Bxe1, then 35...Bxe2 is simple and Black's queen and bishops are too much for White to handle. White is lost so now he needs to figure out which lines give him the most cheapo possibilities before he becomes totally lost in an unswindlable position. If N8xd6, then Bf6  Kg1 Qg4  and White cannot block with the knight, so if Bg3 then Be3  Kf1 Bxe2   Kxe1 Rf1#, and if Kf1 after Qg4 , then Bxe2  Kxe1 Rxf2! and White's king cannot escape the queen and 2 bishops. Another idea for Black is Bf6  Kg1 Qh3 Bf1 Bg2 intending Nf3#} 36. Bxg4 {Taking the bishop is the only active move. If Bd4  instead, then Black wins easily after cxd4 Qxd4  Qe5, Black is up a whole rook with many tactical threats} Qxg4 {Black threatens Qg2#, and if Bxe1 then Rf1#, so White must check every move now} 37. Bd4+ {This is tricky, because if cxd4 Qxd4  White will play Nf6  once the king moves. If Black moves his king now, then White still plays Nf6 , so is Black suddenly losing? did Black miscalculate and didn't see this move when he went for the mate? What does Black do here? How can he escape this?} Rf6 {White resigned, because after Bxf6  Kg8, White has no more checks and Black will play Qg2#. White can stop mate by hanging the queen with Qc2, but Black should still win easily having a queen for a knight.}
