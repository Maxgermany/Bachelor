1. e4 {I'm playing black in this game, and, of course i play sicilian} c5 {c5! is the most popular reply to e4. i just play it because it looks cool but technically speaking...this move takes initiative in fighting for center. } 2. Nf3 {Nf3, Nc3, Bf4 are all playable. All of them contribute to fight for the center } d6 {Sicilian!! this move stops the advancing of the White's e pawn and looks cool} 3. d4 {these all are book moves so far. cxd4 Nxd4 give white a better control of the center.} cxd4 {I stick with the book and play cxd4 and temporarily give White that "edge" over me.} 4. Nxd4 {of course} Nc6 {Nc6 challenges the White knight's position and also helps me develop looking cool at the same time :P} 5. Nc3 {hmm this move isn't necessary at this stage..maybe Bb5 to pin my knight??} Nf6 {White still has a better center but i have a solid cool looking defense.} 6. f3 {premature? Bc4 or Bb5 were still playable} e6 {The ultimate cool move!!!!!! This is my version of Sicilian Scheveningen variation. see even the name sounds cool...i recommend it to all the players who want to make their fortress and pieces look "cool". This is my favorite Sicilian variation by far!!} 7. Be3 {White makes a good development getting ready to exploit my king side.} Be7 {This is the Scheveningen. Welcome to sicilianunleash's world and eat Scheveningen all day. Ok enough of retardedness, techinically speaking this move adds to my defense and also allows me to castle without fianchettoeing the bishop that takes time } 8. g4 {a king side pawnstorm...not good not good should i castle or should i come up with some other plan?} O-O {Heck...i don't wanna kill my brain trying to think of plans. Chess is not about thinking or planning it's all about making your pieces look cool no?} 9. Qd2 {ok here it comes. white is ready to launch a fierce attack on me and make sure he's king is safe at same time! and i was worrying if my pieces look cool or not...man..i suck} d5 {i finally make some attempt to steal the centre of from wild} 10. O-O-O {Now white's setup is complete..and it looks cooler than mine} Bb4 {i try to break through the coolness...technically speaking...i was trying to win a pawn by 1)Bxc3 Qxc3 2)dxe4 fxe4 3) Nxe4..giving my knight a good post } 11. Nxc6 {a bit of surprise here..he shouldn't have traded his well..posted knight} bxc6 {yes i would like to re-capture. Thank you very much} 12. h4 {uh-oh i smell trouble this king side pawn storm might prove fatal..i have to break it} Bb7 {and this is what i come up with....sorry i was retarded that day} 13. e5 {White advances in my territory and makes my knight run} Nd7 14. f4 {i can't think of any solutions here...this pawn storm is getting on my nerves} c5 {i decided to start my own pawn storm...an eye for an eye} 15. g5 {White advances...but wouldn't h5 be better?} g6 {This temporarily stops the threat of my king dieing } 16. h5 {uh- oh i thought that was enough to stop the action but apparently not} Bc6 {i try to take his attention off} 17. hxg6 {but in vain :(} fxg6 {hxg5 would have been baad as i would have diiieeed after Qh2} 18. Qh2 {oh did i say Qh2...here she comes...to rape my king the the corner} Rf7 {have to stop the queen...my king is still a virgin} 19. Bb5 {action moves to queen side...he's hoping i forget about my king..NEVER} Bb7 {sorry..i can't let you have the bishop pair :)} 20. Bd3 {-_- just wasted two moves on nothing...no wait a minute he was suppose to go back to Bf1!! he cheated!!} Rg7 {i stop Bxg6 which spells instant death for me} 21. Nb5 {irrelevant action } d4 {i hope he doesn't see it} 22. Bxg6 {and he didn't} Bxh1 {BAM i snipe the rook} 23. Rxh1 {damn another one comes} Nf8 {i save the mate..barely. lucky my knight was there to offer sevice} 24. Be4 {payback? no sorry can't get my rook} Rb8 25. Nd6 {argh...i don't like the knight there..do i hate it that much that i'll hang my queen for it?} dxe3 {nahh i'll just take the free piece} 26. g6 {aww come on not again...} Qb6 {ok stop killing my king..pay attention to your own} 27. gxh7+ {what? is that allowed?you can't do that!!..forcing my king into the corner so you can molest him} Kh8 {flee!!!} 28. b3 {There you go..} c4 {your pawn is mine!!} 29. Qh5 {Nf7 and i lose..} Bxd6 {sorry you had to die} 30. exd6 Qd4 {bishop...you were pissing me off} 31. Bf3 {oops...i didn't say i was gonna kill you} Qa1# {BAM...R.I.P mr King...you didn't squat throughout the game...hope you like the game...i never annotated before....ignore some of the comments...i was sleepy :P and i'll take your feedback and comments without offense so you can diss/ insult  me if you want :P}
