1. d4 b6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. Nbd2 g6 5. e4 Bg7 6. c3 Nd7 7. Qa4 a6 8. c4 {An antinatural move that seeks to control b5 for the queen, if needed. } e6 {Black doesn't want to close the bishop's action after the d5 pawn moves.} 9. Rb1 {Now I disrupt all my planned game, revert my attack on the queenside.} Ne7 {No hope to avoid him to catle far from the danger...} 10. d5 {...so let's try something.} e5 11. Be3 {Now, tell me how is going black to move his knights...} O-O 12. g3 {My lsb will find a nice place on h3, while it has no way out the main diagonal. } h6 {Just waiting. } 13. h4 {...so let's be more aggressive. The plan is Ke2, to join the rooks on the kinside... so I switch back to the kingside attack plan... without the queen. But all the black pieces are completely blinded, and his only way out is f5. } f5 14. Bh3 {Choosing the "weird" one, always. If4, I can open the g column for my attack. } Nf6 {Threatening e4.} 15. exf5 Nxf5 16. Bxf5 {Opening the g column. It's not all, but it's something. } gxf5 17. Qc2 {Covering e4, threatening f5 and making the queen participate in the attack. } Ng4 18. Ke2 {I'll lose the dsb, but this helps me connecting the rooks, while 0-0 was out of question. } Nxe3 19. fxe3 {Now my king is weak... I know. } Qf6 20. Rbf1 {Well, this actually favours me. I'm looking where to move the knight... } Rae8 {My opponent didn't. } 21. g4 {Necessary to open the way to h7. } fxg4 {He takes the bite. } 22. Ng5 {The threat of Qh7# is decisive. } Qxf1+ {Only way out. Now, with NxQ, hxN, hxg5, white's attack goes on. But white blunders...} 23. Rxf1 {??} hxg5 24. hxg5 {? Better was Rh1. } Rxf1 25. Nxf1 {Now I have to care for the g pawn...} Bc8 {And now, white is just +1, the black's lsb is starting to breath again... but the dsb is completely trapped and useless. } 26. Qg6 {Let's buzz him a little... not leaving tempo to organize. } Rf8 27. Ng3 {No threat from the unsupported rook on the f file. } Bd7 28. Nh5 {Forced sequence black couldn't stop. } Rf7 29. Nf6+ Kf8 30. Nxd7+ Rxd7 31. e4 {Blocking the black bisop for the rest of the game.} Rf7 32. Qe6 {The queen is slippery...} g3 33. Qc8+ Ke7 34. Qxc7+ Kf8 {?? ...anyway, after Ke8, white can go on taking pawns and still stop the g pawn, with a little care...} 35. Qd8# {Only +2... thank you for reading! :-)}
