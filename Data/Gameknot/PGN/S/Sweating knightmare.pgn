1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 g6 {Stronger seems Nh5. If I don't want to take the bishop back, I go Bg3, accepting the exchange to use the h file. } 3. Nf3 d5 4. h3 {Now I can save the bishop, just in case. It is not regarded as good. } Bg7 5. e3 {I don't want to push the center, nor with e4, nor with c4. } Ne4 6. c3 {This knight here is not so useful as it seems. But his twin will become black's more active piece. } O-O 7. g4 {Just to avoid to support the knight with the bishop. } Nd7 {Preparing to support the knight. } 8. Bd3 b6 {Indirectly looking for protecting the knight. } 9. Qc2 Bb7 10. Nbd2 {Accepted. Now, he has to take it, and I don't bother at all to lose my inactive N.} Nxd2 11. Kxd2 {Surprise. I want to connect the rooks ASAP :-)} Nf6 12. Rag1 {Sweating, since I knew what was coming.} Ne4+ 13. Kc1 {I won't take it. It will only favour him. } Rc8 {Oh, yes, I know where are you aiming at. } 14. Kb1 c5 15. g5 {Better was the othe pawn, h5. Anyway, the issue is to surprise him (with not that bad moves).} cxd4 16. exd4 Bxd4 17. Nxd4 {Interesting, but I can't see the advantage black has with these exchanges. } e5 {It seems logical to prepare it first. } 18. Bxe5 Nxg5 {Opening the po(i)sition for me? Thank you!} 19. Qd2 {I have to "take" those black diagonals. My queen must come into the game.} Ne4 20. Qh6 Nf6 {f6 was impossible because of Rxg6+, hxR, Qxg6+, Kh8, Nf5 and I win. Now, Bxg6, fxB, Rxg6+, hxR, Qxg6+, Kh8, BxN+, winning. But I saw another good move, thinking it was definitive.} 21. Nf5 {I was wrong. } Nh5 {Desperate defence, since I can play straight away QxN. Of course it was a blunder, since Ne8 would have worked much better. Anyway, the Bxg6 sac would have worked all the same.} 22. Ng3 f6 {forced or mate. } 23. Bd4 {Now black can defend on the 7ยบ row, so there is still a game to play. Anyway, white threats NxN and Bxg6, so black is kind of forced to play  NxN, RxN, Rc7, Rh-g1 and white gets enough firepower to win. My opponent resigned. }
