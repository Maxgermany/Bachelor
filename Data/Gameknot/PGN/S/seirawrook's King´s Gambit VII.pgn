1. e4 {Another short game in this King's Gambit tournament. Analysis can be found at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19859834&fb=1  } e5 2. f4 {Starting point} exf4 {I think this was the first game where I took the pawn and it worked out well for me} 3. Bc4 Nc6 4. Nf3 Bc5 {The computer prefers Nf6 here but I wanted to hinder whites ability to castle} 5. d3 {Computer calls this an inaccuracy preferring d4 which is what I was expecting.} Qf6 {This may seem premature but I didn't want to play g5 as it blocked my queens access to h4} 6. Nc3 Nge7 {Preparing to castle. The knight can also be brought in to defend the f4 pawn if needed} 7. a3 {The computer calls this an inaccuracy preferring 7. Na4 Be3 8. Bxe3 fxe3 9. Qe2 Rb8. Personally I can't see the real point of it.} d6 {opens the diagonal for my lsb to come to g4 pinning the white rook to the queen} 8. Bd2 {The computer calls this an inaccuracy preferring 8. e5 Nxe5 9. Ne4 Qf5 10. Nh4 Qd7. I think white was feeling a little cramped here} Bg4 {If the white knight stays pinned I can threaten it with Nd4. I can get my queen in to h4 which I am hoping will cause big problems for white.} 9. Qe2 {The computer calls this a blunder, at the time it helped me with my plan} Nd4 10. Qd1 {Computer calls this a blunder preferring 10. e5 Qh6 11. Qe4 Nxc2+ 12. Ke2 Bxf3+  I was quite happy, my biggest problem was should I take the white knight with my knight or the bishop} Nxf3+ {I eventually went with the knight, note that the knight is immune to gxf3 as we will see} 11. gxf3 {Unfortunately for white he didn't see it and it's now mate in 2 -  11. gxf3 Qh4+ 12. Ke2 Qf2#  The computer prefers  11. Qxf3 Bxf3 12. gxf3 Qh4+ 13. Kd1 Qf2 14. Kc1 Qxf3 15. Rd1 Qf2 16. Nb5 Rc8 17. b4 Be3 18. Bxe3 Qxe3+} Qh4+ {Thanks for reading please comment and rate}
