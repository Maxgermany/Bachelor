1. c4 {I'll try the Reti Opening} c5 {Sicilian?} 2. Nc3 {the normal second move} e6 {planning for d5 next?} 3. e3 {I know I want d4 next!} Nc6 {thwarting an immediate d4...} 4. Nf3 {so I make preparations} h6 {I don't understand this one... it's not like Bg5 is a threat} 5. d4 {I test the waters} cxd4 {he don't want me there} 6. exd4 {I persist} d6 {he allows me some center control} 7. Be3 {I fortify the d4 pawn} Be7 {I suppose he's preparing to castle} 8. Bd3 {me too} Nf6 {now we're both ready} 9. O-O {my king is safely tucked away} a6 {another move that puzzles me} 10. Qa4 {pins the knight (just because I could)} Bd7 {additional protection (and a potential for a "free" move from an uncovered attack on my queen)} 11. Qc2 {I run away (should have stopped on b3?)} d5 {a battle for center control begins} 12. c5 {I pass...} b6 {he's not happy with that} 13. a3 {I prepare to support the c5 pawn with b4 next} b5 {he didn't want to trade after all!} 14. b4 {I support c5 anyway} Qb8 {I don't understand this move... I guess he wanted the open diagonal} 15. Ne2 {I'm not sure what I was thinking here either} a5 {does he want to open the a-file?} 16. Bf4 {I nudge the queen} Qb7 {she stays nearby} 17. Nc3 {I think I can pick out a pawn for free...} axb4 {he trys to open the a-file} 18. Nxb5 {I take back the pawn and the a-file is only half open} O-O {he finally castles} 19. a4 {added protection for my knight and keeping the a-file closed} Ne8 {another move that puzzles me.. he must be heading for c7 to get rid of my knight on b5} 20. Bh7+ {just giving the king some grief..} Kh8 {his only move} 21. Ne5 {trying to weasel my way in} Nxe5 {he didn't like it} 22. Bxe5 {that's ok... my bishops are in his face now} Bf6 {he doesn't like that either} 23. Nd6 {but gives me a chance to mess with his queen..} Nxd6 {he wasn't fond of that either} 24. cxd6 {using the pawn kind of forces the bishop face-off} Bxe5 {he wants to trade} 25. dxe5 {I'm ok with it... it gives me two advanced pawns linked together with support available} g6 {oops! my bishop is hosed now} 26. Bxg6 {well, I'll get at least 2 pawns for him.} fxg6 {my bishop falls on his sword (or cross, whatever)} 27. Qxg6 {I have the king boxed in.. if I can just find a way to finish him off} d4 {opening the diagonal for his queen} 28. Qxh6+ {a free pawn and "check" to boot } Kg8 {if I had known how this would end, I would have perpetual checked him here (and I considered it anyway, but my rating was higher and we were even on points)} 29. Qd2 {I should have played 29. ... Qg6  30. Kh8 (forced) Qh5  31. Kg8 or Kg7 (forced) Qg4  and I could have picked off the pawn on d4} Rxa4 {he wants to trade rooks} 30. Rxa4 {I allow it... don't know if I should have, tho} Bxa4 31. Qxd4 Bc6 32. f3 Rb8 33. Qb2 Qg7 34. f4 b3 35. g3 Qg6 36. Rc1 Qe4 37. Rb1 Qh1+ 38. Kf2 Qxh2+ 39. Ke1 Qxg3+ 40. Qf2 Qxf2+ 41. Kxf2 b2 42.
