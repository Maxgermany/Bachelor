1. e4 {A popular first move.} e6 {I was trying something new - I would usually reply by pushing the pawn up to e5, but I decided to try this…} 2. d4 {He pushes up his other pawn. I like that position.} d5 {I attack his e-pawn with my d-pawn while being protected by my own e-pawn.} 3. exd5 {I would've pushed the pawn up to e5, but I'm not a great player, so I don't know what's best. He takes my pawn on d5.} exd5 {I obviously take his pawn.} 4. Nc3 {My pawn is protected by my queen, but he still opens up his knight.} Be6 {I give the pawn double protection, as I don't like getting my queen out early.} 5. Nf3 {He now has both his knights out.} Nc6 {I open up my own knight.} 6. Ng5 {I see the threat of Nxe6, but I don't really care…} Nf6 {I open up my other knight, giving the pawn TRIPLE protection.} 7. Nxe6 {He takes my bishop.} fxe6 {I obviously take his knight, but it gives me a disadvantage, as I don't like to castle in this position.} 8. Bd3 {He opens up his bishop, giving him the option to castle.} Nb4 {I threaten his bishop - quite like what he did to me, but on the other side.} 9. O-O {He castles.} Nxd3 {I take his bishop.} 10. Qxd3 {He uses his queen to take my knight.} Qd6 {I open up my queen, preparing for: Ng4 - threatening mate.} 11. Nb5 {He threats my queen, but also threats: Nc7 if I move the queen to a wrong square.} Qb6 {I move my queen out of the threat, also protecting the c7 square.} 12. Bf4 {Now he is free to move his knight to c7 again, because he is protected by the bishop on f4.} Bd6 {I protect the c7 square by using my bishop to block the path of the enemy bishop. } 13. Bxd6 {He takes my bishop with his own.} cxd6 {I take his bishop with my pawn, a position I don't like very much because it can't move anywhere.} 14. Rfe1 {He  threatens my pawn with his rook.} Ke7 {I protect the pawn with my king.} 15. a4 {He double protects his knight with his a-pawn.} a6 {I threaten his knight with my pawn, forcing him to move, but seeing this: Nc3+Qb2 (free pawn).} 16. a5 {He threatens my queen, but forgetting his knight!} Qxb5 {I take with the queen, and receive a free knight! :D} 17. Qxb5 {He takes my queen with his own.} axb5 {I obviously take his queen with my pawn.} 18. b4 {He double protects his pawn on a5.} Rac8 {I move my rook threatening his pawn on c2.} 19. a6 {He pushes his pawn up..} bxa6 {I except the swap} 20. Rxa6 {He takes the pawn…} Rxc2 {…And I take his!} 21. Ra7+ {He checks me with his rook. } Kf8 {A bad move, I realize this soon.} 22. Kf1 {I though he should have check me, winning a rook, but I didn't see my knight.} Ne4 {Not a very good move, he still has the choice of checking my king with his rook and getting my rook.} 23. Rb7 {He threatens my pawn.} Rxf2+ {I take his pawn, checking the king and being protected by the knight on e4.} 24. Kg1 {His only option.} Rd2 {I threaten his pawn.} 25. Rf1+ {He checks my king down the g-file with his rook.} Ke8 {I should of blocked with the knight, but I move my king out of the way of the castle.} 26. h3 {Now he should have checked me!!} Ng3 {I threaten his rook with my knight.} 27. Rb8+ {Finally!!! He checks my king and my only option is to move out of the way, exposing my rook to capture. :(!} Ke7 {Damn!!!} 28. Rxh8 {He takes the rook…} Nxf1 {…And I take his with my knight!} 29. Kxf1 {He takes the knight. I'm in a good position. +2 up, with nothing but  rook and pawns, but more pawns then my opponent.} Rxd4 {I take his pawn, threatening another.} 30. Rxh7 {And he takes mine.} Kf6 {I protect the pawn with my king.} 31. Rh8 {He moves his rook on to my bank rank, preparing to threaten and capture my pawns one-by-one.} Rxb4 {I take his other pawn!} 32. Rb8 {He threatens the-already-protected pawn.} d4 {I push up my pawn… The race has started!} 33. Rb6 {He threatens my pawn on d6.} d5 {I move my pawn out of the way.} 34. Ke2 {The king comes to meet the pawns…} Rb3 {…But he can't! He has been cut off by my rook!} 35. Kd2 {He moves his king in front of my pawn. My pawn can move one square but no more!} d3 {My pawn moves one square. :D} 36. Rd6 {I don't know what he's doing here.} Ke5 {I threaten his rook and move my king up to protect the pawn for when I check the king with my rook.} 37. Rd7 {He threatens my pawn with his rook…} Kd4 {…And I ignore it! Now if I move my castle to b2, the king must move to e, d, or c1, and then I will be able to push my pawn up one more square… One square from promoting!} 38. Rxg7 {He takes my pawn.} Rb2+ {I check him with my… The plan is working. :)} 39. Kd1 {He moves hi king straight back to d1.} d2 {I push my pawn up, and his king is almost entirely trapped!} 40. Rg3 {A smart move. He prevents my king from completely trapping the king, then I would just need to push my rook up to b1, and unstoppable move (checkmate).} e5 {I push my pawn up, hoping to block his rook from preventing my king from going through the third rank.} 41. h4 {He's going for a queen!} e4 {But I ignore it, for I shall beat him to it.} 42. h5 {He pushes up again, he's three squares away! He should of just moved his king to e2.} e3 {But I ignore it again, and now I'm one move away from completely trapping his king!} 43. Rxe3 {He suicides his rook - fair enough. :D} Kxe3 {Now I am +6 up, with a rook and an extra pawn.} 44. h6 {Two squares away…} Kd3 {Once again, I ignore it and trap his king, his only option is to move one of his pawns, which is then answered by R#b1. Unstoppable checkmate (white resigned). Here's what would've happened.} 45. h7 {One square away…} Rb1# {CHECKMATE!!! :D What a game! I couldn't believe I had beaten a player rated 1543! I am very proud to have won this game. I hoped you enjoyed the annotated game, thank you! :>D Nah, that nose looks bad. }
