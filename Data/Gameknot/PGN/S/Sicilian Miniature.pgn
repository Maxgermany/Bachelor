1. e4 {This is a nice quick game, where i believe the sicilian develops a bit too slowly for black} c5 2. Nf3 f6 3. d4 e6 4. Nc3 a6 5. e5 {the first non-database move attempting to open his kingside} Nc6 6. exf6 gxf6 {Nxf6 is better here, because it develops the knight and attempts to close down the kingside} 7. Bf4 Nge7 {now he has to waste an extra move developing the knight that should have gone to f6} 8. dxc5 {grabbing the pawn that the knight move freed up, again move 6 returns to haunt him} Nd5 {attacking c5 and f4} 9. Nxd5 {clearing out defenders from the kingside and winning a pawn} exd5 10. Qxd5 Nb4 {do you see the force mate? try not to look at the notation first} 11. Qh5+ {1} Ke7 12. Bd6+ {2} Ke6 13. Nd4# {bam! game over! notice how white has three active pieces and an advanced pawn while black only has an oddly positioned knight in the game}
