[Opening "Sicilian (B30), Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 {I've never quite understood the Sicilian, this second move least of all. The Knight prevents the e-pawn from advancing, as does 2...d6, but cries out to be attacked.} 3. Bb5 {So I attack it.} e6 {Preparing to put the other Knight on e7, in order to recapture with a Knight and avoid the doubled pawns. But Black doesn't have time. So why put the Knight here in the first place?} 4. Bxc6 {I see from the database White usually castles or develops the other Knight, but this is a chance to double Black's pawns, and while I know they are not always bad it can't be what Black was hoping for.} bxc6 5. O-O {Now I castle.} d5 {Black challenges the centre, his only developed piece gone.} 6. d3 {Allowing my Bishop out; I'm guessing he won't want to exchange and leave himself with pawns that are isolated as well as doubled!} Qc7 {The Black Queen seizes a handy diagonal. But it's a bit early for that, isn't it?} 7. c4 {Still on the premise that Black won't want to isolate his doubles pawns, I feel I can advance another of my own.} Bd6 {Yes, he's tucked in the Bishop for a nice attack on h2, but I'm in danger with the Knight covering it.} 8. Re1 {8.Nc3 rather invites the d-pawn's advance, and I'm not sure where to put the Bishop, so we head out of the database and I'm threatening to advance my e-pawn and cut off Black's handy diagonal.} e5 {Black doesn't want my e-pawn going any further, but stops it at the expense of a pawn...} 9. cxd5 cxd5 10. exd5 {Now I'm the one with doubled pawns! But one's a bonus pawn, so I'm not bothered.} Bg4 {A natural pin, but I expected the pawn to be attacked by the Knight first. } 11. Nc3 {Time to get my Q-side developed, and support my extra pawn.} Ne7 {He attacks it. On f6 it would invite 12.Bg5} 12. h3 {Time for the Bishop to make up its mind.} Bh5 {It retreats.} 13. g4 {And I chase it, slightly weakening my K-side, but also missing the superior 3. Nb5 Qd7 14. Nxd6+ Qxd6 15. Qa4+ and one way or another I have won the e-pawn. Bit of knee-jerk move, g4.} Bg6 {Still, the pin's gone!} 14. Nb5 {Better late than never!} Qb8 15. Nxd6+ Qxd6 16. Qa4+ Kf8 {Black wants his Queen on the board, naturally, and 16...Qd7 would have met with an exchange.} 17. Nxe5 {I grab the e-pawn.} Nxd5 {And Black gets my d-pawn.} 18. Nd7+ {However, encouraged by my having driven the King away, I drive it further away, ignoring another chess axiom - don't attack without sufficient material! 18.d4, supporting my nicely placed Knight was better. Possibly I'd imagined f6 was coming soon anyway, but had quite missed 18.d4 f6 19.dxc5.} Kg8 {At any rate, the King is satisfactorily boxed in.} 19. Ne5 {Duty done - or unable to see anything better - the Knight duly retreats from his rather wasted trip.} Nb6 {Surprisingly, Black doesn't play 19...f6 after all, instead deciding my Queen is the more dangerous piece.} 20. Qd1 {And it is, and I scurry home rather than offer the exchange on c6, which rather leaves my Knight stranded and not much else going on. Plus I'm not unaware that my d-pawn is isolated and under attack.} Rd8 {A weakness Black has spotted and naturally builds up against.} 21. h4 {A rather ponderous plan - advance my h-pawn to cut off the Black Bishop. 21.Bf4 would have been more threatening.} f6 {As it is, I have forced Black to make a move he should have made several moves back. Clever eh?} 22. Qb3+ {Instead of accepting I've run out of steam and retreating the Knight to f3, I complicate things with a check.} Qd5 {Surprisingly, Black offers an exchange. Surprising because not only is he a pawn down but because 22...Nd5 rather forces me to move my attacked Knight and 23.Nxg6 hxg6 lets out the imprisoned Rook and quite a strong attack, given my weakened pawns. In fact he'd win his pawn back, since I can't defend the foolishly advanced pawn on h4.} 23. Qxd5+ {But he didn't do any of that, and I'm happy to exchange, missing the opportunity to keep my Knight on the board with 23.Nc6} Nxd5 24. h5 {Getting rid of the Bishop allows the Rook out, as outlined earlier. A shame I didn't think of it earlier.} Be8 {The Bishop retreats.} 25. Nf3 {So does the Knight. We're headed towards that awful time: the endgame.} Nb4 {Black doubles his attack on my extra pawn, in the process letting in that chess Holy Grail...} 26. Re7 {A Rook on the 7th!!} Bd7 {Cutting off the attack on the a-pawn} 27. h6 {But I can smell blood, and another pawn. No way will Black want my Bishop on h6 by taking this pawn.} g6 {He saves the threatened g-pawn, but lets me in.} 28. Rg7+ {I can be forgiven for missing the more convoluted 28. Be3 Na6 29. g5 Bc6 30. Nd2 fxg5 31. Rxa7 Ra8 32. Rg7+} Kf8 29. Be3 {As ever, I get the order wrong, but have the general idea.} Na6 30. Nh2 {I want too much time, and am too timid in my attacking; I move the Knight to defend the g-pawn and allow the f-pawn to advance to support an advance of the g-pawn. But Black gets moves as well, and actually 30.Ng5 was perfectly playable and strong: 30...Bxg4 Nxh7+. 30...fxg5 is probably worse after 31.Bxg5} Bb5 {Black takes time to renew his attack on my weak d-pawn. Did he miss that the Bishop had been preventing my Rook from winning his a-pawn? Either 30...g5, stopping my pawn's advance, or maybe 30...Rg8, driving away my Rook are better.} 31. Rxa7 {I won't say no to the a-pawn.} g5 {Black stops the g-pawn's advance.} 32. a4 {Forcing Black's hand; he must take the weak d-pawn or lose the Knight...} Bxd3 33. Rd1 {And it's immediately pinned.} Rg8 {Black misses a chance to protect his other Rook with 33...Ke8. Perhaps he's tempting me to snap up the h-pawn and leave his Knight alone?} 34. Rxh7 {Oh, woe! I had seen 34.Rxa6. Why didn't I take it? Maybe I forgot the Bishop was pinned. More likely I felt that exchanging down still left me with a won endgame and a dangerous passed pawn on h6} Bxh7 35. Rxd8+ Kf7 36. Rxg8 Bxg8 37. f4 {Vital, to keep a passed pawn on this side of the board, as well as the potential for one on the other side...} Kg6 38. Nf3 Kxh6 39. fxg5+ fxg5 40. Nxg5 {A wicked discovered check helps too.} Kg6 41. Ne4 Bb3 42. a5 {My pawns are on safe squares; they can only be attacked by the Knight.} Bd1 43. g5 {As can this one.} Bf3 44. Nxc5 {I guess that was the logic behind this exchange, which seriously reduced my chances of winning. I forgot that I needed the Knight myself, to protect the pawns as they advanced.   But the long and complex computer analysis 44. Nd6 Bd5 45. Kf2 Nb4 46. Kg3 Nd3 47. a6 Nxb2 48. Nc8 Ba8 49. Ne7+ Kf7 50. Bxc5 Nd3 51. Bd6 Ne5 52. Nc8 Nc4 53. Kf4 Ke6 54. Bc5 Bh1 55. a7 Bb7 56. Ne7 Ne5 57. g6 Nd3+ 58. Kg4 Nxc5 and the g-pawn Queens, was way beyond me. I was just thinking - Black has no pawns; he can't win. I forgot another chess axiom, something about opposite squared Bishops?} Nxc5 45. Bxc5 {And, of course, I actually give up my K-side passed pawn, thinking that two connected passed pawns were enough.} Kxg5 46. b4 {Here they come!} Be2 47. Kf2 {Time for the King to go to their aid. But it's way too late...} Bb5 {The Bishop is there first.} 48. Ke3 Kf5 49. Kd4 Ke6 50. Bb6 {Actually, the computer still has me ahead, though I can't see that  50. Bf8 Kd7 51. Kc5 Be2 52. Bd6 Bf1 53. Bf4 Bg2 54. b5 Kc8 55. a6 Bf1 56. Kb6 Kd7 57. Bg3 Bd3 58. Be5 Kc8 would have resulted in anything more useful than the dance which ensued...} Kd6 51. Ba7 Ba6 52. Bb8+ Kc6 {Sometime around now I realised it wasn't going to be easy to shift that Bishop...} 53. Ke5 Bc4 54. Kf6 Kd7 55. Ke5 Kc6 56. Kd4 Ba6 {Well nigh impossible, in fact.} 57. Kc3 Bb5 58. Kd4 Ba6 59. Ke5 Bc4 60. Kf5 Kd7 61. Ba7 Bb5 {Surprising how long we danced without eaither offering the other the draw.} 62. Ke5 Kc6 63. Ke6 Kb7 64. Bc5 Bf1 65. Kd6 Bb5 66. Bb6 Ka6 {Until now. Even I can see, finally, I have no chance of winning this.}
