1. e4 {My favorite first move, one I almost always use.} e5 {He uses a popular response.} 2. Nf3 {I open up my knight, threatening his pawn.} d6 {He protects with his pawn, a move that I wouldn't do, I would usually respond by Nc6 or Bd6.} 3. Nc3 {I open up my other knight protecting my pawn from any possible threats.} Nf6 {He opens up his knight.} 4. Be2 {I am now in a position to castle.} b6 {He pushes his pawn up one square.} 5. d4 {I threaten his pawn, he now has a choice, protect the e5 pawn with one of his pieces or take my pawn…} exd4 {He takes my pawn.} 6. Nxd4 {And I take his.} Bb7 {He threatens my pawn on e4, I can protect my pawn using my other pawn on f2, my bishop, or my queen, but I don't like using my queen to early unless I see a good opportunity.} 7. Bb5+ {I check with my bishop, he now can't take my pawn due to the threat and he must block the check.} Nbd7 {He blocks with his knight - probably the best move.} 8.

Bxa6 {… I do. :)} Bxa6 {And he takes me back. :(} 17. Nc6 {I threaten his queen with my own queen and my knight, seeing: 17. Qxd1 Ne7! 18. Kh8 Qxd1!} Qxd1 {Just as planned…} 18. Nxe7+ {I capture his bishop… FOR FREE! and check his king, forcing him to move, which then allows me to capture his queen! :D} Kh8 {The only possible move.} 19.

I won with a bit of luck but it was a tight game in the end.}
