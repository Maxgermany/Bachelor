1. e4 {my standard opening} e5 {and he matches it} 2. Qh5 {set up the opening play for an early check} d6 {which he defuses} 3. Bc4 {continuing play} g6 {his counter} 4. Qf3 {and one last stab at it} Nf6 {so now the game can begin in earnest} 5. d3 {defends the bishop at c4 and frees up the c1 bishop as well} Be6 {he offers a bishop trade} 6. Bxe6 {which i accept} fxe6 {and he completes the trade} 7. Bg5 {trapping his knight there and setting up a potential queen/rook fork in the next move} Bg7 {but he wisely defends the knight} 8. Nc3 {making my knight active and freeing up a castling possibility} Rf8 {he further shores up the knight and presents the possibility of attacking my queen soon} 9. Qh3 {so i attack the e6 pawn for a possible check} Qe7 {and he defends e6} 10. Nge2 {freeing up another castling route and bringing the other knight into play} Qf7 {getting the powerful queen and rook on one file, setting up a future attack on f2} 11. O-O {but that attack is defused of threat by the castling} Nh5 {he moves the knight out anyway, lots of possibilities for a move to f4} 12. d4 {attacking e5, hoping to bring my e2 knight into play if he takes the pawn} h6 {which he doesn't, forcing me to address the attack on my bishop first} 13. Bd2 {fleeing, obviously} Nc6 {a triple move: he brings his knight into play, attacks the weak d4, and frees up the back row for castling} 14. d5 {i decide to change plans and fork the knight and pawn} exd5 {he takes the pawn} 15. exd5 {and i complete the parry to put the knight back in danger} Nb4 {he flees and sets up an attack on c2} 16. Nb5 {attack the knight and force him to make his attack now if he wants it, and set up my own future attack if he moves his queen off row 7} Nxc2 {he makes the expected attack} 17. Rac1 {and i attack with the bishop} Nd4 {smart move, sets up a knight trade from either of my knights, and a king/rook fork check if i don't take it} 18. Rxc7 {but i decide to ignore his knight's threat for now and force him to address his queen} Nxe2+ {which he delays by putting me in check and stealing a knight with no possibility of trade - i neglected that possibility, stupidly} 19. Kh1 {only possibility} Qf5 {offers a queen trade} 20. Nxd6+ {but he made a big blunder and missed that great opening} Kd8 {he insures that he'll at least get a rook out of this deal} 21. Nxf5 {but i get his queen} Kxc7 {takes the rook} 22. Nxg7 {and i decide to trade my knight for his second bishop} Nxg7 {he completes the trade} 23. Qxh6 {and i grab a pawn and attack the knight, knowing i'll probably at least get another pawn out of this} Nf5 {he flees and attacks simultaneously} 24. Qxg6 {and i grab the other pawn} Ne7 {he attacks again} 25. d6+ {but he missed another crucial opening, and his knight is doomed} Kd7 {he makes sure he'll at least grab my pawn and eliminate the promotion risk} 26. dxe7 {but i grab his knight and take the threat off my queen} Kxe7 {he finishes off the pawn} 27. Bb4+ {and a check that should net me a bishop for rook trade if i want it} Kd7 {he dodges} 28. Rd1+ {and i check again} Nd4 {he blocks the check} 29. Qd6+ {and i get another one} Kc8 {he dodges} 30. Qd7+ {and i make my huge blunder because my conditional moves got messed up -- i planned to take f8, then grab a8 when he fled from check, and the game would have been all but over here} Kxd7 {but instead he grabs my foolishly offered queen} 31. Bxf8 {and i follow through on the long hovering bishop for rook trade} Rxf8 {he completes the trade} 32. f3 {and i remove his threat to f2} Kd6 {he fortifies the weak pawn at e5} 33. Rd3 {and i'm setting up several avenues for attack and movement} Rc8 {he threatens an easy checkmate} 34. g4 {and i eliminate that possibility} Rc1+ {he checks me anyway, to get me up to the second row} 35. Kg2 {and i'm forced to run} Rc2+ {so that he can put me in check again and start going after the second row pawns} 36. Kg3 {i run} Rxb2 {and he takes pawn number 1} 37. f4 {time to free up the middle of the board b/c i'm planning an end run for promotion to redeem this disaster} exf4+ {he takes the offer} 38. Kxf4 {and i take his pawn back} Kc5 {he protects that now weak knight} 39. h4 {and i start edging those pawns up} Ne2+ {a check} 40. Kf5 {but it doesn't matter much} Rxa2 {he takes that other unprotected pawn} 41. h5 {and i continue the drive for the end game} Ra6 {logically he doesn't want to make it too easy} 42. g5 {and i shore up the eventual move to h6} Kc4 {so he attacks the rook} 43. Rd7 {and i move him out of the way while keeping his king locked off from my advancing pawns and potentially attacking b7} Ng3+ {he's got check and a fork on h5} 44. Kg4 {so i protect the pawn} Ne4 {and now he attacks g5} 45. h6 {so i move the now protected pawn up to row 6} Nf2+ {and he goes for check again, jockeying around in hopes i'll make a mistake} 46. Kf5 {moving back up} Ra5+ {and check again} 47. Kg6 {but that just allows me to move up with my pawns} Ra6+ {so check again} 48. Kf7 {and i move further up, anticipating having to protect the pawns some more} Ng4 {he's now prepared to sacrifice a knight to get both those pawns} 49. h7 {but i won't oblige, leaving me a move away from taking back control} Ne5+ {he forks my king and rook} 50. Ke7 {but even if he takes the rook he doesn't have much chance} Ng6+ {check again, and he attacks h8 to prevent promotion} 51. Kf7 {and i give him back the same fork while attacking his knight} Ne5+ {he takes the fork again} 52. Ke8 {and i give him a different move so we can't keep this game up} Re6+ {attacks with the rook} 53. Re7 {and i offer a trade that would still leave me with an impending promotion} Rc6 {he declines and sets up a rook to c8 mate} 54. Rxe5 {but he apparently forgot about the unprotected knight} Rc7 {attacks the pawn, knowing that if i simply promote it, he can put me in check and eliminate the queen right away} 55. g6 {so i just protect the pawn for now} b5 {he starts his own promotion drive} 56. Kd8 {but i won't let him keep me locked up} Rb7 {he keeps the possibility alive} 57. Kc8 {and i attack again. no chance now, he's done} Rg7 {i guess he plans to at least get rid of one pawn} 58. h8=Q {but that's fine, i have a queen now} Rxg6 {he takes the pawn as planned} 59. Qh4+ {and i get check} Kd3 {he flees} 60. Qe4+ {and there you go, forked check where he'd lose his last rook, and he resigns.   hopefully that was interesting, i wanted to annotate a game with plenty of maneuvers, and in this case he fought hard and i had to come back from a collosal blunder to win anyway.}
