[Opening "Robatsch defence (A41), Rossolimo variation"]

1. e4 {Hello! Will try to annotate a fun and interesting game I played recently against -mark-. I sacrificed a whole Rook (maybe incorrect) but get excellent mating opportunities instead!} g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 {We plays the Robatsch defence, the Rossolimo variation. } d6 4. Be2 Nf6 5. Nc3 O-O 6. O-O {Now have we both castled kingside and so far followed the theory. } c6 7. h3 b5 {Somewhat aggressive move? This pawn probably want to advance to b4 and chase my Knight away! An option for me is now a3 to prevent this, but I played Bd3 instead!} 8. Bd3 Bb7 {First now we begin to leave the opening theory and must start to think on our own!} 9. a3 a6 10. Be3 Nbd7 11. e5 {Pushing my e-pawn forward! Will try to open up in the center! Rather complicated!} dxe5 12. dxe5 Nd5 13. Nxd5 cxd5 14. Bd4 {Maybe this move by me seems a little bit odd out? But I want to protect my e-pawn better and my dark-squared Bishop also aims towards the Black King!} e6 15. c3 Qc7 16. Re1 Nc5 17. Qe2 Nxd3 18. Qxd3 Qd7 19. Rad1 Rac8 20. b4 Rc4 {This move seems a little bit awkward out for me? This Rook could play a more active role on other squares!} 21. Qd2 Rfc8 22. Rdc1 Qe7 23. Qd3 Rc4c6 {Retreat! Black doesn´t have to been afraid of c 4. If I do that move here, I will simply lose that pawn!} 24. Bc5 {Threatening the Black Queen. If I was Black, I would try to exchange dark-squared  Bishops here. That action will also make White`s c-pawn significantly weaker!} Qd8 25. Qd4 {I´m starting to gain a small space advantage here!} Ba8 26. Qg4 {The White Queen is aiming against the Black King!} a5 27. Bd4 axb4 28. axb4 Bb7 29. h4 h6 30. Re3 {A rook lift. Common in positions like this!} Kh7 31. g3 Rc6c4 32. Rce1 {Placing my pieces better before the breakthrough!} Ba8 33. Kg2 Qc7 34. Rh1 Bf8 35. Ng5+ {Interesting sacrifice, I have tried to analyze what would happen if Black accept it and it would probably lead to checkmate in some moves! But, because I´m not a very good analyzer I can maybe missed something? But at least I had won the piece back!} Kg7 {Black chosed to deny my sacrifice. As I just mentioned it would be better for Black to take the piece, probably winning, because my sacrifice was incorrect.} 36. Nf3 Be7 37. h5 {White tries to open up lines for the Queen and Rook!} g5 38. Nd2 Rc6 39. f4 Ra6 40. fxg5 Bxg5 41. Nf3 {I develop all my pieces towards the Kingside, maybe the right continuation?} Ra2+ {An interference check by Black!} 42. Kh3 Qe7 43. Rf1 Kh8 44. Nxg5 hxg5 45. Rf6 {A pretty good move, I think?} Rg8 46. Ref3 Rg7 47. h6 {Advancing with my h-pawn!} Rh7 48. Qxg5 {A pawn for free! But how is it best to continue after this?} Bc6 49. Rf3f4 Ra8 50. Qh5 {Tripling pieces against Blacks f-pawn.} Rg8 {Can´t take at f7 for tactical reasons!} 51. g4 Be8 {Now is it necessary for Black to protect his f-pawn. But Black`s position begins to look very cramped!} 52. g5 {Advancing with my g-pawn, but it is complicated and not easy to find a winning move for me! For example, g6 is not a winning continuation!} Qd7 53. Qg4 Qd8 54. Rf4f3 Qd7 55. Rf3f1 Qd8 56. Ra1 {A new idea! White takes control over the a-file with one of his Rooks and is planning to occupy the a7-square with the Rook!} Qb8 57. Rxe6 {A Rook sacrifice that seems a little bit strange for me, when I look back at this game.} fxe6 58. Qf4 Qd8 59. Qf6+ {Pretty good move I believe? Forces Black to exchange Queens and gives White three advanced free pawns and also some very serious threats against Black`s King!} Qxf6 {Forced move!} 60. exf6 Bf7 {Blocks White`s discovered check in the following move. Probably the best move in this position?} 61. Kh4 Rc8 62. Kg4 Kg8 63. Ra5 {Threatens the weak Black b-pawn. Aiming to enforce Black to weaken his position because of the need to protect weak pawns!} Be8 64. Ra6 {White threats another pawn, wants to weaken Blacks position so much as possible!} Bd7 65. Kh5 {Now can White´s King sneak in to the h5-square!} Be8+ {Too late!} 66. g6 Rhc7 {Rather bad move by black, what was the purpose to double his Rooks on the c-file in this crucial situation of the game?} 67. Kg5 {Unpinning the g-pawn!} Bd7 {The last mistake by Black!} 68. h7+ {Black gave up, because if...Kf8 then h8Q# and if ...Kh8 then a discovered check with the move f7 and the only answer to that is ...e5, but then Bxe5#!}
