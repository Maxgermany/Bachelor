1. e4 {An interesting OTB game played between myself and a co-worker who is also on gameknot. e4!} c6 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 b5 4. e5 {Being the game is OTB this move was more for irritational purposes and hopes of gaining full control of the centre.} Nd5 5. Nxd5 cxd5 6. d4 a6 7. Bd3 e6 8. O-O {At this point I have managed to get a decent bit of arsenal aiming towards the kingside.} d6 9. Ng5 {I decide to proceed with plan A, shock and awe on the king side...} f6 {B-b7 was probably better, this leaves the king exposed to the queen.} 10. Nxh7 dxe5 11. Qh5+ {And my will be done.  He can't go g6 because I will just take the pawn.  He's forced to move his king.} Ke7 12. dxe5 {So I take a pawn and in my head am praying for pxp...} Nd7 13. Bg5 {I think this wasn't my best choice in sacking my clergyman.  But Ian knows when I sac pieces that I must be up to something devious, so he doesn't oblige. } Nxe5 14. Qh4 fxg5 15. Qxg5+ Kd7 16. Nxf8+ Qxf8 17. Qxe5 Qd6 {He is set for a mate on Qxh2#.  only one problem....} 18. Qxg7+ {When I moved my queen he was excited!  He moved his queen to h2 with blistering speed and proclaimed CHECKMATE!  However, he was quickly upset once I told him that he wasn't allowed to make that move because he's in check.  LOL} Qe7 19. Qxh8 {Plan for mate on h2, foiled...and lost a rook.} Bb7 20. Qe5 Rg8 21. Rad1 Qh4 22. Rfe1 Qh3 {A nice little sidewinding assault by Ian.  It must be dealt with promptly. } 23. Be4 {I knew there was a good reason for moving my R to d1. :)} Ke7 24. Bxd5 Rxg2+ {This move was KIBITZED over ian's shoulder, and we both about gave up on the game, but I saw something and figured we'd give it a try.  The move itself is a good move OTB for sure. White  BxR and black QxB#.  Black wins.  And alternatively if white K-f1 and I lose my queen with R-g5 w/ discovered +} 25. Kh1 {Only decent move I had.  Queen guards h2.} Bxd5 {I must take the bishop, otherwise another disovered check and I lose my queen. } 26. Rxd5 Rxf2 27. Qc7+ Kf6 28. Qd8+ Kg6 29. Qg5+ Kf7 30. Qh5+ {He keeps behind his pawn well, so I said forget it, I'll just trade Q's and still be a R up. } Qxh5 31. Rxh5 Rxc2 32. Rf1+ Ke7 33. h4 Rxb2 {I did some calculating and realized that I could get my pawn up on H file before he could get his down....but my calc's were a bit off. } 34. Rg5 Rxa2 35. h5 Ra4 36. Kg2 b4 37. h6 b3 38. h7 Rh4 39. Rh1 b2 40. Rb1 Rxh7 41. Rxb2 {Not exactly what I had hoped} Kf6 42. Ra5 Ra7 43. Rba2 e5 44. Ra5xa6+ {He resigns here. We didn't really have time for me to be chasing his king around the board...being at work and all. :)  But it was a good game otherwise, a couple different interesting situations. }
