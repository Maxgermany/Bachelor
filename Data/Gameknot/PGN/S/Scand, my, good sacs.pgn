[Opening "Scandinavian defence, Lasker variation (B01)"]

1. e4 {To attack can be very dangerous... for the one who attacks. In a "thematic" Scandinavian, Lasker variation.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Be2 c6 5. d4 Qc7 {Here, the "winning" move for white is d5. It puts me under a real pressure, since black cannot allow white to go to b5 with one of its minor pieces. The only time I faced an opponent who went for it, I was crushed in a dozen games. Black doesn't have to take fxe5, and if white takes dxc6, black has to play, very oddly, bxc6, otherwise Nb5, and related moves are overwhelming. Maybe this is not completely accurate, or oversimplified, I admit. } 6. Nf3 Bf5 {I always say that the best move here for white is e5... but nobody makes it :-)} 7. O-O e6 {Saved from the e5 danger. } 8. Re1 Nd7 {I am aware of the danger represented by the half-open e file, and the possible sacs in d5 white has.} 9. Nh4 {The knight goes for the bishop. Very well, I lose a good bishop for a poor knight. But I have counterplay for that, even if I have to lose a tempo for it. } Bg6 10. Nxg6 hxg6 {Now white's pressure is balanced by my pressure against h2, and even if it is easy for white to defend, he must start to figure out a plan, while I am ready to castle queenside. The attack coming from a4, b4, etc. is something my experience says that I can cope with. } 11. g3 {The other defence, h3, is definitely better. It is not clear if it "destroys" my setting, but it is better for sure. Because the three pawns can be taken, even by pieces. A sacrifice is coming. } O-O-O {This way, I risk. But in one move, I put my rook in front of his queen, that cannot get out easily. My knight is free to jump to e5 or c5. I know white will attack my queenside, but in the meanwhile, I will do the same on his kingside. With 11. h3, I better think in how to defend, and normally I can (I have a good knight jump due to the pin of the d4 pawn in front of the white queen. It always worries white...). } 12. Be3 {Building the attack. Better seems Bf4, but I just had to choose between Bd6 or even e5 to defend. } Ngf6 {Still developing. The black position seems to be very innocent, due to underdevelopment. } 13. Qb1 {First "strange" move. But it makes sense: releases the pin on the queen, and adds pressure to the a and b pawns, that soon will be launched against my king. } Nh5 {Now, I am building up MY attack. And I am offering the knight for the white bishop, if he accepts it, it will release some strenght to the white force over my king... while my rook still aims at h2, and soon it will be ready to be supported by the other one. } 14. a4 {Here he goes. I have one or two moves before I have really to take care of the queenside. } f5 {This is a very dangerous move. I always try to avoid it on this scheme, because the weakness of e6 is often mortal. But, in this case, all my attack can vanishes after Ne4, so I have to avoid that. Yes, I know, the e column is easy to open for white. So will become the d column for me. } 15. Bg5 {It makes me lose a tempo defending the rook while he is starting to open the e column... and leaving the d column to me. Moreover, it "helps" me to get my piece over the kingside. No matter the knight is pinned, as you will see. } Ndf6 {Now, I could have been almost "destroyed" by 16. Bc4, double-attacking e6.  Anyway, there are some compensations here:  I can take the d pawn with my rook.  After the check, I can simply retire my king to b8. It IS in danger, but my attack is going on.  After the lsb moves, I can jump with my knight to g4, adding material to my attack.} 16. Rd1 {Releases the pressure on the e column, maybe realizing what I commented before. But my aim is not to take the d pawn...} Bd6 {The gun is armed. } 17. b4 {Back to the original a-b plan... less dangerous, now, without the dsb aiming at a7 (I will question this move). Anyway, if Bc4, there is no problem for me. Not anymore. } Bxg3 {I could swear he didn't expect this one. } 18. fxg3 Nxg3 {And this. I am sacrificing TWO minor pieces, but this is only apparent. After Qg3  I can take the bishop in g5, so...} 19. Bxf6 {Ok, but not enough. From now on, most variants go to mate, the better for white with a piece less and a very bad position. } Nxe2+ 20. Nxe2 Qxh2+ 21. Kf1 Qh1+ 22. Kf2 Rh2+ 23. Ke3 Qe4+ 24. Kd2 gxf6 {I could well have taken Rxe2, but I wanted to threaten Rxd4.} 25. Kc1 Qe3+ 26. Kb2 Rxe2 27. Ra3 Qf2 28. Rad3 Re4 29. Rf1 Qh2 30. Rh1 Qd6 31. c3 Re2+ 32. Ka1 e5 33. Rhd1 e4 34. Rd3d2 Rxd2 35. Rxd2 e3 36. Re2 Qg3 37. Qf1 Rh8 38. Qc1 f4 39. c4 Qf3 40. Re1 Rh2 41. Rf1 Qg2 42. Qb1 e2 43. Rg1 Qf2 44. d5 Qd4+ {}
