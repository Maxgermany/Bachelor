1. e4 {My normal opening as white} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {The way I used to set up the Scottish game. Preparing for d4.} a6 {I had never experienced this move. I was used to Nf6. So i decided to wait for Nf6 before pushing d4......} 4. a3 d6 5. h3 {Paranoid} Nf6 6. d4 exd4 7. Nxd4 Nxd4 8. Qxd4 c5 {A favorite move by beginners, threatening the queen with that pawn.} 9. Qa4+ Bd7 10. Qb3 b6 {Not a very good move, b5 would have solved the pains about to come.} 11. Bc4 Qe7 {Only way to protect his pawn} 12. Bg5 {Putting on more pressure} b5 {Smart move. Preparing to separate my bishop and queen, relieving all the stress on the F pawn. I did not realize the bad position my queen was in.} 13. Bd5 c4 {I was almost tempted into Qb4. But it didn't take me too long to realize that would be horrible trap when they push pawn a5.} 14. Qa2 Ra7 {At least I stopped any attempt of castling queen-side!} 15. O-O {My coach used to joke all the time about how I would never castle in a game. Well this proves castling is a powerful move.} h6 16. Bh4 {Hoping to draw g5. I rarely do this, normally I just take the knight and break the pin but this time I'm content with letting him destroy his own king protection} g5 {And he does it} 17. Bg3 Bg7 {A very daring plan forms in my head at this point. I study the board for maybe ten minutes and then I make the move I already knew I was going to do.} 18. Bxd6 {My opponent is starting to become confused though it doesn't take him long to make his move} Qxd6 19. e5 {Brilliant! If he takes the pawn Re1 and his queen gets pinned in front of his king. This would have ended the game. I had to leave the room at this point. My whole body was shaking and I was starting to feel feverish. I paced the hall and took many sips of water as I waited for my opponents move.} Qc5 {He didn't fall for it. The move confused him greatly but after maybe ten minutes of hard thinking he saw the danger.} 20. exf6 {Getting my points back....} Bxf6 {I thought quite a while to decide what to do. I just knew that I needed to act quickly if I wanted to prevent a king-side castle.} 21. Ne4 {An obvious move but definitely not to his liking. My opponent wasn't liking all these moves that looked like I was giving away free pieces. Only two moves for him really, he took the better one I believe.} Qd4 22. Nd6+ {Check! No castle for you!} Ke7 23. Nxf7 {Moving the rook would have been dangerous. Rf8, Re1+ then he has to block and loses a bishop.} Qxd5 {But he sees he must trade.} 24. Nxh8 Bxh8 {Funny enough, after all of this complicated and clever trading on my part, it is still a tie game points wise. The only problem is that I've succeeded in stripping away all of the kings protection.} 25. Rad1 Qc6 26. Rfe1+ Kd8 27. b3 {Preparing to free my trapped queen} Bc3 {I don't understand this move.....} 28. Re3 cxb3 29. Qxb3 {Choosing to develop my queen as soon as possible instead of keeping my pawns together.} Bf6 30. Qg8+ Kc7 {Moving his king to the meager protection available} 31. Qh7 {By this move my opponent had given up. He started shaking his head and from here it was all downhill for him. I was finding all the perfect moves and trades the whole game, and I could tell it frustrated him.} Kb6 {Moving the black bishop instead might have protected the pawn. Instead he chooses to break the pin by moving his king.} 32. Qxh6 {Claiming my free piece. Finally I am leading the game.} Bc8 33. Rf3 Rd7 {??? He offers me a rook trade? I could not resist, that gives me the bishop and clears more pieces of the board} 34. Rxd7 Qxd7 35. Rxf6+ Kb7 {Bad move. That just gives me the free pawn and makes the checkmate easier} 36. Rxa6 Qd1+ {A feeble check} 37. Kh2 Qd4 {I don't know what he was thinking here. I don't actually think he was anymore. Inevitable checkmate from here, he just didn't see it.} 38. Qc6+ Kb8 39. Ra8# {This game is definitely my favorite over the board game I have ever played. I did it so long ago the time control may be slightly inaccurate. It was one of my first successful games. I feet especially proud of it because it was mostly won by my skillful moves, and not the opponents stupid mistakes.}
