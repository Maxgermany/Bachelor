1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 {Celle accepts the gambit Pawn.} 5. c3 Be7 6. d4 d6 {Avoiding PxP, which would completely concede the center.} 7. dxe5 Nxe5 8. Nxe5 dxe5 {So far, Celle has played well. He has not let Fischer seize a positional advantage or fallen too far behind in development.} 9. Qh5 g6 10. Qxe5 Nf6 {Preparing to castle.} 11. Ba3 {One of the thematic moves of the Evans. Now Celle cannot castle without losing a piece.} Rf8 {Unpinning the Knight.} 12. O-O Ng4 13. Qg3 {Celle decides to trade Bishops, trying to cut down the wood and ease his defesive task.} Bxa3 14. Nxa3 Qe7 15. Bb5+ {Fischer tries to generate an attack on Celle's King, which is stuck in the center of the board.} c6 16. Nc4 {Celle has a chance to simplify the position with 16... PxB 17 N-Q6 ch K-Q1 [not 17... QxN??? 18 QxQ] 18 NxB KxN 19 QxN ch K-B2, but elects instead to augment the guard on his advanced Knight.} Qe6 17. Rad1 cxb5 {Now that Fischer controls the open file with his QR, he can afford to sacrifice this Knight to pressure Celle's King.} 18. Qc7 Bd7 19. Nd6+ Ke7 20. Nf5+ {Another sacrifice. But when mate is in the offing...} gxf5 21. exf5 Rac8 {Trying to break the force of Fischer's attack.} 22. Rxd7+ Qxd7 23. f6+ Nxf6 {Celle is completely tied up. His material advantage is useless to him.} 24. Re1+ Ne4 25. Rxe4+ {Fischer closes in for the kill.} Kf6 26. Qxd7 Rfd8 27. Qg4 {Celle resigns. He has fought off the mate, but his material and positional disadvantages render his position hopeless. Well done by Fischer! [He had a mate in 5 with 27 R-B4 ch K-K4 28 R-B5 ch K-K5 29 P-B3 ch K-K6 30 R-K5 ch K-B5 31 Q-B5 mate, but as this was a timed simul, he decided to play a move that would end the game immediately with a resignation.]}
