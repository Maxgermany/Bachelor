1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 c6 3. c3 f5 {Strange move order. A Dutch player probably won't play c6 so early, but it's ok. } 4. Nf3 e6 {A Stonewall...} 5. e3 Nf6 6. h3 Nbd7 7. Nbd2 Qb6 8. Qc2 {Or Qb3, inviting the exchange. Boring game. } Ne4 9. Be2 {Desperately looking for "something" to warm up the game. I think in sac f2. } Be7 10. h4 Ndf6 11. Ne5 O-O 12. Ndf3 {I just don't want to castle kinside. That will kill the game. } Ng4 {...but in hangering here and there, I got myself in serious trouble. } 13. Bg3 {?? NxB, fxN, Nxe3 -/+} Qd8 {? Misses the chance, or just want to delay it. } 14. O-O-O {I'll sac the exchange and a pawn in order to get some activity.} Nxg3 {Black chooses this way to cash in the exchange. } 15. fxg3 Nxe3 16. Qd2 Nxd1 17. Kxd1 {I needed my Q on dark squares, to support g5.} c5 {Black seizes his chance correctly. But defence will be silly and boring. I prefer to risk...  } 18. Ng5 {Hitting f7. } Qb6 {?Black should have exchanged, but that meant to open the h column... as I supposed, he thought it twice. } 19. Bh5 {Not exactly knowing what to do, I try to provoke some weakness. } cxd4 {Black doesn't take the bait. Very good. } 20. Bf7+ {Again, I didn't intend to defend. I have to attack to the death. I am pressing on e6, now. } Kh8 21. Re1 {I sensed this rook would have been fine, here, x-ray pressing e6. Even at the cost of...} dxc3 22. Qxc3 {...and nothing happens. Now, a diagonal threat to open if g6. But...} d4 {:-( obvious. } 23. Qc4 {Pressing e6. I'll tie black up. I'm -4, now!} Qxb2 {Maximum tension: the question is if black has something after Qb1+, or not. Ke2 (or Bb4+), d3+, Kf1, d2. But white has its own threats, too, and they will materialize very soon, and DON'T have a free tempo to the mate. } 24. Bxe6 {f7 is free for my knight. And the famous pattern becomes now possible. } Bxe6 25. Qxe6 {Black has the move and the check... will ever he escape?} Bxg5 {Interesting, but late. } 26. hxg5 {Simply this. The threat is the same. } Rac8 {?? This makes the following sequence a piece of cake for white, but black though he was winning!} 27. Nf7+ {Before, RxN and it would have been all. But now, such a move will be mate. } Kg8 28. Nh6+ Kh8 29. Qg8+ {It's always a pleasure when you can play this OTB...}
