[Opening "Caro-Kann defence (B15)"]

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Karo-Kann defence. I'm not deeply familiar with it, but I like to play diverse moves any time. So Nc3 isn't my most common answer, but I count on basic strategy knowledge. } a6 {The previous comment was so that I note why here I couldn't find much sense in the a6 move. So I didn't knew what to play. } 4. Bf4 {I decided just to develop. Nf3 didn't seem the best cause it lets the black bishop to go on g4. So Bf4 seemed better. } g6 {That surprised me and scared me at the same time. It's surprising because for the first four moves black only plays with his pawns. So I'm much further in development. However, I thought that by attacking on d4, black would make me play e5 at some time. That would leave the f5 square for him. } 5. h4 {I'm prety sure this is not a theory, but I still find the h4 move really precise. It's idea is playing early h5. It wouldbe badfor black's pawn structure, cause after me taking on g6 he would most certainly have to take with the f pawn. So the kingside would be easier to be attacked later. Usually there is a knight on f6, who prevents the h5 move. But now if black plays 5... Nf6 I'll play 6. e5 on the spot and still be able to play h5 in a while. } h5 {So that's the solution my opponent found. Of course I've seen it. I knew that later I would better attack h5 with g4. Now that isn't possible cause the c8 bishop keeps the g4 square. So my immediate plan is to block that c8 bishop. } 6. exd5 cxd5 7. Qf3 {Demanding the d5 pawn to be defended. If 7... Nf6 8. Be5 Bg7 9. Bxf6 Bxf6 10. Nxd5 Bxd4 and now I can take the d-line with castle wueenside or something, so I decided that such position is better for me.  The move that I didn't see, but now seems good for me is 7.... Be6 } e6 {The the bishop is blocked. Now I can play g4 but I also noticed that the black squares of my opponent are weak. } 8. Be5 {So I decided to interfere his development first. } Rh7 {If black had played 8... f6 (pawn again :D) I would've answered 9. Bxb8 Rxb8 10. Qg3 winning a pawn } 9. Nh3 {Seemed like would do some problems for the black, but I didn't see the following ... } Be7 {Here I could just g3 that would slow my g4 plan too much. In other position like that I remember playng 10. Bxb8 Rxb8 11. Qg3 followed by f4. } 10. Ng5 {Here I decided to sacrifice a pawn and count on good development and more equiped king-side. } Bxg5 11. hxg5 Qxg5 12. Bd3 {Notice that if black now plays f6 I would capture his queen by answering Bf4. } Nc6 {Didn't want to exchange and lose my control on the black squares. } 13. Bf4 Qe7 {So now I had to defend my d4 pawn. I decided that Qe3 is the best, cause it prevents e5 and Nh6 at the same time. } 14. Qe3 b5 {If black had developed more, they could've get much better chances. I expected 14... Nf6 15. f3 Bd7 and me able to play g4 at some time. Now it happens even faster. } 15. g4 h4 {I could recapture the pawn by playing Bg5. However, I noticed that by playing g5 I slow black's development and at the same time make the h4 pawn hard to defend ( so that I most surely take it later). } 16. g5 Qb4 {A little problem for me. It looked like I'll have to let another pawn go. } 17. O-O-O {I have to admit that after Qxd4 my position is not the best. I guees I would've played 18. Qxd4 Nxd4 19. Rhe1 attacking on d5 and keeping the Bxg6 treat open. } Nge7 {Against that eventual Bxg6 treat for recapturing pawn. So now I have to defend d4. } 18. Ne2 Qa5 {That move was in a way needed cause I was treatening to play Bc7 and then attack his queen with my pawns, which would've lead to some problems for him. Qa5 also attacks my a2 pawn. I refused to return my knight on c3, cause I had just moved it. } 19. a3 b4 {Oops... Seems like I'm having a hard time here. But in fact the weak black squares let me save the position. } 20. Bd6 {Now if he takes on a3, I'll take with my bishop and it will be even stronger. } Bb7 {Finaly he ends his development. Moves ahead I might start tinking about recapturing the h4 pawn and doing a nice king-side attack. The key moment here is that my pieces would more easily go to kingside and blacks bishop couldn't join the defence cause of the pawn structure. } 21. Qf4 Rc8 {In my opinion, a big blunder. O-O-O would've let black have a much better position. } 22. Rxh4 Rxh4 23. Qxh4 {The H file is mine. } Kd7 24. Bxe7 Nxe7 {If 24... Kxe7 25. Qf4 with a nice attack. } 25. Qh7 {Trying to fix the position there. } bxa3 {I have to stop that pawn and there is only one way without losing one more of mine. } 26. b3 a2 27. Kb2 {Now the pawn couldn't be promoted and there is nothing else to be done on the queen side. Black has to defend himself. } Rf8 28. Qg7 Ke8 {Qd8 and letting the pawn would have been better. It may lead to draw, but not now. The black King and rook are fixed and I have to manage to join other piece in the attack. One possibility was my rook moving as it followss to a1-a2-a1-h1-h8. It's long. There is another also that long plan. Moving my knight as it follows on g1-f3-h2-g4-f6. I decided thats stronger cause queen on d8 might help against rook on h8, but not that much against knight on f6. } 29. Ng1 Nc6 30. Nf3 Nb4 {That was weak. I guess my opponent hadn't seen the folowing sacrifice. } 31. Bxg6 {In fack I may be losing if I don't play that. } fxg6 32. Ne5 {treating mate on d7. } Bc8 {Qd8 was still a possibility but then I at least take the bishop on b7. } 33. Nxg6 {My opponent surrendered. I guess he saw that After Rf7 I would take his rook and then manage to exchange the queens. }
