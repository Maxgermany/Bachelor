1. c4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. g3 f5 {Al loves the Dutch, though technically this game never quite becomes one because White plays his d-pawn to the 3rd rank instead of the 4th. Had Al played 1. ...f5, I would have pounced on him with 2. g4!?, the Krejcik Gambit with which I've trounced him several times from within the context of an English pawn formation. Old dogs can, apprently, learn new tricks: Al's more circumspect here, waiting until I've committed both my KN and g-pawn in a way that makes the gambit impossible to play. ...Sneaky booger!} 4. d3 Nf6 5. Bg2 Be7 6. O-O O-O 7. Nc3 Nc6 8. Ne1 {This move is virtually thematic with me, from this and any closely resembling "White Dragon" pawn formation. The Knight is off to c2 where it helps support the center and a Q-side pawn expansion. The move also uncovers the long diagonal for White's King's Bishop, another de rigueur theme for White in the fianchettoed English.} Qe8 {With the text Black pursues a strategy almost exclusive to the Dutch. And now if 9. Nb5 Bd8 followed by a push to c6 and Bc7, with an almost ideal defensive shell for the middlegame - in other words, exactly the sort of closed game Al prefers. So I didn't even consider 9. Nb5. ----- In some ways, as I remarked to Al during the game (we were talking on the phone while playing), our strategies became for a while a case of "I'll ignore you if you ignore me," as, as if by unspoken agreement, we each pursued the opening pretty much unmolested by the other.} 9. Nc2 Qh5 10. b4 {Black's last move is no threat at all unless White panics.} Ng4 11. h3 Nh6 12. e3 {! Black wants to play ...f4, bringing the QB to bear against White's K-side. This response to that threat puts the question to Black's rather hasty aggression immediately, while simultaneously setting up White's own pawn-push to f4, stoppering up the attack on White's K-side which frees the first player to probe for weaknesses on Black's Q-side.} Qxd1 13. Rxd1 g5 14. Nd5 Bd8 15. Bb2 Nf7 {Black sets up for a pawnstorm, preparing a push to h5.} 16. a4 {But White's pawns come first.} Be6 17. a5 a6 18. Kh2 {The prophylactic pause that refreshes! White dithers constructively, getting his King out of any future line of back-rank fire, while waiting for Black to commit himself to something.} Rb8 19. Bc3 {Double-protecting the a-pawn before playing the break. Black's pieces have very little useful to do: White has a meaningful space advantage, while Black's K-side pawnstorm is mostly for show without his Queen to help facilitate it. It's a funny position - almost a sort of "inside joke" that only Al and I would understand right away: even though the fully closed position seems to favor his defensive style, the tactical breaks and chances all belong to me at the moment.} Bxd5 20. Bxd5 Ne7 21. Bg2 h5 22. b5 Ng6 23. Nb4 axb5 {?! Black only makes things tense for himself with this exchange. White's a-pawn is now a potential game-winner.} 24. cxb5 h4 25. Bd5 Kh7 {Playing to g7 wasn't much better, with White's dark-squared Bishop looming on the other long diagonal, and a nasty break in the works after White plays his f-pawn to f4. However, at least ...Kg7 didn't block the h-file for Black's Rooks, which is what I was playing for.} 26. Kg2 {Now the file becomes available for White's Rooks instead, if Black insists on prying it open.} Nh6 27. Bc4 {?? Just awful. Instead 27. a6!! is a killer shot that wins material by force. If 27. ...b6  28. a7 wins the Rook or nets White a new Queen. If 27. ...ba6  28. ba6 Be7  29. a7 leads to great woe for Black as well. In fact White could have played the pawn to a6 with dire effect as early as the 24th move. Removed from the long diagonal, suddenly White's light-squared Bishop becomes nothing but a spectator instead of a game-winner. Let *that* be a lesson about the power of Bishops on the long diagonals for you, chess beginners.} g4 28. hxg4 {?! This is dubious. White should let Black do all the pawn exchanging on these files, a step farther than the reach of Black's Knights. The correct move was 28. Bd5! reopening the threat of 29. a6!! After working up a winning position, White is now doing his best to throw it away through passive waiting moves and ill-advised pawn exchanges. ----- Let that also be a lesson to you, chess beginners: always look for the most forcing moves that will give you an advantage, however small or large it may be, and then play them. Dithering has its place at times; but generally one should never dither in chess unless circumstances *demand* it.} fxg4 29. a6 {But there's no sting to it now. The correct move is STILL 29. Bd5!} bxa6 30. Nc6 axb5 {Black's best chance. If 30. ...Rb6  31. Ra6 followed by 32. Ba5. White is still winning of course, but disappointingly missed making this a beautiful positional victory over a good positional player by overlooking 27. a6!!} 31. Nxb8 bxc4 32. dxc4 hxg3 33. fxg3 Bg5 {Suddenly Black has all sorts of counterplay for his Exchange-down. This is the price you pay for not playing forcing moves, beginners; keep it in mind.} 34. Nc6 Rf3 {! Much nastier than ...Be3, and completely justified. Knowing he still loses this particular Exchange-down endgame, Black is trying to spin a mating web around White's suddenly all-too-exposed King. There is no stopping the threat of ...Nf5.} 35. Ra7 Bxe3 {Is there a better move here? I can't find one, although I certainly don't like the text because it allows White's pieces to spring to life again.} 36. Rxc7+ Kh8 37. Be1 Nf5 38. c5 {Arrrg! White's little mental errors are becoming critical. The correct move was 38. Rb1 or a1.} Bxc5 39. Ra1 Ne3+ 40. Kh2 Nf1+ 41. Kg2 Nh4+ {!?!? An all-or-nothing shot, the swindling move, so beautiful even though it shouldn't win!! The correct move here is 42. Kh1!! and White still wins.} 42. gxh4 Ne3+ {Urrrrk!! Gag!! Suddenly I see clearly what I've done to myself. Now I just have to make sure Al sees it too.} 43. Kh2 Rh3+ 44. Kg1 Nc2+ {I actually expected him to play ...Nd5 but the text drives the stake into White's heart just as emphatically.} 45. Kf1 Nxa1 {White's position is hopeless, and he resigns. What a shocker, from squandering a won game at move 27 to suicidally engineering a complete crash-and-burn by move 45, thanks to Black's absolutely beautiful swindling move and just one second of inattention immediately following it. This is truly what we call snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. ---But most of the credit has to go to Black's fighting spirit; he never gave up. Great game, Al!}
