1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3 Nxe4 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Bxd5 Qxd5 7. Nc3 Qd8 8. Qe2 Bg4 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 Nd4 11. Qe4 Bd6 12. Ne2 {Up to this point, it has all been played before (Trunov-Gorbunov, Donskoj, 2003), but White should now continue with his development by playing 0-0.} Qe7 {0-0 may be slightly better.} 13. Qxb7 O-O 14. Qe4 Ne6 {Having sacrificed a pawn you need to be more forceful: 14...f5 was best.} 15. d3 {The wrong plan from White. He should castle and then fianchetto the bishop.} Rab8 {I still like ...f5.} 16. b3 {A poor move. Castling was the first priority. Also, by putting all his pawns on white squares, he leaves himself weak on the black squares.} Bb4+ {Giving White an awkward problem - good!} 17. Bd2 Bxd2+ 18. Kxd2 {White still has the advantage because of his extra pawn. In addition, Black's remaining queenside pawns are isolated and therefore weak.} Qg5+ {Protecting the e-pawn with gain of tempo - good!} 19. Kc3 {At this point Black needs to make a plan. Should he try to win back the pawn? Should he try to exploit White's king position? Should he try to exploit White's queen position? How can he make use of the two semi-open files? Can he make constructive use of the two weak pawns?} Rb5 {The first priority is to develop the rook on f8. 19...Rb5 is okay if Black's plan is to double rooks. } 20. Kb2 Nc5 {Chasing the queen around doesn't really achieve anything. 20...f5 looks good at first glance, but after 21.Qc4 Black is in some difficulty. 20...Rd8 or 20...Rb8 is best.} 21. Qg4 Qf6 {21...Nxd3  is playable and leads to a draw by perpetual check.} 22. Raf1 {A bad move. Rooks shouldn't be used to defend pawns. There was nothing wrong with the simple 22.f3. In fact, the pawn doesn't need defending straight away - 22.Qc4 improves the position of the queen whilst also attacking the rook. An alternative was to play Rhf1, not to defend the pawn but to support its advance.} e4+ {Not as good as it looks, because White can answer with 23.d4. Developing the rook on f8 is still the best move.} 23. Kb1 {Allowing Black to regain his pawn.} exd3 24. cxd3 Nxd3 25. Qd4 {The only satisfactory answer to the threat of mate.} Qxd4 {25...Qg6 may have given Black a better chance of winning the game.} 26. Nxd4 Rg5 {The rook should occupy one of the open files. 26...Rd5 can be followed up by ...Rfd8. The rooks must work in tandem.} 27. g4 Rd8 {Now this isn't so good because it allows White a fork.} 28. Nc6 Ra8 {The rook is no better here than it was on f8.} 29. f4 Rc5 30. Rf3 {White needs to get rid of that powerful knight and this appears to be the only way.} Nxf4 31. Nb4 Nd5 {Rook endings are notoriously difficult to win, so it might have been better to keep the knights on.} 32. Nxd5 Rxd5 33. Re1 {White's best plan was to pressurize the weak pawn on c7 with Rc1 and Rfc3.} Rad8 {Better late than never!} 34. Rfe3 g6 35. Rc3 Rd5d1+ 36. Rxd1 Rxd1+ 37. Kc2 Ra1 38. a4 Ra2+ 39. Kb1 {Kd3 must be better.} Rh2 40. Rxc7 Rxh3 41. Ka2 Rg3 42. Rxa7 Rxg4 {If we could take the rooks off, it's an easy win for Black, but with them still on the board, it's probably a draw.} 43. Rb7 h5 {I think this is where it starts to go wrong. White will win a straight race, so Black needs an alternative strategy. He should probably move his rook to a better position before he starts advancing his pawns.} 44. Rd7 {I don't know why he didn't just play a5.} h4 {Now Black is ahead in the race!} 45. Rd1 h3 46. Rh1 Rh4 47. a5 Kg7 48. a6 g5 49. Ka3 g4 50. Kb2 g3 {50...Rh8 51.a7 Ra8 wins.} 51. a7 {Now Black can only draw.} g2 {This loses. ...Rh8 was again the best move.} 52. a8=Q gxh1=Q 53. Qxh1 f5 54. Ka3 Kf6 55. b4 Kg5 56. b5 Kg4 57. b6 {}
