1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 b5 {4. ............... b5 - a lesser known offshoot of the Ruy Lopez, hoping for a Noah's Ark Trap.} 5. Bb3 f6 {5. ......... f6 - supports e pawn, but will have to delay kingside castling because of my lsb's control of g8.} 6. c3 {6. c3 - preparing bolt hole for my lsb if black starts queenside pawn roll.} Bb7 7. O-O Na5 8. Re1 Nxb3 9. Qxb3 {9.  Qxb3 - I allow the exchange of lsb for knight because Glenda my queen, replaces the lsb on that long diagonal in my previous note.} c5 10. d3 Bd6 11. Nbd2 Ne7 12. Nf1 Qb6 {12.  ........ Qb6 - black appears to have a better spatial advantage that white but sometimes things are not always what they seem.} 13. Bd2 a5 14. Qc2 O-O-O 15. a3 {15.  My last moves have been very, very, innocuous (a developing move by my bishop to d2, a queen retreat to c2 and a subtle pawn push to a3) but there is a stinger.  All will become very clear, very soon.} a4 16. Reb1 {16. Reb1 - I look at black's queenside castling position, with black's pawn pushes it is looking a little draughty.  I move my rooks here because if things open up, they have a lovely access through to the black king.} Bc7 17. Be1 h6 18. b3 {18. b3 - another innocuous pawn push, but with the rooks behind it I am starting to carry out my threat of opening black up a bit.} Bc6 19. bxa4 d6 {19. .............. d6? - loses pawn.} 20. axb5 Be8 21. c4 {21. c4 - backs up pawn on b5 - now look at the white camp.  White is two clear pawns up, passers at that and supported by 2 white rooks bearing down on the castled position and there is also Glenda on c2, lurking around and waiting to pounce!} Kd7 22. a4 Bh5 23. a5 Qb7 24. b6 {24. b6! Passed pawns must be pushed - and look, the black dsb is trapped!  Black decides to take off the b pawn now leaving me a clear piece up.} Bxb6 25. axb6 Qc6 26. Qa4 {26.  Qa4 - what does jstevens1 usually try and do when up in material?  The answer, EXCHANGE QUEENS!!  This should cut down any counterplay black may have up his sleeve.} Ke6 27. Qxc6 Nxc6 28. Bc3 {28. Bc3 - moving my dsb to a more active square and stopping the black knight from landing on b4 or d4.} g5 29. Nf1d2 {28. Nf1d2 - this move backs up my knight on f3 preventing a pawn break up on my kingside.  Black is trying a pawn roll on the kingside but it ain't gonna do him no good!} Rdb8 30. b7 Rh7 31. Ra8 {31. Ra8 - I may lose the b pawn but I will force an exchange of rooks - as I am already a piece up this is a good thing.} f5 32. Rxb8 Nxb8 33. exf5+ Kxf5 34. Ne4 {34. Ne4 - black has stalled on removing the b pawn.  I wonder why?  In the meantime I take advantage of the situation by improving the position of my knight on d2.  This move hits at the pawn on d6, threatening to undermine what is left of black's queenside pawn structure.} Ke6 35. Rb6 {35. Rb6 - pinning the pawn on d6.  If black now chooses to defend the d pawn with his rook then 36. Nxc5  is crushing.  Do you see how?} Nd7 36. Nxc5+ Nxc5 37. b8=Q {37. b8/Q - the black knight was lured away from the defense of b8 and now Glenda re-appears, hitting again at the hapless d6 pawn.} Nd7 38. Qxd6+ {38. Qxd6 , which after moving the knight to d7, she captures!  After this black waves the white flag.  Mate will follow very shortly.  In my next game as black called "Glenda Saves the Day" with the same opponent, Ronlum puts up a much improved performance and only an injudicious pawn move towards the end, prevents him from taking 14.7 rating points off me.}
