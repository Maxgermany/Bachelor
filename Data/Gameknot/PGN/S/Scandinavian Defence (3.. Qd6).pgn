1. e4 {Part of my series of annotations explaining the Scandinavian Defence, 1.e4 d5} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 {The modern alternative to ..Qa5} 4. d4 Nf6 5. Nf3 a6 {The queen on d6 is vulnerable to tactics involving Nb5, so ..a6 is almost always played in ..Qd6 systems} 6. Bd3 Bg4 {A line that leads to sharp play.  6.. g6 is a popular alternative} 7. O-O Nc6 8. Ne4 {The alternative 8. h3 is also good} Nxe4 9. Bxe4 f5 {?! Gameknot is good for trying experiments. This move looks totally counterintuitive with black's backward e-pawn.. but he is not totally crazy. The idea is to gambit the e- pawn (in the game 15.. e5), meanwhile black castles queenside, and either wins the pawn back by doubling major pieces on the e-file or plays ..g5 and gets strong pressure against the white king. What follows is a lesson in why ..f5 is not a good move} 10. Bxc6+ Qxc6 11. d5 Qf6 {This is my novelty. Black's plan is ..O-O-O, ..e5, ..Rd8, ..g5 (supported by the queen on f6 and the purpose of this move)} 12. h3 Bh5 13. Qd3 Bxf3 {White has given back a tempo, so black takes the knight. This allows black to play ..g5 later} 14. Qxf3 O-O-O 15. Re1 e5 {?! But consistent with the plan} 16. dxe6 e.p. Re8 17. Qe3 Kb8 18. Bd2 {The move black overlooked. Winning for white, and disrupts all black's counterplay involving ..g5 due to the threat of Bc3 (black queen and rook would be exposed to a skewer)} h5 {Feeble in comparison to ..g5, but black's idea is to create an escape square on h6 for his queen behind the h-pawn. This position is already lost for black} 19. Bc3 Qh6 20. Rad1 Bd6 {I played this move, and I could already see tactics involving Rxd6 later, but there is little better} 21. Rd5 f4 22. Qe4 Re7 23. Rxd6 cxd6 24. Bb4 Rd8 25. Qd5 f3 {Keeps alive a small hope of tactics on white's back rank. } 26. Bxd6+ Ka8 27. c4 {Threatening c5 to protect the bishop} Qg6 {Looking at tactics involving ..Qb1+} 28. g3 h4 29. g4 {Logical. Killing all black's counterplay on the kingside.} Ree8 30. b4 Qc2 31. Re3 Qb1+ 32. Kh2 Qxa2 33. Rxf3 Qa4 34. b5 Qa5 35. Rf7 Qb6 36. c5 Qxb5 37. e7 {Black resigns}
