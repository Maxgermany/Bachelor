1. e4 c5 2. f4 {as always...} d5 {not very wrong: an early outbreak of d5...} 3. e5 {also exd5, is an option: but after Nf6, White is enjoying no picknick...} h5 4. Nf3 Bf5 5. c3 {way ahead of the game: after Nc6, the Knight will have no moves...} e6 6. d4 {time to break formation...} Nc6 7. Bd3 {developing and attacking: that is the way to go...} Bxd3 8. Qxd3 c4 9. Qc2 b5 {the logical way to go, in the Sicilian...} 10. Be3 Nh6 {aiming for Nf5, and Be3...} 11. h3 {at least no Ng4: that would spoil a lot...} Be7 12. Nbd2 Nf5 13. Bf2 {also preventing Ng3...} O-O {castling into trouble: in my humble opinion...} 14. O-O-O {indigenous in some White play against the Sicilian: castling long...} a5 15. g4 hxg4 16. hxg4 Nh6 17. Bh4 b4 {Black is all wrong here: the play is not on the Queens' wing...} 18. g5 Nf5 19. Rdg1 {taking the venom, out of Ne3...} g6 20. Bf2 {and again, Whites' DSB restores the order...} bxc3 21. bxc3 Ba3+ 22. Kd1 Qb6 23. Rh2 {preparing mate, after Rgh1, followed by Rh8+, Kg7, R1h7...} Ng7 24. Rgh1 f5 {after Nh5?!, Rxh5, gxh5, Rxh5, things are getting very unclear: Qc2-h7 is threatening mate; this is not better...} 25. Rh2h8+ Kf7 26. Rxf8+ Rxf8 27. Nb1 Be7 28. Ke2 {bringing the King to safety...} Rb8 29. Be3 Qb2 30. Kd2 Nh5 {time to disrupt Blacks' illusions...} 31. Qxb2 Rxb2+ 32. Kc1 Rxa2 33. Nh4 Re2 34. Bd2 {shutting off, Re2...} a4 35. Kd1 Ng3 36. Rg1 Rxd2+ {maybe the best trade for Black...} 37. Nxd2 a3 38. Kc2 Ne4 39. Nhf3 Na5 40. Ra1 Nf2 41. Nb1 Nb3 42. Ra2 {losing the toss in tempo...} Nd3 43. Nxa3 Nxf4 44. Nb5 Nh3 45. Ra7 Kf8 46. Nc7 {threatening Nxe6+: a simple Kf7 could do the trick...} Nxg5 {greed, before the fall...} 47. Nxg5 Bxg5 48. Nxe6+ {1-0...}
