1. e4 {In this game black deviates from normal lines immediately and pays a heavy price. This game is an instructive game that demonstrates what happens when you move your queen out too early.} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 {This a blunder. For one it hampers blacks development of the G-Knight. Second this is not the queens ideal developing square. Usually, the queens ideal developing squares are c7, e7, d7 or a5. As a rule the queen should be one of the last pieces to be developed} 3. b3 {A logical move that allows white to attack e5 from a safe distance.} Nc6 {A good move that develops a piece and defends the centre.} 4. Bb5 {This is an OK move but lacks an serious threat. I honestly do not see the point, especially if black has not plays d7-d6. Also if you are going to play b2-b3 then Bb2 is the ideal follow-up move} Nd4 {This maybe to premature it is usually better to complete your development before you bring your attack.} 5. Nxd4 exd4 {Black has eliminated his only active piece and given up most of his control of the centre.} 6. Bb2 {attacking the weak pawn} a6 {driving away the bishop is a good move} 7. Be2 Bc5 8. d3 {Well done black's exchanged has managed to give him a space advantage.} d6 {This is a blunder because it traps the dark bishop onto the queen side. better is Ne7 followed by Ne5.} 9. Bg4 Nh6 {Black could gain a tempo by playing Bxg4 followed by Na6} 10. Bf3 Bb4+ {nope this help white more than it helps black. The check has not real teeth. So why play it! If I were white I would thinking hum black has not real plan. So I can consolidate my position before black figures out what he wants to do.   Better is Bd7 which develops a piece and prepare for the connect of the rooks after 0-0} 11. Nd2 g5 {Bad move! you should never move the pawn from the side you intend to castle. Black should castle immedaitely} 12. h3 c5 {black is just wasting time now. Bd7 or 0-0 is better} 13. O-O Rg8 {I can understand the fact that black has lauded himself into a false sense of security. However, b5 should be played to prevent white from playing Nc4.} 14. Nc4 {This is a ideal outpost for the knight} g4 15. hxg4 Bxg4 {wrong way to capture! Bishops are better in the endgame so do not be in a hurry to exchange them . } 16. Bxg4 Nxg4 17. f3 Ne5 18. Nxe5 dxe5 {black has managed to seal the centre. His plan should be to manovure his bishop to the king side where he can attack the king} 19. Rf2 O-O-O 20. g4 {a critical mistake by white. Black can win with the immediately with h5!} Rgh8 21. Rh2 Rdg8 22. Qf1 h5 {Black can play Bc3 to exchange white's dark bishop followed by Qc5 to seize control of the dark squares.} 23. Qg2 Kd7 24. Qg3 Bd2 {blunder! drops the bishop.} 25. Rxd2 Qg5 26. Rg2 Qe3+ 27. Kf1 Qg5 {not good! the queen is much stronger on e3 for the moment. Black can try to win with h4!} 28. Bc1 Qf6 29. Ke2 {...h4 is still playable. } Rg6 {too slow. Black has to play with vigor if he hopes to win.} 30. Bd2 b6 {Black has made many moves that have done little to help him. Ba5 is not real threat because most of blacks pawns are on light squares. } 31. Rh1 b5 32. Rgh2 h4 33. Rh2xh4 Rhg8 34. Qh3 Qg7 35. g5+ Kc7 36. Rh6 Kb6 37. Rh7 Qf8 38. f4 a5 39. f5 Rc6 40. Qg3 c4 41. bxc4 bxc4 42. Qxe5 cxd3+ 43. cxd3 {}
