1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 c5 {Not a move I encounter often.  I think I react correctly but get into the kind of position that doesn't suit me.} 4. exd5 exd5 5. Qe2+ {?! Not sure about this as it blocks in my B and leaves d4 undefended.} Be7 6. dxc5 {winning an unimportant pawn temporarily: probably better than just giving mine up but it doesn't help my development.} Nf6 7. Nf3 O-O 8. Be3 Nc6 9. g3 {a bit late to start fianchettoing, I think.  Better to move the Q and develop the B centrally} Bg4 10. Bg2 {? allowing the central pawn advance, forking my minor pieces, which I just missed completely: moving too fast again.} d4 11. Rd1 {pinning the pawn to hold off the inevitable material loss awhile} Bxc5 {bang goes that extra pawn} 12. O-O Qa5 {bang goes the pin.  My game gets worse and worse...} 13. Bd2 dxc3 14. Bxc3 Qb6 15. Bxf6 {although it's never advised to swap when material down, I take the opportunity to break up his k-side while I can} gxf6 16. Qe4 {and break the pin on the N while preparing to attack the doubled pawn} f5 17. Qf4 Ne7 18. Rd7 {a rook on the 7th rank always makes me feel better - but is it any use?} Ng6 19. Qg5 {my Q is getting chased around now but at least it's found an attacking position} Rab8 {mysterious... presumably he's concerned about my N moving and my B attacking b7 and a8} 20. Nh4 Be2 21. Nxg6 {I preferred this to moving the R, allowing 21....Bxf2 } hxg6 22. Rb1 {but now I have to move it anyway} Bxf2+ 23. Kh1 Be3 24. Qe7 Bc5 {As he played his checkmate at the end, tarriff178 advised me to look at move 25: "Look at move 25. You could have taken my Bishop with QxBc5".  I'm looking but it seems to me he just takes back with Qxc5.  What have I missed?  25. Qxe2 looks good though and was part of my original thinking, skewering the 2 Bs from e7.  One of the problems playing lots of games simultaneously on line is that I easily lose my train of thought, so probably just forgot what I'd planned and failed to spot the hanging B.  Note to self: study the board before moving!} 25. Qh4 {??} Bb5 26. Rdd1 Bc6 27. Qh3 Bxg2+ 28. Kxg2 {?? 28. Qxg2 might have lasted slightly longer.} Qc6+ 29. Kf1 Qf3+ 30. Ke1 Qf2# {a real shocker by me.  But well played tarriff178 for taking advantage.}
