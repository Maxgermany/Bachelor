1. e4 {Mini Tournament, I'm playing white and begin with the Open Game.} e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. d4 {Petroff's Defense, I play the Steinitz Variation.} Nxe4 4. Bd3 d5 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6. Qe2 {Putting extra pressure on the center. It can't last long. The important factor is that black is attacking a defended knight on e5 with even material (knight for knight) while white is attacking an under-defended knight on e4 threatenting to win a pawn. Black's knight cannot retreat from e4 or black will lose his queen: 6. ... Nf6?? 7. Nc6+.} Nxe5 7. Bxe4 dxe4 8. Qxe4 Be6 9. Qxe5 {The exchanges are done and white ends up a pawn to the good.} Qd7 10. O-O O-O-O 11. Be3 {Black doubly attacked the pawn on d4, white defended it.} Bb4 12. c3 f6 13. Qg3 Be7 14. Nd2 {Just jockeying around for position and developing pieces.} h5 15. f3 g5 16. c4 {Black is threatening a pawn avalanche aimed at the white king, but he seems adequately defended with two pieces and the white queen standing by for the defense.} f5 17. f4 {Inviting black to break up his pawns, and preventing black from playing 17. f5 and forking the white queen and bishop.} h4 18. Qf2 Bf6 19. d5 {White's pawn at d4 was threatened, and moving it exposes an attack against the undefended b2 pawn, but first black needs to deal with the attack against his bishop on e6. The crucial success of the attack against e6 is that it begins, after exd6, by threatening black's queen. No counter action by black is likely to succeed unless it puts equal pressure on white's queen, or threatens checkmate.} gxf4 20. dxe6 {Black initiated a counter attack that must lose material because his queen is now en prise.} Qd3 21. Qxf4 Rhg8 22. Rae1 {Black is now down a knight and a pawn, but at least he has open files aimed at white's king if he can exploit them. One threat now is 22. ... Bg5 which would win the white bishop on e3, and moving the bishop means losing the knight on d2, so white defends the bishop.} Bg5 23. Qxg5 {This begins the winning combo, a strategic queen sacrifice aimed at removing black material and promoting the advanced passed white pawn.} Rxg5 24. Bxg5 {Capturing the black rook and attacking the remaining rook forces black to spend a tempo retreating the rook. 24. ... Rg8 threatens the undefended white bishop on g5, but allows white to play 25. e7! and black cannot capture the bishop for it costs him his queen: 25. ... Bxg5?? 26. e8=Q+ Qd8 27. Qxd8 Kxd8 leaving white two rooks and a knight against black's rook.} Re8 25. e7 {Black prevented the easy promotion, but promotion is still on the way.} c6 26. Nb3 {26. Nb3! is the winning move. Any knight move opens the d-file for a white rook, but only 26. Nb3! covers both d4 and c5 to keep black from stalling with checks. Any other knight move would allow black to play 26. ... Qxc4, 27. ... Qc5+ and 28. ... Rxe7, which would have invalidate the noble white queen's sacrifice. However, as played, Black has no queen moves that offer check without losing the queen. Regardless of black's next move, white will play 27. Rd1 followed soon by Rd8+ forcing black to play Rxd8 and then exd8=Q+ and the new queen is defended by the white bishop, and this is checkmate if black doesn't move the b7 pawn or put his queen somewhere to capture the newly promoted pawn (leaving white an unopposed rook+knight endgame). Black resigned.}
