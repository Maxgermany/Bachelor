[Opening "Blackburne shilling gambit (C50)"]

1. e4 {This amateur starts with a basic opening.} e5 {Blackburne tries nothing esoteric, going with the Classical response.} 2. Nf3 {The best second move available in this position.} Nc6 {Blackburne continues on standard lines.} 3. Bc4 {The "Quiet Game" -- but not this time.} Nd4 {Now the sparks begin to fly.} 4. Nxe5 {White snatches the loose KP.} Qg5 {Blackburne attacks the unprotected Knight and menaces the weak K-side with his Q.} 5. Nxf7 {A seemingly winning move, as the protected Knight forks Blackburne's Q and R.} Qxg2 {Blackburne retaliates by attacking the White KR. If 6 NxR, 6...QxR ch followed by 7... QxKP ch equalizes the material and gives Blackburne the initiative. Furthermore, White's Knight at R8 would be in danger of being trapped.} 6. Rf1 {White hastily moves his Rook out of danger. However, he has cut off a flight-square for his King in doing so.} Qxe4+ {Decisive. 7 Q-K2 would be answered by 7... NxQ, with a winning advantage in material. So White plays instead...} 7. Be2 {...this move, which allows...} Nf3# {...a delightful finish!}
