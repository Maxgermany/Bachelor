[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf"]

1. e4 {Here is a short English Attack in the Sicilian, when Black adopts a true Najdorf setup with ...e5.  The action gets going quickly out of the opening with an opposite side castling situation and direct attacks against the kings.  Note:  As usual, my annotations assume some prior knowledge of chess, therefore, you won't find me annotating a move like 2...c5, or 3. d4.  My annotations are not for the rank beginner.  Thanks!} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf Sicilian was first played in 1937 Warsaw in Steiner-Najdorf and resulted in a victory for Black.  The variation employed in that particular game is now referred to as the Schveningen-Najdorf, as it features an early ...e6.  The variation with ...e5, was first played in 1942 by Karel Opocensky.  Najdorf would not take up the line with any regularity until 1955.} 6. f3 {This is the modern move order to reach the English Attack.  Previously, 6. Be3 was the main line, however, the obvious 6...Ng4 can take a swat at the bishop and force it to move again.  While this is not a threat to the existence of the English Attack, the theory does run deep, and by choosing the 6. f3 move order, I have been able to streamline my study.} e5 {Continuing in the vein of the "True" Najdorf.  Mentioned earlier is a Scheveningen-type setup with 6...e6.  } 7. Nb3 {The knight has been forced to decentralize and Black has good control over the d4-square.  In return, he weakens the d5-square and the d6-pawn.  Black also has good counter-chances on the queenside due to the a6-pawn spring loading the pawn storm.} Be6 {The most natural square for the bishop, as Black wants to contest the d5-square.  As usual in the Sicilian, if Black can expand with ...b5- and/or ...d5, the game will most of the time be an equal contest.} 8. Be3 {Developing the queenside to prepare for rapid castling and pressing on the weakened dark-squares created by ...a6.} Be7 { } 9. Qd2 {Both sides seek to shield their kings before commencing any attack.} O-O { } 10. O-O-O { } Nbd7 {Black reinforces the dark-squares and also keeps the c-file unobstructed.  White will push the g- and h-pawns and Black will attack down the c-file and throw forward the b- and a- pawns.  Straight forward and violent.} 11. g4 { } b5 {The race begins...} 12. g5 { } b4 {Fischer chose 12...Nh5 against Robert Byrne in 1971, more recently in the 2007 World Cup Bu Xiangzhi chose this move, the more aggressive 12...b4.  On the face, ...Nh5 does seem to be a solid defensive move, as Black can keep the g-file closed and block the h-file.} 13. gxf6 {After I played this move, I checked the database to see how popular this move was, and it turns out that this move is relatively rare.  Only 17 games in the Chessbase Database.  Opening the g-file seems quite an important factor in the attack against the Black king.} bxc3 {Forced.} 14. Qxc3 {Again forced.  14. bc would weaken the dark-squared around my king.} Nxf6 {The only sensible recapture, avoiding losing the d-pawn or opening the g-file further.} 15. Rg1 {Nothing fancy here, just direct attacking play.} Rc8 { } 16. Qd2 { } Qc7 { } 17. Kb1 {Scooting the king off the c-file and preparing, if necessary, to play Rc1 to defend the c-pawn.} a5 {Black throws his last remaining foot soldier at my king position.  Black's attack is not dangerous.  White's, however, is just gaining speed.} 18. Bh6 {The direct assault begins!!!} Nh5 {The only move to avoid material losses.} 19. Ba6 {A little finesse I wanted to throw in, to get the rook to move off of the c-file, the purpose will be clear in the next move.} Rca8 { } 20. Be2 {Now if Black returns to the c-file with ...Rac8, White would have the move Be2 for free!} a4 {Forcing the knight to c1, as I dont want any bishop sac tricks on the a-pawn.} 21. Nc1 { } Bc4 {Double-question mark.  Black had to play ...Bf6 to guard against my next move.  Tactically it fails, but why would the attacker want to exchange more pieces anyway?} 22. Bxg7 {Black is faced with disasterous material losses.} Nxg7 { } 23. Qh6 { } Bg5 {Black must return the piece to clear the 7-th rank for defense, but this overloads the queen and the bishop on c4 drops.} 24. Rxg5 { } f6 {Too many jobs for the queen.} 25. Bxc4+ {Thanks to my opponent for the interesting game!!!}
