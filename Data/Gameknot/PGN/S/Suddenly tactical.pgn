[Opening "Queen's bishop game (D02)"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bf4 {My favourite. I can be attacked, but I move the game under known ground... at least, I thought it.  If he goes for the bishop (Nh5), I can choose between three moves (Bg3, Bg5 or even Qd2). } e6 {Not as sharp as Bf5, but again, these are known lines, too...} 4. h3 {This is "not" a loss of tempo. Because my plan is to shield with c3 and push g4 early. A risky plan I like. } Nc6 5. e3 {...and now, if Nh5, Bh7.} Be7 {If Bd6, Ne5. } 6. g4 {Opening a hole in h4 that has to be controlled, I know. But black may feel a little pressed, and move into our game. } Bd7 {Nothing special, black is playing conservatively. Normally, this means I will attack trying to avoid him to castle longside, which normally I cannot avoid. But some moves has to be played still before we get to that point. } 7. Nbd2 {g5 must be further prepared, by clearing f3, so Nh5 is not possible. } Ne4 {Normal and good. I can seal the hole in h4 by playing a pawn there, but I wanted to try another move. The one that can go to h4 is a simple bishop, not Her Majesty.} 8. Bd3 f5 {Good. Now white is tangled. } 9. gxf5 {I will have soon to care for h4, so I better avoid fxg4. And I open a potential attack line in g, but not easy to exploit. } exf5 10. h4 {Hole sealed again. } Bd6 {Now things goes interesting and tactical. If BxB, NxB and black has a solid game, since the queen can go to e7 defending g2 and can castle queenside. So I played for scrambling the game.  } 11. Ne5 Bxe5 {He loses the bishop for a knight, true is that this was a good knight. But I cannot take BxB without returning him the favour, and after NxB, exN, the game is completely different. } 12. dxe5 Be6 {e6 is not a threat, but it will. So this is a profilactic move, but condemn the bishop. It has a good defensive role, though.} 13. Qh5+ {Let's see what happen. He can't Bf7 because of Qxf5. } g6 {Ok, the expected one. } 14. Qh6 {Now he has a hole in g5. If only I wouldn't have to lose a tempo moving the lsb after NxN, I'll go for Bg5-f6 with a good grimp on black. } Qd7 {Covering g7 and allowing o-o-o.} 15. Nxe4 {Maybe impatient. Nf3 was probably better, threatening Ng5.} dxe4 16. Be2 {Aiming to h5, but the plan was miscalculated, I had to castle queenside before. Will I be able to have some advantage from the column or not?} O-O-O {Er... not inmediately. My, I'm suddenly in danger. } 17. Bg5 {Qd2+, Kf1, Rd5, Bf6, and probably black has something related to Nxe5 at some point. } Rde8 {The conservative but good move. } 18. Bf6 Rhg8 19. O-O {Risky, as often. It was excessive. } f4 20. Qxf4 {Keeping control on d4.} h6 21. Rad1 {At last! But I have to stop the attack on my poor kingside now. } Qf7 22. Qxe4 Bf5 {I don't want him to take control of the game, so it is time to mix up things again... Specially, I don't want to concede e5 without fight. } 23. Bc4 Be6 {Only defence. But it was interesting (with more time) for black to explore BxQ, BxQ, Bxc2, Rd2, Ba4, b3, Bc5, Rfd1, but conceding the exchange was doubtful...} 24. Bd5 {After the exchanges, Rxd5 defends e5.} Bxd5 25. Rxd5 {Overlooking QxB, exQ, RxQ. My blunder. } g5 {Mistake, allowing...} 26. Qf5+ Kb8 {And this opens the possibility of a back rank mate.} 27. Rd7 Qe6 28. Qxe6 Rxe6 29. hxg5 hxg5 {This way, his own pawn protects my king. } 30. Rfd1 {Setting clearly a back rank threat.} Nxe5 {The definitive blunder. A pity.} 31. Rd7d8+ {}
