1. e4 {. } e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 dxe4 5. Nxe4 cxd4 6. Qxd4 Qxd4 7. Nxd4 {Black has exchanged queens, but is far behind in development and needs to play carefully.} Bd7 {Develops and protects against a check and pin. An alternative to consider was... a6 to prevent the N from going to b5.} 8. Bf4 {Preparing for pressure on d6 and 0-0-0. The alternative 8 Nb5, Na6 9 Nbd6  was to be considered.} Nc6 {...Nc3?! overlooks the strength of 10. Nb5! in this position.} 9. Nb5 Bb4+ {This check gives the black king some room but does not solve Black's problems.} 10. c3 Ba5 11. Nbd6+ {Wins a pawn and forces the king to move.} Kf8 12. Nxb7 Bb6 13. Nbc5 {Threatens the other bishop.} Bc8 14. Bb5 {Attacks the exposed knight. Whites pieces are swarming.} Nce7 15. Bd6 {Pins the Knight, threatening 16 Bc6.} Bxc5 16. Nxc5 {Black tries to exchange pieces to gain some freedom.} a6 17. Ba4 {Now 0-0-0 followed by Nd7  is threatened. Black tries to develop.} Nf6 18. O-O-O Ne8 {Black wants to drive off the bishop. } 19. Bf4 {Threatens Rd8.} Ra7 {19...Ra7?? Necessary was 19...f6, 20 Rd8, Kf7, though black remains cramped and a pawn down.} 20. Rd8 {Finito! Black can only avoid mate by giving up a piece, and resigns. Interesting how quickly what are seemingly fairly normal defensive moves entangle the black position.}
