[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 {This game was played in 5 days, more or less. Too quick by each side. Specially, his. Since he was in a strong position after the opening, but I could surprise him with a tactic.} Nf6 2. e3 {No way, it is difficult to find someone playing the "normal" c4, in order to practice the Budapest. Now, I have to improvise. And the db offers the widest variety of followings... too many to study them. } b6 {It seems to be a good idea to fight for the white diagonal. It is not true... but it is a plan.} 3. Nf3 e6 {To fianchetto the other bishop is possible, and possibly good. But two "passive" moves are too much for my style. I am planning c5, of course...} 4. Bd3 Bb7 5. c4 c5 6. Nc3 {Just getting even, and boring. I can play d5, transposing to something that I think is called the Tartakower. I am always defeated playing with white... but as black, I am not sure how to go on, so I tried to get some movement. } cxd4 7. exd4 {Ok. His pawns are strong. And my dsb has not a good place to go, unless I change it with the c3 knight. Hmmm... Anyway: I am delaying to move the d pawn, in order to control e5 with d6. And I don't like to play the bishop on e7, it's just too passive. So, I tried something else. } h6 {...with the intention to get rid of his dsb after Bf4, g5, etc... } 8. Qe2 {Planning an early attack on the semi-open e column, taking advantage of the position of my king, still far from castling due to my stupid idea of delaying developement. } g5 {A plan is a plan. This is in order to provoke, after g4, Ne5, d6. Trying to control the game, that is already going out of it...} 9. O-O a6 {Another loss of time... but Nb5 is really bad for me. If I want to develop my queen to c7 and my bishop to d6, I had to prevent the knight's jump. } 10. d5 {No problem. Everything but avoiding the white diagonal to be blocked. d5 whorted a look... but I wanted to keep to my plan of d6. } Qe7 {YES! Why not? My dsb can always develop on g7, controlling a very nice open diagonal...} 11. dxe6 dxe6 {I am not really in a nice position, but I was not so stupid as to play Qxe6. Besides, I had to give the Nb8 a square, since I didn't want it to block my bishop's action on the white diagonal. His queen has to take care of BxN, always. And if he jumps to d4, this is not a very dangerous position for me... not right now. } 12. Be3 {Yummy pawn, isn't it?  But I have made room for my knight on purpose... } Nbd7 13. Rad1 g4 {Time to be aggressive, and go on with my plan. I think I cannot longer dream of a real attack, but... the "normal" Bg7 is just too slow. White clouds are condensing in the nearest skies...} 14. Nd4 {I thought about e5, but... no, it is too dangerous. } Ne5 {When in danger, exchange. His dangerous bishop is the dsb, not the lsb, but it is better than nothing. } 15. Bf4 Nxd3 16. Rxd3 {Winning a tempo to double the rooks on the d column... this is going... whiter and whiter .-)} O-O-O {Last try. This is a yummy move for him! You see: to attack the c5 pawn is not a plan. It is too easy for him to defend it. So, just let it be. More than that: be prepared NOT to exchange it if he advances it, in order not to open the c column for his threatening rooks.  I confess, at this point, that I honestly believed I will lose.} 17. Na4 {Ok, ok, now I have an ugly duty: to defend it with the queen. } Qb4 {Qc2 and I almost resign. But he didn't play it. } 18. b3 Be4 {Now, a breath. This "os√®" move, and I have space to move my king to b7. More than that, I prevent his Qe5! It was a good moment to get the dsb out of it initial square? Maybe, but after Be6, I had to retreat it. And, I insist, I didn't want to passively play it on e7. On g7, maybe. But it will be aiming to an empty diagonal... } 19. Rdd1 {Rd2 was better, in my opinion, not losing the advantage of a possible developement of the f1 rook. } Bd6 {It was a pity to exchange my bishop, but Bc5, NxB, and HIS bishop will be too dangerous over the black squares. } 20. a3 Qa5 {Now I am threatening e5? Not at all. But it is better than nothing. Now, if he plays Bd2, I will lose b3 and the game. } 21. Bxd6 {Nice for me!} Rxd6 22. Nc2 {Ugly. He could play Qe3, adding pressure to the weak b6. } Rhd8 {Now, the situation is less unbalanced. My pieces are all playing... } 23. Rxd6 Rxd6 {Thank you. Now he has to lose a tempo in order to get his rook into the attack. } 24. Rd1 {Oh oh. He doesn't see a wonderful combination here... I did!} Rxd1+ 25. Qxd1 Bxc2 {And he cannot take back the bishop because of the mate in e1! But he could play Nxb6+... anyway, a piece less with no compensation (ALMOST no compensation) must have seemed a suffering, after such a promising opening... }
