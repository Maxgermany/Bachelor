1. Nf3 d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. c4 c6 4. Nc3 {The main starting position of the Slav defence, White skipped the exchange variation 4.cxd5. Black can now play 4...e6 Semi-Slav, 4...a6 Chebanenko variation, and 4.dxc4 which follows the main line. } Bf5 {This is a common error, the bishop sortie on f5 must be preceded by a move which makes impossible or useless for White the coming pressure on the now weak pawn b7. } 5. cxd5 cxd5 6. Qb3 {Now it will be extremely difficult or to say the least, impossible for Black to defend b7 and d5. White is clearly on top and begins to think how to win the game, only six moves after the beginning of the game.} Qd7 {Stubborn and naive, but finding a better move for Black is a worthless task here for the analyst.} 7. Ne5 {Reinforcing the control on white squares and chasing the Queen from her only good defensive position.} Qc7 {Leaving the pawn d5 "en prise" but White has a powerful and thematic breakthrough in the center.} 8. e4 {A sacrifice very often played in similar situations, The Bishop on f1 is joining the attack without loss of tempo. } Bxe4 {If 8...dxe4 then 9.Bb5  followed by Qxf7 crashes through Black's camp. If 8...Nxe4 then 9.Nxd5 with nasty threats all over the place. } 9. Bb5+ {If Black protects by 9...Nbd7 then 10.Nxe4 eyeing on f7 weakness.} Nc6 {Black seems to have consolidated a bit, but White soon add fuel to the attack.} 10. Bf4 {Threatening dscovered attacks on the Black Queen.} Bxg2 {Black goes for material gains as there is no successful defences on board now. For instance 10...Qc8 was doomed to 11.Nxe4 Nxe4 12.Rc1} 11. Nxc6 {Leaving the once nasty Bishop f4 "en prise"} Qxf4 {Quite forced.} 12. Ne5+ {If 12...Kd8 then 13.Ne2 attacking the Queen and opening directly the c-file for Ra1-c1 is impossible to stop.} Nd7 {Best suicide.} 13. Bxd7+ {Of course taking with the Bishop as the calculation is straightforward.} Kd8 {Forced.} 14. Qxb7 {Threatening 15.Nc6 mate.} e6 {Which is not stopped by this move.} 15. Nc6# {Checkmate}
