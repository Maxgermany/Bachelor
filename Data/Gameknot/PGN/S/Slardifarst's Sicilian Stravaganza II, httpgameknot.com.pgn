1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {the start position (tematic tournament)} 6. Nd5 {an inusual move. 6...Nxe4?? 7.Nb5! 6...Nxd5 let white a good center} Bg7 7. Bb5+ Bd7 8. O-O O-O 9. Nxf6+ {9. f3 it's no bad :P lose only a bishop with Nxd5 exd5 Bxd4  or Nxd5 Bxd7 Nxd7 exd5 Qb6} Bxf6 10. a4 a6 {Bxb5 let Ra1 to work; b5 is a good block for black pieces} 11. Bc4 Nc6 12. c3 {with a change white gain a good center} Qb6 {Qb6? black want pressure on white center but b6 is a big problem: b7 is blocked} 13. Nxc6 {without change is difficul see a way to play} Bxc6 14. Qe2 Rfd8 {a wrong...now white can use b6! 14...Qc7 is better: let b5!} 15. a5 {i think now white can play only to win!!} Qc7 16. Be3 Qd7 17. Bb6 Rdf8 18. f4 {now white have all his pieces (no Ra1) in good position, so he can star a kingside attack} e6 19. f5 {i think the best move to open kingside rook} d5 {the best defence, i think, but now black have to defend his centre...now Ra1-d1 is very dangerous, Bb6 control d8} 20. exd5 Bxd5 21. Rad1 Qc6 22. Bxd5 exd5 {isolated pawn} 23. Qf3 {Qf3! Now Rf8 is block to defend Bf6 after fxg6, Qf3 attack d5, how to defend all?} Bd8 {unic...but f6 is now possible} 24. Bf2 {sacrifice pawn to do f6! why not Bd4 or Be3 ? 24.Bd4 i think is not good becouse d5 now is defended so 24...f6 and Rad8 with a5 attacked; with b4, c3 is a serius problem 24.Be3  Re8 and f6} Bxa5 {perhaps f6 is better. 24...f6 25.fxg6 hxg6} 25. f6 Rad8 26. Qf4 Rd6 27. Bd4 Bb6 28. Rde1 {the only way! if black do Re8 white have lost a pawn} Bxd4+ 29. cxd4 Re6 30. Re5 {with idea Rh5; with 30...Rxe5 31 dxe5 white win early with Qh6} h5 {a wrong!! Rfd8 is better} 31. Rf5 {delicius move (i think) defending pawn f6 white can play Qh6} Kh7 32. Rxh5+ gxh5 33. Qg5 Rxf6 34. Rxf6 {i think this is a very good game; we can see: - how take advantage from a blocked pawn (b7) - use development advantage to start an attack}
