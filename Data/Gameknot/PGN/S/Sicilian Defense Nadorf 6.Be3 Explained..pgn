[Opening "Sicilian (B90), Najdorf, Byrne (English) attack"]

1. e4 {With 1.e4 white gains some control over central square d5 and open lines of development for his queen and kings bishop.} c5 {With 1...c5 black prevents white from playing 2.d4 and gains some control over the central square d4.} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 {White is ahead in development and can develop more freely. Black however, has a structural advantage in that he has an extra central pawn , white gains him a long-term advantage of taking control of the centre. A typical imbalance has arisen. From here white should use his development advantage in order to secure an early initiative. If White plays passively or his initiative runs out of steam,then typically its black,with the better pawn structure, who has the long-term chances. If black equalise he is already better. This structural advantage is seen in most Open Sicilian Lines for example the dragon, the najdorf and scheveningen variations. The major exception to this rule is the Sveshnikov variation in which black accepts pawn weaknesses for activity.} Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Not 5...e5 as white will play 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.Bxd7+ Nxd7 8.Nf5 and white is better. 5...a6 however prevents white from posting his knights on b5 and the Bb5+ while preparing queenside expansion.} 6. Be3 e5 {Black's expectation in this 6...e5 Najdorf Variation is that his control of important central squares, with possibilities of Q-side expansion, will more than compensate for the slight weakness of his backward Queens Pawn. Other Moves are 6...e6(Scheveningen) and the 'spoiling idea' 6...Ng4  } 7. Nb3 {The aggressive 7.Nf5 is premature. Black obtains a free game after either 7...Bxf5 8.exf5 d5! 9.Bg5 d4 10.Bxf6 or 7...d5! 8.Bg5 d4 9.Bxf6. Another idea for white is 7.Nf3 which is more positional where white's main idea is to control d5. White main moves are Bc4,Bg5,Bxf6} Be6 {Trying to obtain some control over d5.} 8. f3 {This move prevent any Ng4 idea's and prepares the moves Qd2,0-0-0,g4.} Nbd7 {The idea is to prepare to fight for the d5 square latter with b5 follow by Nb6 or just Nb6.} 9. g4 {An important space gaining move on the kingside. The positional motivation behind the idea is that white intends g4-g5, forcing the black knight to move away from its ideal posting at f6 and lessening black's control over d5-square. Note:Control of the d5-square is of utmost importance in the najdorf sicilian.} b5 {We've seen this typical lunge on the queenside before. Black initiates counterplay on the queenside. The stage is set for another uncompromising battle between the two sides. White will develop with Qd2 and 0-0-0 and if allowed, will push forward on the kingside with g4-g5. Black may forestall this advance with the defensive move ...h7-h6, or be ready to move his knight to either h5 or d7 (once the other knight has vacated this square.) If the f6-knight is forced to move elsewhere (g8, for example then this is usually a sign that things have gone wrong for black. Once again black's counterplay lies very much on the queenside. Often the fight is over the d5 square, black plays the pawn lunge ...b5-b4. This asks the question of the knight on c3, which will either jump into d5 or retreat elsewhere. Black will find it difficult to arrange the freeing advance ...d6-d5, but if white is carless enough to allow this then often this turns out to be favourable for black. In general, play is sharp and dynamic, often involving positional or tactical sacifice from both sides} 10. g5 b4 {Black responds to the attack on his king's knight with one of his own on the c3-knight. This is not an uncommon idea in the sicilian. 10...Nh5 is a sensible alternative} 11. Ne2 {11.Nd5 is another common move after 11...Nxd5 12.exd5 Bf5 13.Bd3 Bxd3 14.Qxd3 Black continues with Be7 and 0-0.  } Nh5 12. Qd2 Be7 {Preparing to castle, but black should also consider delaying this in favour of 12...a5, counter-attacking on the queenside} 13. Ng3 {Challenging the black knight on h5 and trying to fool black to open the h-file for white to use for an attack. White can grab a hot pawn with 13.Qxb4 Bxg5 14.Bxg5 Qxg5 15.Qxd6 but after 15...Rd8 Black already has a dangerous threat of 16...Qh4+} Nf4 {Not 13...Nxg3? 14.hxg3 gives white an excellent half-open h-file.} 14. h4 {Protecting the g5 pawn. Interesting is 14.Bxf4 exf4 15.Nh5 0-0 16.h4 Ne5 17.Be2} h6 {Black fight back on the kingside. Note that this an advantage of delaying castling. This wouldn't have been possible if black had already committer his king to this side of the board.} 15. Bxf4 exf4 16. Nh5 Bxb3 {Stoping any Nd4 idea's} 17. axb3 g6 18. Nxf4 hxg5 19. Nd5 Rxh4 {A mistake according to adams. Black should have played either 19...gxh4 or 19...g4} 20. Rxh4 gxh4 21. O-O-O {Now white is well co-ordinated and his attack is worth more than the pawn deficit.} Nf6 22. Bc4 Nxd5 {22..a5 is answered by 23.Qh6! , plainning to meet 23...Nxd5 with the decisive 24.Bb5+(Svidler). But in my opinion the move which was played is also bad better was 22...Rc8 or 22...Rb8} 23. Qxd5 Bg5+ 24. Kb1 Ra7 25. e5 Kf8 {Or 25...Rd7 26.e6 and white crashes through on the weakened light squares, for example 26...fxe6 27.Qxe6+ Qe7 28.Qg8+ Qf8 29.Qxg6+ and Qxg5.} 26. e6 {This is even stronger than 26.exd6} Bf6 27. exf7 Qe7 28. f4 {This move prevents ..Qe5, which would otherwise force an exchange of queens. With an opposite colour bishop ending.} Qxf7 29. Qxd6+ Qe7 30. Qb8+ Kg7 31. Rg1 {Now white targets the g-6 pawn and ther is no defence.} Kh6 32. Bd3 Rd7 33. Qg8 {Black resigns because the g-6 pawn falls and black is soon mated.}
