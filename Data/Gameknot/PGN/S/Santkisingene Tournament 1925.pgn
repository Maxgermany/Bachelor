1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. Bg5 {usualy played in these variation 5.Qc2 with the idea of advanced e4 and controll the center .} Be7 6. e3 Ne4 {good move , 6...Ne4! threats wining a piece , and activing the knight to active position when just earlier it was pinned .} 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Nxe4 Bxe4 9. Nd2 Bb7 10. Be2 {good move , idial position for the white LSB , another idea of this move is prepering 0-0 and Bf3 exchange the strong blacks LSB on b7 .} Qg5 {capturing immideatly on g2 is not a good idea because of 10...Bxg2?!.11.Rg1!-Bb7.12.Rxg7 and white have good game .} 11. Bf3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Nc6 13. Qg3 Qxg3 14. hxg3 Ke7 {when the are no Queens on the board , there is no threat of dangerous attacks on the black king , therefor Capablanca choose to enter the rooks to the game and activing the  king as prepering to an better endgame .} 15. g4 h6 16. a3 a6 17. Ke2 Rhb8 {good move  , the idea is to advanced b5 and open B file for the black rooks , if 17... b5?! was sooner played so  18.d5-exd5.19.cxd5-Ne5.20.f3 and probably drawn game . } 18. Ne4 b5 19. c5 d5 {good move , black wishes to break whites chain of pawns on the center , the idea is , after the  knight retreats to g3 or d2 , or c3 , black will play e5!.} 20. cxd6 e.p.+ cxd6 21. f4 Rbc8 22. f5 {maybe?, it was better to play .22. Rac1-Na5.23.Nc3-Nc4  and blacks chances are  in favor to win .} Na5 23. Kd3 Nc4 24. Rab1 {whites rook on b1 is in very unpleasente position however , even after 24.b3-Na5 , whites position wasnt get  better  at all.} d5 25. Nc3 {not 25.Nc5?-Ne5+.26.dxe5-Rxc5 and black with big advantage.} Rc6 26. fxe6 fxe6 27. g5 {white wishes to get reed from its double pawns on G file and, makes black Double pawns instead. however this free pawn is going to be very usefull for black .(see in blacks 31move).} hxg5 28. Rh5 Kf6 29. Rh3 {the strong position of the black knight on c4 avoiding any active game frome the other rook getting active game because of the weak pawns on the whites queenside . therefore , black's  totaly dominates the game and with the free pawn advantage makes first signs to ''the begining of the end'' for white .} Rac8 30. Na2 a5 {good move , black large his space advantage on the queenside and  even more cuts off the white pieces from the game .} 31. Rf3+ Kg6 32. g4 Nd6 {the black knight done his job on the queen side , and after the damage has been done to  white , black prepares kind of a choke ring around the whits king neck .} 33. Nc3 b4 34. axb4 axb4 35. Nd1 Rc6c2 {threating Ne4 and Re2#.} 36. Rf2 b3 37. Ra1 Ne4 38. Re2 Rc8c6 {whits pieces totally hopeless , there is no good move that white can make .} 39. Rb1 e5 {great move , white mustnt capture the pawn because of Nc5+ and black wins a rook . 40.dxe5??-Nc5+.41.Kd4-Rxe2.} 40. Ra1 Rc6c4 41. Ra5 Nc5+ {white resins . after 42.Rxc5-e4# or 42.dxc5-e4# , thank you and i hope you enjoyed the game .}
