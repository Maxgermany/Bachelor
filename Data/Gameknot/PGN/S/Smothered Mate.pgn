1. d4 {A real live case!  So I just had to share it.  This game is from Samsara's 45th Tournament, which is progressing quite nicely so far.  I started cautiously with 1. d4, planning to play a strategic game, and so it proceeded for a while, till an opportunity presented itself.} Nf6 {Black's most flexible response.} 2. c4 e6 {Apparently aiming for the Nimzo-Indian, one of Black's strongest openings.} 3. Nf3 {I take a side-step from the mainline Nimzo, inviting either the Bogo-Indian (3...Bb4) or the Queen's Indian (3...b6)} b6 {Black opts for the Queen's Indian, a double-edged opening in my experience: I don't think I have a good record either with it or against it!} 4. e3 Bb7 5. Be2 Bb4+ {Normal, I think, is 5...Be7.  This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played Nc3 but I could be wrong...} 6. Nbd2 {Given the choice, I develop the N to d2, where it is defended by my QB rather than a pawn that would be doubled, leaving an isolated rook's pawn.} Ne4 {Black initiates tactics rather than castling or developing another piece.  Understandable in the position but dubious, I feel.} 7. O-O {I unpin my Nd2 and get my K to safety.} f5 {Black strengthens control of the long diagonal by weakening the squares around his King.  Again, to my eye, this looks dubious, but I seem to remember it's a fairly standard pawn structure in the Queen's Indian.} 8. a3 {White pushes back at Black's intruders} Be7 9. Nxe4 Bxe4 10. Nd2 Bb7 {After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development.} 11. Bf3 d5 {Another typical Queen's Indian move that contests the centre but leaves the black squares looking weak and maybe isn't as strong as Black hopes.  The pawn can't take the hanging pawn on c4 because it's pinned against the Bb7.} 12. b3 {White nevertheless defends the pawn, preparing to develop his QB to b2, with the longer term aim of exploiting that long black diagonal.} O-O 13. Bb2 {The game is beginning to look like the long strategic struggle I'd originally envisaged.  White's position may be slightly stronger, with Black's QN and QR still at home, but there's not much in it.} Bf6 {Black opposes White's B on the black diagonal.  Our positions are nearly symmetrical.} 14. Rc1 {This move threatens to open up the c-file and provide attacking avenues for White.} c5 {Black responds with another symmetrical move but I think he should have got that N out by now.} 15. Qe2 {With this, White hopes to exploit the weakling on e6 and the empty f7 square.  He also prepares to centralise the other rook and maybe double on the c-file. } Qe7 {Another symmetrical move by Black but White is two tempi up...} 16. Rfe1 {White builds the pressure on the e-file before seeking to open up the position.} dxc4 {? Perhaps worried about White's plans, Black opens up the centre before he's developed his QN and QR.  White is better placed to exploit the opening lines.} 17. Bxb7 {Not only does this remove the Queen's Indian bishop but it diverts Black's Q from the centre and defence of e6.} Qxb7 18. Nxc4 {Now White's N recaptures on c4, contests control of e5 and seizes control of d6.} Nd7 {Finally Black develops his QN, fighting back for control of e5.} 19. e4 {White launches his e-pawn, aiming either for e5, gaining space and securing an outpost on d6, or for opening the position up with exf5, depending on Black's response.} Bxd4 {Black takes the d-pawn, whose defence was abandoned by White's last move - but White can live with this temporary loss of material.} 20. Bxd4 {Black's most active piece bites the dust and White's hold on the centre improves.} cxd4 21. exf5 {Now White's pawn threatens to become a monster!  I expected 21...Nc5, preventing the Q from taking on e6 and simultaneously threatening to take on b3, which would, in turn, threaten c1.  I would have ploughed on with fxe6.  Black has to be careful to avoid Re8 because of the N fork from d6.} exf5 {Now - can you see what I suddenly saw?} 22. Qe6+ Kh8 23. Nd6 {The attack on Black's Q gives White's N the tempo to set up a classic mating net.} Qb8 24. Nf7+ {To avoid immediately losing the game, Black must sacrifice the exchange on this move but I think he prefers to see the denouement :-)} Kg8 25. Nh6+ Kh8 26. Qg8+ Rxg8 27. Nf7# {Ecstasy!  Thank you father_oblivion :-)}
