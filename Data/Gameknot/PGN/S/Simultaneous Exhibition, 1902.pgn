1. e4 {The usual start.} f5 {The Duras Gambit or Fred Defence.} 2. exf5 {Logical.} Kf7 {This opening move is only good in Kriegspiel.} 3. d4 {Opening more lines of attack.} d5 {Opening a line to win back the gambited Pawn.} 4. Qh5+ {Forcing a further weakening of Black's already shattered position.} g6 {The equally bad alternative was 4... K-B3.} 5. fxg6+ {If now 5... PxP, Pillsbury wins a piece with 6 QxR.} Kg7 {Trying to block off the Pawn and find shelter for his King.} 6. Bd3 {Threatening to win at least a piece with 7 PxP.} Nf6 {Trying to drive off the powerfully posted Queen, as well as guard the threatened KRP.} 7. Bh6+ {Adding another piece to the rapidly mounting attack.} Kg8 {Forced.} 8. gxh7+ {Opening up the space around the King to allow the Q to penetrate.} Nxh7 {8... RxP was the other choice, which would have created a flight square at KR1 for the King and perhaps dragged out the resistance.} 9. Qg6+ {Mate follows next move.} Bg7 {The last gasp.} 10. Qxg7# {The end.}
