[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C68), exchange, Alekhine variation"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez -- little do I realize that my opponent has literally hundreds of games playing the white side of the exchange in the ruy...} a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {Of course black recaptures with the d-pawn, otherwise Nxe5 cannot be met by Qd4!} 5. h3 {Preventing the common black response of Bg4.} Bd6 {Protecting e5.} 6. d3 {With the light-squared bishop off the board, white has no problems making his dark-squared bishop the good bishop, and making black's dark-squared bishop bad.} h6 {Fearing a kingside buildup, but perhaps development was more necessary.} 7. O-O Nf6 8. Nbd2 O-O {This may not be the best decision.  White is building up on the kingside for sure, which means black may want to shore up his king on the other side of the board.} 9. Nc4 {Offering an exchange...} Be6 {I decide development is more important than the dark squared bishop, and hey, it undoubles my pawns, right?} 10. Ncxe5 {Oops!  Overlooked that, and now I'm down a pawn.  This is doubly bad because that e5 pawn was black's major source of central control... now the white pieces are free to run rampant!} Re8 {Trying to kick the pieces out before it's too late.} 11. Bf4 {And this move is a very good developmental move!  Previously impossible because of the pawn on e5, white now has a strong central and kingside presence, plus he's up a pawn.  White is definitely winning here.} Nh5 {?  Slow and ineffective.  After the retreat of the bishop, what is black going to do when the Nf3 moves and the queen threatens the knight?} 12. Bh2 f6 {Desperately trying to get the knight out of the center!} 13. Ng6 {But this position is even worse!  And now, what to do about the Nh5?  Look at it; it's got nowhere to run!} Kh7 {Trying to kick the knight out, or at least get some running room!} 14. Nfh4 {!  A good move, cementing the knight's positions and hoping to win the Nh5.} Bxh2+ {Stalling.} 15. Kxh2 {Of course.} Qd6+ {Hoping for something foolish.  Seriously, I'm rated 1700  and this is what my game comes down to -- a counterattack where I have to hope my opponent makes a huge mistake.  This is the strategy I stick by, by the way -- if you make it easy for your opponent he'll come and get you, but if you make as many complications as you can and create pitfalls, he just may fall into one!} 16. g3 {Alright, time to assess.  White is going to win the knight, and there's nothing I can do about that.  What's the most I can get in compensation?  So I took a think and concocted a plan that went something like:  If I play Nxg3, he'll take with the f-pawn.  He'll rush the queen over to the kingside for a big attack, and then maybe I can play for a counterattack on the 2nd rank, forcing a draw or a win if I'm lucky.} Nxg3 {Might as well give it a shot!} 17. fxg3 Bf7 {This lures the queen over to the kingside, as the knight needs another defender, and a retreat to f4 is met by the fork g5!} 18. Qg4 {Now the kingside presence looks truly menacing, but there's no obvious breakthrough, so it's time to centralize my forces and try to counter.} Qd4 {Maybe I'll pick up a couple of pawns for my troubles?} 19. b3 {?  I don't like this at all for white -- he's playing into my hands, and focusing on my phantasmal threats.  Much stronger, I thought, was Rf2 followed by Raf1, where the attack appears all but irresistable.} Qb2 {Threatening Qxc2 , winning back some pawns.} 20. Rfc1 {?!  I'm pretty sure that's the wrong rook: this takes attention away from the kingside.  I also see something else in this position...} Rad8 {The c2-pawn is pinned!} 21. Qf5 {Threatening a murderous discovered check -- white is still winning here, and I must remember to be careful!} Kg8 {Practically forced, but a good defensive move.} 22. Qf4 {?  Not sure what this was preparing for -- perhaps to defend the d2 square?  Because if he's eyeing off the c7 pawn, that's a bad plan for sure!} Rxd3 {?! Very risky, but it's the only way to play at this point.  A check on d2 is out of the question...} 23. Qxc7 {?  This may bring down the house.  This move is really bad in many ways -- it leaves the defense of black's counterattack, it abandons white's "attacking" force on the kingside (the knights look frozen right now), and it decentralizes the queen.  Black's next move is obvious...} Rd2+ {Now I expected white wouldn't play Ng2, giving up the Ng6, but I thought I'd see Kh1, the best flight square.} 24. Kg1 {?  Again -- very surprising!  This makes black's next move easy...} Qd4+ {Forcing the king to h1, where he should've been a move ago (otherwise Kf1 leads to Qf2#).  When you're trying to avoid a mating net, you *must* make every move and tempo count!} 25. Kh1 {Forced.} Qf2 {And now the game is over.  White can only delay the inevitable, by trying to prevent mate on either g2 or h2.  The best attempt, g4 (allowing the queen to protect h2 while the knight protects g2), is met by Bxg6!, where black threatens Bxe4 leading to mate, and the Nh4 cannot recapture due to Qg2#. Still, white insists on fighting it out...} 26. g4 {The best try.} Bxg6 {As promised.  Now, Nxg6 loses to Qg2#.  Black threatens Bxe4  leading to a forced mate, and, among other threats, the white Nh4 is hanging.  Rce1 is an option, but is there a way to survive Rxe4 in response?} 27. Rcf1 {This move does nothing to address the threat of Bxe4, and so the game is almost over...} Bxe4+ {And white mercifully resigns.  The finish is either 28. Nf3 Bxf3# or 28. Ng2 Qxg2#.  0-1  How lucky was I to pull this one out?  Hopefully you've learned something about counterattacking, and thanks to Remybear for a hard-fought game!}
