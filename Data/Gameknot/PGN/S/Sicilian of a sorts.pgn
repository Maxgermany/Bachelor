1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {Now these are four typical moves in the Sicilian. From here, black usually will play Nc6, although Bg4 is played too. In addition, my opponent can play g6 intending to fianchetto. There are so many different lines and transpositions possible that it's impossible for me to remember them all.} 3. Bb5+ {So my first order of business, get rid of the white bishops. I am going to control the white squares with my pawns. This does lead to a rather boring game. Some years ago, MSN hosted Kasparov against the world, and in a similar position, he apologized for choosing a similar line, because he didn't want to reveal any of his real preparation for upcoming matches for the world championship; and at that time, his apology was for the 'drawish and boring' kind of game that would result. If any of you have looked at that game, that's not how that game turned out in actuality!} Bd7 {He obliges. Nd7 was possible here, although the continuation of that could result in a long pin after c4 and Qa4. But that was not my strategy.} 4. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {Recapturing with the knight or queen is possible here.} 5. c4 {I deviate from the 'book' with this move. This is an attempt by me to emulate a little the Maroczy bind position after trading off the white bishops, allowing my knight on f3 to avoid annoying pins after I castle kingside, cramp black's position, and prevent him from opening up the c file easily. At this point in the game, black can respond in a couple of different ways: e6 is possible, Ngf6 is possible, as is a6 and g6. I like white's position because black cannot easily continue in typical Sicilian fashion. Which is why I chose to do this, because everyone knows the Sicilian is one of the better attempts by black to score the point.} g6 {And here black says: so what. I'm still going to develop my Sicilian. Appears he is looking to perhaps set up an accelerated dragon position, and in this case could try to get play down the a/b files, but since my king will not be castled over there, I don't fear it. I simply have to protect my pieces down there, and launch a kingside attack as soon as I can.} 6. a3 {I don't think this was accurate by me in this position; there are better things I could do just now, but later I may advance the b pawn up two, depending on how black responds.} Bg7 {The fianchetto. I don't want doubled pawns in this position, so I am going to protect the knight with my queen for a few moves.} 7. Qc2 Ngf6 {This is a good move by black. He's ready to castle, and begin operations. I am still slow to develop because of my less than accurate a pawn move.} 8. Nc3 e6 {So black appears to have the dragon formation fully set up. I am woefully behind in development.} 9. d3 a6 {This move by black prevents Nb5, eyeing d6 and threatening the rook/king fork. In this position it's easily defended, so that was not even in my thoughts. Black is going to castle kingside now, so I need to castle and launch an attack before he does.} 10. Bg5 {First, I pin the knight.} Qc7 {And black unpins his knight with this queen move. There are potential tactics now involving the black knight coming to g4...} 11. O-O {But with the white bishops off the board, if I had to chase it away with h3, I would not feel uncomfortable doing that. Black here could have forced things on his kingside specifically my dark-squared bishop, but had other ideas.} O-O {Now all my potential attack is pointed at the kingside. But had he castled queenside, I could have immediately pushed that b pawn thanks to my a pawn move earlier. Then, it would have been interesting to see whose attack hit first... But since he castled kingside, he'll have to weather a storm for a while.} 12. Qd2 {I want to remove the black bishop and avoid a counter in the center with my queen on c2, as d5 is really contested right now. Black could have chased my bishop away earlier, but now it's too late to do that.} Rad8 {Indirectly x-raying the white queen, again with thoughts of a counter in the middle. But no time for black to do so; I give him his first real choice of the game:} 13. Bh6 Nb6 {Black is still intent on his thrust in the middle, and taking with his bishop can be dangerous. So I interrupt his plans a little by my own plan to weaken the dark squares around his king.} 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. h4 {And immediately launch the pawn! H pawns can cause all kinds of headaches. In this kind of position, the h pawn can cause havoc, and the defensive liability to the white king is not yet critical.} h5 {So far, phase one of my plan has succeeded. The dark squares around the black king are very weak now, and soon I'll be moving my queen and continuing with the rest of my plans. Very soon, as the white knight no longer needs a defender other than the b pawn for now and the white queen is still vulnerable to a thrust in the center.} 16. Rae1 {This is to get my a file rook in the game, and threaten the e pawn advance. I am ready to counter d5 now, despite my queen's rather tenous position, being eyed by the black rook. I probably should have moved my queen first to e2, then position the rook, but after ...d5 I have e5 then ...Ng4 I have Qe2 and things open up with an uncertain position.} e5 {This surprised me, really. I thought d5 was going to come, as he seemed all set up to do that. But I guess he didn't like what he saw... however, now his plans of counter play in the center or queenside are rather nil, and black's position is really cramped, all because of this pawn move. he could later try f5, but he's no where ready to yet. After some thought, I might even be tempted to say this black move deserves a ?, because now his game can't really get untracked.} 17. Nh2 {I am taking a little chance now. I want to crack the kingside open, and to do it I need to support the action with my knight. With the middle tied up, black will have to counter on the kingside, perhaps with f5 as I mentioned; but he can't for a bit. In fact, all avenues for black counter play are currently blocked by his own knights, and his other pieces are not coordinated well towards a plan. Meanwhile, I have two plans I am considering: g4 or f4, depending. Opening up that Kingside!} Qe7 {This is to prevent the white queen  moving to g5. I do it anyway. I don't need my queen to infiltrate the black position.} 18. Qg5 Rfe8 {And now black is ready to move the black knight.} 19. g4 {But not before I get in g4. F4 would have been better here; g4 is a mistake by me.} Nh7 {Well so the queens must come off. Forced, in this position. Much better for black was Nxg4, winning a pawn. I got a little lucky here.} 20. Qxe7 Rxe7 21. gxh5 gxh5 {Perhaps we could have some rook exchances on the g file. Chances are still equal here; my attack has nearly run out of steam, but I still have the initiative...} 22. Nf3 Re6 {A reasonable counter.} 23. Kh2 {Preparing Rg1 of course.} Rg6 24. Rfg1 {Since black is slow to bring his other rook to the party, I will either double up my rooks, or cause my f pawn to migrate to the g file. Either way, I should get access to the kingside soon.} Re8 {This felt slow to me. Surely a better move would have been Rg8 for black. Perhaps he wants to bring his f pawn to the g file and hopes I'll take.} 25. Rg3 Ree6 26. Reg1 {I have ideas of moving my knight to g5, just to see if black will take and allow my king access to his h pawn, as I'd retake with the pawn. But he's too good to let me do that. } Rxg3 27. fxg3 {Now my pawns are connected, and I'm ready to see if I can get to his kingside. I think I surprised him a little by taking with the pawn, but it's the right move if I wish to maintain some kind of pressure on the black king.} Rg6 28. Kh3 {Preparing g4.} Nf6 {Preparing Ng4. But I had forseen this position, and moved the obvious:} 29. Nh2 {Nh2! Why the exclamation point? Because from here on in, I will have a passed pawn threat. And black has to stay on the defensive, and soon my other white knight will be rather more powerful than a mere knight!} Ng4 {A good try to blockade the position.} 30. Nxg4 Rxg4 {I wonder if ...hxg4 was better here. The white King could not get past that pawn easily, and the entire kingside may have stayed blockaded. Here black apparently did not want me to get a passed pawn. But it allows something else...} 31. Rf1 {The critical point of the game. Black doesn't see it until his next turn. But even if ...Kg6, after Rf5, what can black do? It's nearly a Zugzwang on the kingside, and if black moves his knight, the white night infiltrates and causes a lot of problems. It looks like a pawn will fall, or after Nd1 and Ne3, the black rook falls if the King is on g6. If black counters with his own knight moves, after the exchanges, white has an extra pawn. If black moves Rg6, after Rf5 and ...Rh6, white has Rg5+ further restricting black, and can switch to the queenside and move b4. Black may be able to try other moves, but this position requires great accuracy by black to prevent white obtaining an advantage.} f6 {That made it easier for white.} 32. Rf5 {With this move, I had two ways to win a pawn; and black saw it a little too late. As I said, Kg6 traps the rook to Nd1 and Ne3 and ultimately white gets a passed pawn. After a short think, black sort of throws in the towel...} Rg6 33. Rxh5 Nd7 {This defends f6, but allows Nd5.} 34. Nd5 {Nd5! Well I exclamation pointed it not because it wins, but because it's just a great outpost. ;)} b5 {This was ill advised! I don't think black calculated out my response. Perhaps this was an attempt to distract, but now black loses, because white has a simple tactic to get another passed pawn on the queenside. B5 probably needs a ? or even two of them.} 35. cxb5 axb5 {And...} 36. Nc7 {Nc7! This deserves the exclamation point, obvious or not! The coupe de grace so to speak. Black tries b4...} b4 {I ignore it of course! Perhaps c4 would have been a better try, because then perhaps his own center pawns could have become mobilized too.} 37. a4 {a4!} Nb8 {And with black deciding to try to keep the passed pawn from queening on the queenside, he leaves open a veritable slew of holes in his defense, and play continues for a while, with white taking advantage of them.} 38. Ne8+ {With the threat of two passed pawns on opposite sides of the board, and numerous knight forks upcoming, black's game goes down hill fast, but there was little for him to do at this point anyways.} Kf7 39. Nxd6+ Ke7 40. Nf5+ Kd7 41. Rh7+ {Here I think black was just moving, and had ceased really considering the board, but his game has been lost for a few moves now.} Kc6 {There were no more good moves left to black at this point.} 42. Ne7+ Kb6 43. Nxg6 {And black resigned. A fun game against a Sicilian, albeit probably a little boring, unlike most Sicilians. The push d5 by black would have been a much more interesting game I'm thinking! Thanks for getting this far. Any comments are appreciated.}
