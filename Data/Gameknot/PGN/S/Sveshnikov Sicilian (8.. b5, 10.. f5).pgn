1. e4 c5 {Part of a series of annotated games where I explore the Sveshnikov Sicillian. See my annotated games list for other examples.} 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 {My favourite Sveshnikov sicilian} 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 f5 {Still relatively mainline} 11. c3 Bg7 12. Bd3 Ne7 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. Nc2 d5 {This is an interesting move. Usually black castles first} 15. exd5 e4 {Leads to sharp play. But black must play actively with his broken kingside pawn structure} 16. Be2 O-O 17. a4 Qg5 {Interesting} 18. O-O f4 {White is ok, but he needs to play accurately. Black is thinking of preparing for the endgame with an advanced e pawn (after the exchange of rooks on the a file)} 19. f3 Bh3 20. Ne1 e3 21. axb5 axb5 22. Rxa8 Rxa8 23. Kh1 {Nice patient move. 23. Bxb5 Rb8 and we enter similar territory to the game} Bd7 24. Qb3 {Loses, but its not obvious. This is a very interesting position. Its worth looking at this position in detail, either playing the moves through on the board or trying to visualise the options, to consider which mating threats are most relevant here. Rather than spoil the fun for the reader, I'll provide comments after move 26} Ra6 25. Bxb5 Rb6 {Not to win the bishop, but to gain a tempo to bring it into the attack on the kingside. Look how blocked white's position is. The advanced black pawns are choking white's defensive plans. Only the white queen and bishop are active, and it will be difficult for them to assist the defence} 26. c4 {Consistent, but missing black's intentions} Qh4 {Subtle. White must not be allowed to free his position. Returning to the position at move 24. The options here for black are: 1) Doubled major pieces (q+r) on h file. But this does not work as the white king can escape via g1. 2) Sacrifice of queen on h2, followed by rook check on h file. This does not work as white king can escape via g1. Its clear that g1 needs to be addressed before black's plans can succeed. There are 2 solutions to this. 1) Make white block g1 himself. This is the plan I choose with 27.. e2. or 2) Use the dark square bishop on d4 to attack this square. The problem with idea 2 is the black pawn blocking the diagonal e3-g1, and maybe the white knight that can play to c2 preventing black's plan.  Of course the knight would be overstretched in this scenario, meaning instead black could double on the g file. I think its important at move 24 to be able to visualise all these options as black. And also the classic idea of white r on g1, black p on e2, followed by ..Qxh2+, Kxh2 Rh6 mate} 27. d6 e2 {I think white must have missed this idea when he played 24. Qb3. Observe that the black queen needed to be on h4, to prevent Rf2 which would allow white to escape} 28. Rg1 {Unfortunately black does not get his chance of a nice mate today (the white d pawn obstructs the black rook)} Qf2 {I liked this move. Planning ..Bd4 followed by mate. Moves like 28.. Bxb5 allows white to escape} 29. Qd3 {Only move} Rxb5 {Or just ..Bd4 immediately. Although in that line white gets the d7 bishop, and I wanted simplification} 30. cxb5 Bd4 31. Qxd4 Qxd4 32. g3 fxg3 33. Rxg3+ Kf8 {White resigns. Black plans .. Qxb7, ..Bxb5, and then some combination of the queen threatening the white knight, the bishop attacking f3, and promotion of the e2 pawn}
