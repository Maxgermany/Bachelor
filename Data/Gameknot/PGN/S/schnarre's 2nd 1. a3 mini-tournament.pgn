1. a3 {Although primarily used for shock value and as a waiting move (sometimes used by players who prefer to play as Black), 1.a3 has other uses; It prevents the Black bishop from coming to b4 (and also discourages it from coming to c5 as White can then hit it with pawn to b4), and the move also sets the foundations for space gaining moves on the queenside with b4 and c4.  Therefore Whites next move, blocking the c-pawn, is a little inconsistant in my opinion.} f5 2. Nc3 {?! Considering that playing his pawn to e4 has been ruled out for now, it is only the c-pawn that can contest control of the d5 square for White ... so probably best not to block its advance.} Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 {I'm surprised 3...e6 or 3...g6 was not played first.  The knight move abandons the option of setting up a Stonewall structure, which I know schnarre plays so well.} 4. d4 e6 5. d5 {! A clever move which generates active piece play.} exd5 6. Nxd5 d6 {Blocking the bishop on f8, but otherwise 7.Bf5 could create problems. } 7. Bg5 Be7 8. Nxf6+ {?! I would prefer 8.Nxe7 giving me the bishop pair.  Admittedly Blacks dark-squared bishop is pretty passive at the moment, but this may not always be the case (particularly in a game with no blocked pawns).  It could also have turned out to be an important defensive piece for Black.} Bxf6 9. Bxf6 Qxf6 {The exchanges have given Black an easier game and White no longer has his lead in development.} 10. e3 {? Bravely offering the b-pawn ...} O-O {But Black prefers to get his king tucked away.  The pawn could have been taken without too much trouble (e.g. 10...Qxb2 11.Bc4 (keeping the black king in the centre is vital if the pawn sac is to be worth anything) 11...Qc3  12.Nd2 Ne5 13.Bb3 c6 follwed by 14...d5 and 15...0-0 and White has no compensation), but safety first cannot be criticised!} 11. c3 {White will not offer it twice!} Ne5 {11...Be6 first, taking control of the vulnerable a2-g8 diagonal is probably better, but the text is not a bad move.  The knight is on a great square here, controlling some important squares (d3 and f4) so White is forced to exchange.} 12. Nxe5 dxe5 {Black has a small advantage because he has more space and control of the centre.} 13. Bc4+ Be6 14. Qb3 Rae8 15. O-O {White is happy to finally be able to castle and connect his rooks, but also worth consideration is 15.Bxe6  Qxe6 16.Qxb7 providing some counterplay.} b6 16. Bxe6+ Rxe6 17. Rae1 {? A strange choice of square for the Rook.  Why not grab the open d-file?!} Kh8 {! The pin had to be broken if Black is to begin any kind of attack.} 18. f4 {? A very loose move, creating multiple weaknesses!  Trying to block the centre with 18.e4 f4 19.f3 may have given better long term chances.} a5 19. fxe5 {? Is this the losing move?  Whites kingside and e-pawn are now very vulnerable indeed.} Qxe5 20. Rf3 f4 {Probably not best objectively (20.Rh6!?), but at least creating some exciting tension (and it does lead to Blacks victory)!  The position is very sharp - the f and e pawns are in a position to take eachother, but unfortunately both are pinned!} 21. e4 {? White seems to crack under the pressure!  21. Ref1 is better; breaking the pin on his e-pawn, but intensifying it on Blacks f-pawn.} g5 {! Here comes trouble for White!} 22. a4 {? A rather pointless move that does not help White much.  22.Qc4, getting the Queen aid the defence would have been more helpful.} g4 23. Rd3 f3 24. Rd2 Qc5+ {24. Rh6 would also have won it.} 25. Rd4 {Losing immediately, but 25.Kh1 would merely delay the inevitable.} f2+ {A pawn fork wins it.  A tidy game by Black.}
