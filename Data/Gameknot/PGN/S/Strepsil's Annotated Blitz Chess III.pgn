1. e3 {I was trying out a new opening, seeing if it was any good, so I played e3.} e5 {He responds with what I would normally play.} 2. c4 {I push up my pawn.} c5 {He mirrors my move.} 3. Nc3 {I push my knight up behind my pawn - like in the Sicilian Defence.} b6 {I don't like moving there, I think it opens up the rook to much.} 4. Be2 {I move out my bishop, preparing for: Nf3 and then O-O.} Ba6 {He opens up his bishop, but not the way i would.} 5. Nf3 {I push out my knight, preparing to castle.} Nc6 {He opens up his knight, but notice that none of his kingside pieces are open.} 6. O-O {I castle.} Nf6 {He opens up his knight, his first kingside piece is out.} 7. d4 {I attack both his pawns with the protection of my knight, two pawns and queen.} cxd4 {He takes my pawn which will soon lead to a lot of trading and taking on d4.} 8. exd4 {I take his pawn.} exd4 {He takes my pawn and now all the pawns in the centre are about to disappear.} 9. Nxd4 {I take the last pawn in the centre.} Nxd4 {He takes my knight with his own.} 10. Qxd4 {Now I have my queen out and deadly, and my two bishops have much space to move around in.} Qc7 {He opens up his own queen.} 11. Re1 {I threaten: Bf3, checking the king and threatening the rook.} Bc5 {He threatens my queen, which delays my threat.} 12. Qh4 {Now I'm also threatening: Bg5, putting pressure on the knight.} O-O {He castles, and my hope of Bf3 evaporates.} 13. Bd3 {Now I'm threatening: Bg5, which means he can't move his knight without checkmate.} Rfe8 {He threatens my rook with his own, challenging me to take his rook.} 14. Rxe8+ {I accept.} Rxe8 {He takes my rook back.} 15. Nd5 {I threaten his queen with knight.} Re1+ {He checks me, which can easily protected by…} 16. Bf1 {…Bf1.} Qb7 {He threatens my knight.} 17. Nxf6+ {I take HIS knight…} gxf6 {…And he takes mine.} 18. Qxf6 {I take the free pawn…} Bxc4 {Blunder: -Mate (15) It's true, I tried to create the puzzle but it said: error, too many possible solutions.} 19. Bh6 {I push up my bishop, and he resigns, almost unstoppable checkmate. :D That was a good game. We were both very attacking but I managed to scrape a win!}
