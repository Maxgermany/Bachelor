[Opening "Vienna gambit (C25)"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 {Pillsbury intends to drive his KBP forward, so he doesn't yet move his KN.} Nc6 {The amateur responds with symmetry, unsure of how to handle Pillsbury's unusual opening.} 3. f4 {In effect, a delayed King's Gambit.} d6 {Declining the gambit, a move that even by a grandmaster leads to equality at best. The proper way to refute the King's Gambit is to accept the Pawn and return it later for a positional advantage.} 4. Nf3 {Now that his KBP is advanced, Pillsbury can develop this Knight.} a6 {A wasted move. The pin was no real threat.} 5. Bc4 {Pointing balefully at the K-side.} Bg4 {Apparently the amateur is unaware of the Legal pitfall.} 6. fxe5 {The junction point. The correct reply is 6... PxP!} Nxe5 {This move loses the game, either quickly or slowly.} 7. Nxe5 {Black can lose slowly by conceding a piece: 7... PxN 8 QxB, and White has a long but easy win with his material advantage.} Bxd1 {Black chooses to die quickly. Mate in 2 follows.} 8. Bxf7+ {Forcing Black's response.} Ke7 {The final gasp.} 9. Nd5# {A classic trap, well executed by Pillsbury.}
