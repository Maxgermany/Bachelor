[Opening "English (A30), symmetrical, hedgehog system"]

1. c4 {Here's a nice miniature for Suba, this game is in the English (same as the last one) but in this game Suba takes the white side.  While I don't think this is anywhere near as fantastic an overall game, it's enjoyable in the simplicty and forceful nature of the attack.  Also Suba's willingness to move his king is quite enjoyable to watch.  Black also spends seven unimpressive turns (out of 15) maneuvering his knight from g8 to d8.} c5 {Sax chooses the symmetrical variation, I see the type of positions that arise from this as quite drawish, but Suba clearly thinks differently.} 2. Nf3 {A natural move.} Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 {I don't like this plan.  When white takes black will have to recapture with his knight which may prove vulnerable.} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 {I don't think black should lash out with ...d5 this early for this reason, the black knight proves a target in the middle of the board and white is happy to gain time knocking it away.} Nb4 {So black's knight has moved for the third time, and it finally has a threat, Nd3 , which would either displace white's king or win the two bishops.} 6. Bc4 {Suba doesn't mind moving his king, he develops quickly and aggresively.} Nd3+ {A fourth move...} 7. Ke2 {The correct square for the king to move to, the dark knight is hit away and black can't exploit the strangely placed king.} Nf4+ {The knight retreats with check, but this only forces the white king to a more comfortable square, and black will have to spend another turn retreating his knight as it's awkwardly placed on the white dark squared bishop's diagonal.} 8. Kf1 {The king is happy to return to the back rank.  While it may prove difficult to connect rooks, for now white's development lead is huge.} Ne6 {Black spends another turn with his knight as it was a target on f4.} 9. Ne5 {White activates his knight, it's very controlling on e5, and as shown in the game, the knight is hard to drive away.  White's got all the fun in this position as black is cramped and undeveloped, his one developed piece is on e6 stopping his other pieces from entering the game.} Qd6 {This attacks the knights but white has no worries there.} 10. f4 {The pawn is safe because black's knight is pinned to the f7 pawn.} Nc6 {Black tries to get white's controlling knight off the board, or at least off his half of it, but white has a simple reply.} 11. Qa4 Ned8 {Seven knight moves, only to find itself on d8, not a happy set of affairs.  Finally the knight leaves the e6 square which only served to slow down black's own development.  The knight may have been a waste of multipe tempo, but it's not so awful on d8 as it gives c6 and f7 some cover- it proves to not be enough, but that's because it's the only decent defender.} 12. d4 {A great move to open up the game, white will have no trouble regaining the material when the pawn is taken, and this opens up desired files for white's pieces.} cxd4 {No choise here, 12...Qxd4 is wrecked by 13.Nb5! forking the queen and, surprisingly a two knight mate with Nc7#.} 13. Nb5 {The knight forks the queen, a potential mating square (c7) and the pawn on d4.} Qb8 {The only square to save the queen and keep c7 covered.} 14. Nxd4 {White happy regains the pawn putting immense pressure on c6.} f6 {This is an awful, weakening move, the best alternative 14... e6 gives away at least a pawn, but this is far, far worse, as white's two targets (c6 and f7) combine in a nice finish to the game.  Try to spot it!} 15. Ndxc6 bxc6 {The knight keeps it's defense over f7.} 16. Bf7+ {And the game comes to an abrupt finish, black is mated!  After 16... Nxf7 17.Qxc6  black has two equally miserable choices, 17... Bd7 18.Qxd7# and 17... Kd7 18.Nxf7 .  I hope you enjoyed this quick convincing miniature, the game is not a masterpiece, but it's fun, and it shows the danger of moving a piece far too much in the opening.  As always if you have any comments, I'd love to hear them.  The next Suba game will be deeper, I promise.}
