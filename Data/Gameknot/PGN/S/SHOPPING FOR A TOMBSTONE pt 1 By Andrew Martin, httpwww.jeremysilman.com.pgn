1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. e4 dxe4 4. f3 exf3 5. Nxf3 c6 {THE ZIEGLER DEFENSE Black makes a useful move and keeps flexible with the Bishop on c8. He's waiting to see what White will do with his Bishop on f1 and react appropriately.   } 6. Bc4 {This is probably the most common move. I recommend a similar development for Black, just a good sensible reply.   } Bf5 {! Next comes ...e7-e6, shutting out the Bishop on c4. Dead easy.   } 7. Ne5 {White can hack around:  7.Qe2 e6 8.Bg5 (8.0-0 Be7 9.Bg5 Nbd7 10.Ne5 Nxe5 11.dxe5 Nd7 12.Bxe7 Qxe7 is comfortable for Black)  8...Be7 9.0-0 Nbd7 10.Rae1 0-0 favors Black, while 7.0-0 e6  (7...Bg6!? 8.Bf4 e6 is also good)  8.Qe1  (8.Be3 Nbd7 9.Qe2 Bd6 10.Rad1 Qc7 gives Black a clear plus)  8...Be7 9.Bg5 Nbd7 10.Qh4 Qb6 11.Kh1 0-0-0 12.Ne5 Bg6 with an obvious advantage. Black just has to exercise reasonable care.  } e6 8. O-O Bg6 {! SOLID AS A ROCK The safest, negating any thought White might have had about Rxf5. Even Sawyer thinks this is good for Black, he says so in his book.  } 9. g4 {Well, this is the type of caveman response one will have to get used to if one plays 5...c6 on a regular basis. White hasn't got a clue how to attack the Black position and lashes out! On second thought, for caveman, substitute desperate!    Another plausible alternative for White is 9.Bg5   PLAUSIBLE, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH!   Black deals with this move comfortably with straightforward development:  9...Nbd7 10.Qe2 Be7 11.Rad1 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd5 13.Bxe7 Qxe7 14.Ne4 Bxe4 15.Qxe4 Qc5+ 16.Rd4 0-0-0 when White has already run out of steam, and Black's advantage is unquestionable, P Sadilek - S Bakker, Vienna Open 2003.   9 Bg5 only seems to help Black in his quest to exchange pieces.   } Nbd7 {Bricard is very calm. He has seen a long way - to the end of the  game in fact!  } 10. Nxg6 {10.g5 is useless due to 10.Nxe5! 11.dxe5 Qxd1 12.Rxd1 Bc5+ 13.Kg2 Ng4.   } hxg6 11. g5 Qc7 {A novelty that proves to be excellent! Why shouldn't Black have some fun? However, 11...Nd5 may also be good:   12.Qf3 Qe7 13.Bxd5 exd5 14.Bd2 0-0-0 15.Qxf7 Qb4 16.Qf2 Qxb2 17.Rab1 Qxc2 18.Nxd5 Qe4 19.Nf4 Bd6 20.Rbe1 Qf5 21.Qg2 Rh4 22.Ne2 Qd3 23.Bf4 Bxf4 24.Rxf4 Rxf4 25.Nxf4 Qxd4+ 26.Qf2 Ne5 27.Qxd4 Rxd4 28.Ne6 Nf3+ 29.Kf2 Nxe1 30.Nxd4 Nd3+ 31.Ke3 Nc5 32.Nf3 Kd8 33.Kd4 Ne6+ 34.Ke5 Ke7 35.h4 Nd8 36.Nd2 Nf7+ 37.Kf4 Ke6 38.Ne4 b6 39.Ng3 Nd6 40.Ne2 Nf5 41.Kg4 Ke5 42.Nf4 Nxh4 43.Nd3+ Ke4 44.Nb4 c5 45.Nc6 Nf5 46.Nxa7 c4 47.Nb5 Kd3, 0-1, M Hartwig - C Michna, Germany 1996.   } 12. Bf4 {12.Qe2 Bd6! 13.gxf6 Bxh2+ 14.Kh1 Be5+ 15.Kg1 Bxd4+ 16.Kg2 Rh2+ 17.Kf3 Rh3+ 18.Kg4 Qg3 mate. BLACK GOT A CRUSHING ATTACK FOR WHITEâ€™S PAWN A rum turn.  } Bd6 13. gxf6 {Psychological collapse. I suppose at the beginning Rodriguez thought that HE would be the one on the attack. Cold analysis reveals the shocking state of White's position: 13.Bxd6 Qxd6 14.Rf2 Nh7 15.Ne4 Qe7 16.Qd2 f5 17.gxf6 gxf6 followed by .0-0-0 and 13.Qd2 Ng4 14.Ne4 Bxf4 15.Qxf4 Qxf4 16.Rxf4 Ne3! 17.Bb3 Nf5 18.c3 Ke7 are both awful for White.   } Bxf4 14. fxg7 Be3+ {0-1.    The Blackmar-Diemer has to be treated with respect. If you play carelessly or without respect the open lines and quick development that White gets for his pawn will cut you to pieces. But don't be AFRAID or OVERCAUTIOUS because that is where you will fall down. Take the pawn, develop coherently and, like Bricard, look for the counterattacking opportunity that will surely come.  }
