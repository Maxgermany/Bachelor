1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 {The starting point of the Accelerated Dragon.} 5. c4 {I opt for a Mar√≥czy Bind, which takes control of the d5 square and pretty much prevents the d7-d5 move that black hopes for in the Accelerated Dragon.} Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be2 d6 9. O-O {This all seems normal up to now.} Bd7 10. f3 Nxd4 11. Bxd4 Nh5 {I do not think this was a wise move, trading the g7 bishop with that kind of pawn formation can be detrimental to king safety.} 12. Bxg7 Nxg7 13. Kh1 {I guess I did this to prevent any surprise forks/double attacks with check, maybe I was thinking of a possible pawn storm.} Bc6 14. Qd2 f5 15. Qh6 {Getting my queen into an aggressive square.} e6 16. Rfd1 {I like my position up until now.} Qe7 17. Rd3 {Planning to double rooks on this file and control the center.} Nh5 {Not sure what this was for.} 18. exf5 Qh4 {I guess Nh5 was to prepare this move.} 19. Kg1 {Preventing a discovered attack which would end up in the loss of my queen.} exf5 20. Rxd6 {And I'm a pawn ahead. I like my position to be honest. A pawn ahead, my rook is on an open (central) file, my queen is on an aggressive square, and my king is safe.} Rad8 {Offers the rook for control of the file. Here, I have several options. I can retreat my queen to d2, I can place my other rook on the same file and put some use to it, and I can trade rooks in order to simplify since I'm ahead in material. I like retreating my queen to d2 or placing the other rook on the same file the best. Trading rooks here might seem to favor the side that's ahead on material, but I think that giving him that open file might be a bad idea.} 21. c5 {So I chose c5. Let me explain. I defend my rook, while at the same time opening the possibility for my e2 bishop to check his king and put him in a precarious position. What I failed to notice is that I cannot actually check his king since his queen would take my bishop, and that I've just given the pawn back due to a tactic. But if he took the pawn back, I'd be able to get my bishop where I had planned.} Rxd6 22. cxd6 Qd4+ {And here's the tactic.} 23. Kf1 Qxd6 24. Bc4+ {This is what I had planned, but now what?} Kh8 25. Re1 {I did this to try to place my rook on e6 after and possibly distract the queen from it's defence of f8.} Qc5 {He attacks my bishop.} 26. Bb3 {I retreat to a safe square.} f4 {This is a blunder. How do I capitalize?} 27. Re5 {There we go. He can't take the rook because he'd get mated in 1 by way of Qxf8, so now he must move to a square where he defends the rook on f8. There's only two options. Qd6 and Qb4.} Qd6 {He chose Qd6.} 28. Ne4 {And I chose to blunder right back, with the idea of sending my knight to g5 afterwards and attacking his king. The problem is that I had a move that would win a piece, attack his king, and kept my king pretty safe. I should have followed up the first brilliant tactic with another brilliant tactic. I should have played 28. Rxh5. The g pawn was pinned to the queen, so he couldn't take the rook unless he wanted to lose the queen. And his queen was defending the f8 rook, so even if he checked me, he would have had to find a way for him to defend both the mate on h7 and the mate on Qxf8 after the check, and even if he could, I would be a piece ahead. I think 28. Rxh5 would have won instantly.} Qd3+ {And now will follow a myriad of checks until he wins a pawn and gets tired of checking my king.} 29. Kg1 Qb1+ 30. Kf2 Qxb2+ {Wins the pawn and now is a pawn up.} 31. Ke1 Qc1+ 32. Ke2 Qe3+ 33. Kf1 Qd3+ 34. Ke1 Rd8 {And now I do not like my king safety. } 35. Rxh5 {I looked at this move a bit too late, and a bit erroneously as well. I thought he couldn't take the rook because of Qf6#, but he surprised me with another check which defended the f6 square and allowed him to win the exchange.} Qb1+ 36. Ke2 Qb2+ 37. Ke1 gxh5 {This was starting to look quite grim for me.} 38. Qxf4 {I take the f pawn since doubled pawns are easier to attack. I was thinking that I could still pull a victory out somehow, but the next move was pretty forcing.} Bb5 39. Qf6+ {I believe I was forced to do this, or else I'd lose a lot of material, or get checkmated, or get into a really uncomfortable position after 39. Qe3. So I chose to trade queens, hoping that his doubled pawns on the h file will be a target and I'll find a way to draw the game.} Qxf6 40. Nxf6 h4 {Protects his pawn.} 41. Ne4 {I was planning some weird knight moves to win the h4 pawn. Maybe I should have focused more on advancing my kingside pawn majority.} a5 {Now he began to get his queenside pawns rolling.} 42. Nc3 {Attacking the bishop. Only 3 more knight moves away from attacking the h4 pawn. Might have been a bit too hopeful for that. Forgetting that his queenside pawn majority could be my downfall.} Bc6 43. Ke2 {Trying to get my king involved.} b5 44. a3 {I'm not sure that this was the right way to proceed. Maybe I could have played a4. Suggestions?} b4 45. axb4 axb4 46. Ne4 Bb5+ 47. Ke1 {I can't go up as I'd like to because of Rd3+, winning my bishop, and the game.} Rd3 {He goes to d3 anyway, only in this case I don't lose a piece.} 48. Bc2 Ra3 {Preparing an advance to b3.} 49. Nd2 {Preventing the immediate advance.} Kg7 {Finally bringing his king out of inactivity.} 50. Nb1 {Perhaps I should have tried g3 here. This move allows the advance of the pawn after a useful check on e3.} Re3+ 51. Kd1 {If Kf2 I lose a piece, if Kd2 I lose the g pawn.} b3 52. Be4 {Saving the bishop and limiting the rook's movement.} h6 {I suppose he wanted to move his king without losing that pawn.} 53. Nd2 Ba4 54. Nb1 Bb5 55. g3 {I finally play g3, not sure if it was too late.} hxg3 56. hxg3 Kf6 {His king is getting closer.} 57. Kd2 Re2+ 58. Kd1 Ra2 59. Nc3 Ra1+ 60. Kd2 Bc4 61. Ke3 {Trying to get my king involved somehow.} b2 62. Bb1 {And this is the final, decisive blunder. Try to find the next move for black. I should have played Kd2, but maybe that would have lost as well.} Ba2 63. Bxa2 Rxa2 64. Nb1 Ra1 65. Nd2 b1=Q 66. Nxb1 Rxb1 {And here it is clear that I cannot win.} 67. f4 {The next few moves I played quickly and without much thought.} Kf5 68. Kf3 Rb3+ 69. Kg2 {And I surrendered. His king was going to g4 next, winning my final two pawns, and relinquishing all my hopes.}
