1. d4 d5 2. c4 {Queen's gambit.} dxc4 {Accepted.} 3. Nc3 c6 {Wanting to protect the pawn via b5.} 4. a4 {Stops the pawn from being protected.} Nf6 5. e4 {Threatens the pawn.} Be6 {Protects.} 6. Nf3 g6 {The bishop on f8 is restricted to open up via e7, so he must open up on the flank.} 7. Ng5 {Threatening the pawn's protecter.} a6 8. Nxe6 fxe6 9. Bxc4 {Takes the pawn, threatening the pawn on e6.} Qc8 10. O-O Bg7 {Wanting to stop swap one of the doubled pawns, black sees that if he moves the knight our of the way he can play e5, but that wastes three moves including this one.} 11. Be3 Nh5 12. b3 e5 {The plan worked.} 13. dxe5 {Accepts the swap.} Bxe5 14. Qd2 Qd7 {Wanting Qxd7 Nxd7, and then the knight is unprotected.} 15. Qc2 {The queen retreats, till protecting the knight.} b5 16. axb5 cxb5 {Threatening the bishop.} 17. Bd5 {Threatening the rook.} Nc6 18. Ra2 {Out of the pin.} b4 {Blunder. } 19. Na4 {The knight threatens b6, and moving the knight gives the black knight on c6 a double threat, which then leads to pinning the queen or forking the rook. At this point, black resigned, but this is what could've happened.} Qd6 20. Bxc6+ {Now, the rook and king are forked, the queen could be sacrificed, but that would be stupid.} Kf8 21. Bxa8 {Or, instead of Qd6, the rook could've moved, and then Bxc6, winning the queen. Thanks for reading my fifth SO vs. SOE.}
