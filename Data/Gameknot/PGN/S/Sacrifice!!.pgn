1. e4 a6 2. d4 {Might as well take the center if he's going to start that way...} b5 3. Nf3 Bb7 4. Nc3 {I have complete control!!!} Nf6 {4...b4 was the right move.} 5. e5 Nd5 6. Nxd5 Bxd5 7. Bd3 e6 8. O-O c5 9. a4 {I'm not going to let him attack the flank without me also attacking the flank.} bxa4 10. Rxa4 Bc6 11. Rc4 Bb5 12. Rc3 cxd4 13. Nxd4 Bxd3 14. Bg5 {Here is the first sacrifice I do. I do this hoping to trap his Queen.} Qxg5 15. Rc8+ Ke7 16. f4 Qg6 17. f5 {Here, I offer up exf5 Qxd3.

Nc6+ {A final sacrifice seals in my win.} Nxc6 19. Qd6# {I end the game down 10 points materialy, but up a whole king. ;)}
