1. e4 {First I'd like to warn everyone for my possibly bad language - English isn't my native language after all} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {I've been playing the Dragon for some time now and I quite like it - maybe not the soundest approach, but normally gives healthy counter chances.} 6. Bc4 {Black decides to just develop normally and allow a trasposion to the Yugoslav Attack which normally goes more like 5.f3 Bg7 6.Be3 Nc6 etc, without commiting the King's bishop.} Bg7 7. Be3 O-O {Here black could consider 7...Ng4. There is a win for black in the GK database, but 8.Bb5  Kf8 seemed a bit too commital for my taste. In the game the black king eventually walked to f7, thus freeing the rook. Now white chooses tro transpose to Yugoslav mainline.} 8. f3 Nc6 9. Qd2 Bd7 10. O-O-O {Perfectly normal, altough there are alternatives, most popular seems to be a h-pawn hack. This move has, however, scored better in practise.} Rc8 {10...Qa5 is a sharp but maybe somewhat dubious line.} 11. Bb3 {Common theme - the bishop gets out of the fire to mantain central tension; after 11.h4 Nxd4 white is forced to capture with the queen.} Ne5 12. g4 {This is somewhat uncommon move propably played to prevent ...h5 at some stage. 12.h4 is in my opinion more to the point, as the move g4 can turn out to be unnecessary. 12.Kb1 is a possibility too.} Nc4 {Black pursues to play on the half-open c-file and show that white has lost too much time with the manoeuvre Bf1-c4-b3xc4.  12...b5 might be objectively stronger. Black intends to advance the queenside pawns and start an attack. Nothing deep in planning here, but those races are known to be quite hair-raising.} 13. Bxc4 Rxc4 14. Kb1 {A solid move, preventing ...Qa5 for the time being, owing to the little trick starting with 14...Qa5 15.Nd5.   The game is now reaching the middlegame and both sides need to find a plan to follow. If allowed, white will play h4-h5xg6, Be3-h6xg7, Qh6 and mate on the h-file. In general, there are two kinds of plans that black can adopt. The first is to play the minimum amount of defencive moves on the kingside and take all measures possible to embarrass the white king on the queenside - a common race-situation. The other one is completely ignore whites play and try to find a sac-sac-mate-solution!.  In this position, it seems that black needs to find something more than ...Qc7, ...Rfc8 etc, since whites attack is likely to be quicker. 14...Re8 is one approach, aiming to keep the dark squared bishops on board and maybe prepare ....Qa5. I opted for different solution.} b5 {Highly aggressive, but maybe just acceptable. I don't remember any more what I would have responded in the event of Nxb5 but I do remember that it would have ignited blacks attack. Materialism is out of picture in these situations, so I think it would've been bit dubious to take the pawn.} 15. b3 {Interesting, although all weakening moves should be treated with suspicion. Here I thought for a long time, but the thing is that the rook does not have a good retreat square. So I figured out that the rook would have to go. I have to admit, still, that I had in mind that complications are my only chance to beat a player over 200 elo higher than me. This is bit unhealthy aproach and I think I should try to get over that kind of attitude.} b4 {An exchange sac of a different kind!} 16. bxc4 bxc3 17. Qxc3 Qc7 {So the thing here is that now it is black who has all the direct threats and long term pressure towards the king. Play on the b-file is premature, but it is not a shame to let white take over that file - after all, he has to play Ka1 to achieve that and it makes my bishop quite a threatening piece. White isn't now in form to attack on the kingside but then again, he is an exchenge and a pawn up. My guess is that this position should be somewhat better for white.} 18. Ka1 Rc8 {...Rb8 19.Rb1 is not a way forward.} 19. Rdb1 d5 {I like this move. Either capture is obviously bad but white do have a good in-between-move.} 20. g5 {More or less forced.} Ne8 21. exd5 Nd6 {The knight has obviously improved, as has the bishop, so it has to be said that black has made progress. The loss of the d-pawn is at the moment important, as the c4-pawn is about fall and d5-pawn after that, too. White now tries to roll blakc over whit those pawns, to make as much damage as he can. } 22. c5 Nb5 {Other moves are out of question, owing to 23.c6!} 23. Qd2 {Here white propably should've returned the exchange with Rxb5, with about equal chances. after 23...Bxb5 24.c6!? white has menacing pawn but blacks piece activity may well be enough to keep the balance.} Qxc5 24. Rxb5 {Now white feels obligated to return the exchange, but black could've won it back anyway with, say, 24.Rhe1 Nc3. In that position the c3 knight may be well worth a rook, though.} Bxb5 25. Rc1 Qxd5 {Material equality has been restored. I'm quite convinced that black has the advantage at this point - but my plan to realize it could be somewhat dubious.} 26. c3 {At last breaking the pin.} Bc4 {Black now takes aim to the a2-pawn, trying to tie the white pieces to defend it. There could be a better plan, don't know about that. 26...Bxd4 looks terrible although black can then win a pawn. (Bxd4 Qxf3) I really didn't want white pieces to get unnecessary activity.} 27. f4 {There is a question that what white can do here. It's difficult to suggest any plan here.} Rb8 {Improving the worst placed piece but, this is double-edged. The rook is better on a6 than c8, but allowing check in the back rank forces ...Bf8 which, of course, restricts the bishop. I maybe should have played the calm ...e6, cutting out any f5-ideas, giving the dark-squared bishop alternative diagonal and keeping the tension. } 28. h4 Rb6 29. Rc2 Ra6 {And now I actually started to have time trouble. I saw that the pressure on a2 does cramp white so that I could pick a pawn but I felt strongly that is was a wrong way to proceed - but I simply couldn't come up with a better plan. So I crossed my fingers and went for the pawn.} 30. Rb2 Qh1+ 31. Rb1 Qxh4 32. Rb8+ {White can't live without this check, as the rook on b1 is a tactical liability. For example 32.Nf3?? Bxc3  and 32. Bf2? Qxf4!} Bf8 {So here we see that with that had ...e6 been played, the bishop would at least have some scope and it would have given black some control of the a3-square. Now look at it! It used to be great and see through the whole board but now it is just miserable.} 33. Nb3 {White threatens Qd8 or even Rxf6 Kxf8 Qd8  Kg7 Bd4 } Qh1+ 34. Kb2 Rd6 {Cutting the d-file.} 35. Bd4 {Black lost on time. I was about to move ...Re6 but hadn't the time to analyze 36.Bg7 (Kxg7 37. Qd1 Qg2  38.Ka3 Ra6 39.Kb4 Rb6  was the mainline - black keeps his pawn). I think I won't forgive myself for spoiling a game like this with a blunder like this!  Other possibility that I looked was Qc6 with the idea of Qc7. There was, however, 36.Na5 with complications. I must say that I'm not too happy with myself landing in this position, where white has the better bishop and some activity for the modest price of a pawn. I'd like to have some open analysis for this position, too!}
