1. e4 {Guoco Piano.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 {Questionable but not totally beatable... yet...} 4. Ng5 d5 {The obviously only move.} 5. exd5 Nxd5 {5. ... Na5 is better. This creates major problems for black.} 6. Nxf7 {There's the attack. } Kxf7 7. Qf3+ {Logical.} Ke6 {Here's where black starts to lose the game. Instead of trying desperately to hang on to the piece he has "won" black should just accept that he can't keep it and allow white the piece back. This would even the game out.} 8. Nc3 {Black can't hold the knight for long anyway.} Ncb4 9. d4 {another sacrifice, allowing black the choice between the c and d pawns, or the rook. Black jumps into the trap.} Nxc2+ 10. Kd1 {Black cannot take the rook, or 14. Bxd5 Qxd5 and black loses a queen or is mated.} Nxd4 {The correct move.} 11. Bxd5+ {Kd7 is the only option that doesn't lose.} Ke7 {11. ... Kd7 is the only move that allows black to escape. Ooops. So black is mated in two.} 12. Qf7+ Kd6 13. Ne4# {Black hung himself...}
