1. d4 {The following game was my first round game of the 38th Southern Congress (U1600). This is the second year I have played in this tournament, and I have nothing but good memories from my experiences at the Atlanta Chess Center. As I have the white pieces in round one, I open with my standard 1. d4. } Nf6 {Along with 1...d5 the most popular and solid response to a queen's pawn opening.} 2. Nf3 {I have developed a taste for this move at this point. As a 1. d4 player, I am quite accustomed to reaching most of the standard QGA and QGD positions, and like to develop with a protective move such as this early because I am more than willing to play Qa4  should the need arise to regain the gambit c pawn after 2...d5 3. c4 dxc, and having the Nf3 squelches black ideas of play on my d pawn.} g6 {My opponent opts for a King's Indian set up. I can bet with some degree of certainty that his next 3 moves will be Bb7, 0-0, and d6.} 3. c4 {Natural. White lays a claim on d5 while clearing c3 for the Nb1.} Bg7 {For black, the dark squared bishop is one of the most powerful elements of the KID, and it's natural home is on the long diagonal.} 4. Nc3 {As black is giving me all the time in the world to load up in the center, I do so. The main danger for white is that black is preparing a very potent counterpunch once the opening phase ends, as the KID is a very versatile defense (Fischer used it a LOT).} O-O {Black secures his king rapidly, and prepares to develop his queenside.} 5. e4 {Staying with the "book" I continue to exert influence in the center with strong developing moves.} d6 {Black has a "book" as well, and clears a line for his Bc8 while setting up a solid defensive position in the center. This whole opening so far is the classical line of the King's Indian Defense.} 6. Be2 {Standard play by white as well. Both sides now have excellent chances of reaching the middlegame fully developed, castled, and with fighting chances. } Re8 {?! Black takes the first step off of the page by making this move. 6...e5 is the classical continuation. I suppose he was anticipating a big blast through the center, and wanted to support it. } 7. O-O {Sticking with the classical plan.} a6 {? This move totally lost me. I have no idea what my opponent was trying to accomplish here. I was sure he would have played e5 here. I consider this move a tempo loser.} 8. h3 {I felt that since I had the free tempo I would restrict my opponent's light squared bishop, thereby keeping my Nf3 free to explore. } Bd7 {Black again declines playing e5. I'm beginning to wonder if he is some sort of KID genius and I'm severely overestimating my position. I realize that at this point that if I can push d5 should he ever play e5 I will have severley crippled his developing chances.} 9. Be3 {Last piece developed.} e5 {Black finally puts a move on the center. The delay in playing this move is about to get punished however.} 10. d5 {Taking c6 away from black's Nb8, freeing up a lane for my Be3, and weakening my opponent's strong Bg7. A very multi-purpose move.} Nh5 {I guess black was hoping to launch f5 or perhaps play Nf4.} 11. Qd2 {Connecting the white rooks and double tapping the f4 square.} Bh8 {? I got the feeling that black was really playing off of his heels here. My best guess was that he feared g4 and wanted to create an escape square for his Nh5. One of the main strengths of black's position in the KID is his strong castled position, and my opponent is voluntarily weakening it for me.} 12. Ng5 {As white's pieces are coordinating for an assault on the enemy king, I play Ng5 with malicious intent. I am now seeking sacrifice opportunities to further strip my opponent's defenses. I feel that it is fairly safe to entertain these ideas as black is underdeveloped and his pieces are not nearly as coordinated as mine.} Ng7 {Now I am convinced that black intends to play f5 to free up his position. So.......} 13. f4 {......I shoot to open up the f file first while giving my opponent yet another skirmish to consider.} f6 {? Black must really fear my Ng5. I was convinced he would play exf or f5 here.} 14. f5 {! I loved this move. I'm basically daring black to play 14...fxN so I can respond 15. Bxg which hits his queen and drives her to c8 where she cannot get over to defend her monarch. This move also threatens to open up the f file unopposed with the bonus of further stripping black's position.} gxf5 {Black obviously sees the danger of taking out my knight, and gets what he can. The main problem with that idea is that he is helping me accomplish my goal of depleting his defensive presence around his king.} 15. exf5 {Regaining equality, maintaining the "gambit" Ng5, and opening up e4 for my Nc3 to hop to.} Nxf5 {Black once again fights for some sort of initiative by picking up the f pawn. He is trying valiantly to thwart my attack and get his pieces into the game.} 16. Bd3 {! Another move that just made the mad scientist inside of me cackle to himself. Black's Nf5 is now pinned to the h pawn, and the real estate around the black king is WAAAAY below market value. } Nxe3 {Black's kamakaze knight just ran out of steam. 16...fxN STILL presents black the problem it did back at move 12. Time for the fun to begin.} 17. Bxh7+ {A very pretty check, as the bishop is being supported by the knight en prise. Black's castled position is now crumbling move by move.} Kg7 {I had anticipated 17...Kf8, but I guess my opponent feared the f file as I owned it.} 18. Qxe3 {Regaining the piece and looking to get to g6.} Rf8 {18...fxN 19. Qe4 and black tiptoes through the minefield of light squares.} 19. Qe4 {Staying on the light squares while protecting the Bh7.} f5 {Trying desperately to repel the invader.} 20. Qh4 {Protects both pieces and now seeks a violent check once the Bh7 is moved.} Rf6 {Black scrambles to protect his king from the front.} 21. Bxf5 {h7 is now fully in play and any exchanges on the f file will be won by white.} Rh6 {Last ditch effort.} 22. Ne6+ {! and black resigned as capturing the offending knight drops his queen. While my results at the 38th Southern Congress weren't spectacular (2.5/5 with one win, 1 draw, two losses and a full point bye) I was very pleased with my play in this game. The idea of 14. f5 leaving a piece en prise for so long was the sort of tactic that so rarely comes my way. My opponent was very gracious in defeat, and we discussed the game afterwards. It was agreed that his lack of proper development after such a strong opening was the determining factor in this game. Notice that his Ra8, Nb8, and queen never left their original squares. Many thanks to Marshall J. for the game, and I hope you have enjoyed it:) - Thomas   *(2-5-10)* - Today I found out that Marshall has passed away. RIP my friend. You were a class act.}
