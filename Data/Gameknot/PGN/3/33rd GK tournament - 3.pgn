1. e4 {With an unknown opponent I usually play e4. Must be the influence of Fischer...} e5 {I am happy he avoids the Sicilian, as I don't see it very often, and don't feel as comfortable in it as I do ...e5.} 2. Nf3 {The almost-required move.} Nc6 {And the most common reply.} 3. d4 {Here white has a myriad of choices, but I like to play the Scotch, if given the chance.} Bd6 {3...exd4 is the only move that keeps black equal, so this is a poor choice. Why is it bad? Although it does develop a piece, the bishop is misplaced on d6, and will have to move again to free the d-pawn. Black is already seriously cramped.} 4. d5 {Black was probably hoping for dxe5 when the exchanges relieve his cramped space. Of course, I don't want to solve his problems for him, so I push rather than take. Not only does this avoid the exchanges, but it gains space in the center with tempo against the knight.} Nce7 {And black's lack of space continues. Now there is no place for the queen to develop to, except maybe c7.} 5. Nc3 {Simply continuing with development: knights before bishops.} a6 {A wasted move. The c3-knight is never going to b5 anyway, and this flank move ignores the center where the game is normally played.} 6. Be2 {Preparing to castle short, as the center pawns point to the black queenside. It is normal to attack in the direction one's center pawns point.} Nf6 {Black also prepares to castle short, as it will take too much time to get all the pieces out of the way to castle long.} 7. Bg5 {And I change my mind. Or at least, open my mind to the thought of castling long and pawn storming his kingside. I have a big advantage in both time and space, so an attack seems warranted.} Ng6 {And instead of developing a new piece, he moves the same piece for the third time in the opening. That is a violation of opening principles that will be punished.} 8. g3 {Of course I avoid the exchange on f6, as trading pieces reduces the influence of my space advantage. The side with more space should only trade in order to gain some other type of advantage instead. The text move does three things. First, it commits me to castling long and attacking his kingside with pawns. Second, it takes squares away from the g6-knight. Third, it prepares h4, as the pawn storm begins.} h6 {Putting the question to the bishop: what are your intentions? But in light of the coming pawn storm, this move is actually a weakening, as it gives me a target to shoot for.} 9. Be3 {And of course I don't trade on f6. This is a great square for the bishop, as he will support the pawns moving down the board.} O-O {Castling "into it". But what choice did he have?} 10. Qd2 {The final preparation for castling. I still have the lead in development and an advantage in space. Only 10 moves into the game and black is in serious trouble.} Be7 {And he continues to ignore development of his queenside pieces. Maybe he thought this was a valuable defensive move to help protect his kingside, but getting his last two pieces into the game would have been more valuable.} 11. O-O-O {And it is done. My king is safely tucked away and most of my pieces are pointing directly at the enemy king. Commence attack!} Ng4 {Maybe looking to trade off the bishop on e3? Better would still have been to develop.} 12. h4 {And they're off! Already the g6-knight is looking for a safe square. And having trouble finding one.} b6 {Finally black decides to get his light bishop in the game. The problem is that on b7, the bishop will be "biting on granite" as the e4 and d5 pawns shut down the long diagonal.} 13. h5 {It is important in a pawn storm to gain tempii with attacks on pieces.} Nh8 {The only square, but what a sad piece that knight is.} 14. Nh2 {Normally I would not offer to trade pieces, but in this case I get compensation in the form of an uncovered path for my f and g pawns.} Nxh2 15. Rxh2 {Now this rook can go to g2 to help double on the g-file, since the h-file is temporarily shut down.} f6 {Another weaking of the king's pawn cover - just the thing he shouldn't want to do.} 16. g4 {And the attack continues.} Bb4 {Not sure what the point of this is, as the light bishop has gotten ignored again, but I am fine with an exchange on c3. The knight wasn't really participating in the attack yet anyway.} 17. Rg1 {Another rule of thumb for pawn storms is to put rooks behind the pawns. As soon as the white pawns start to open lines by trading off black's pawns, these rooks will spring to life in powerful ways.} Bxc3 {And he does trade. Ho-hum.} 18. Qxc3 {I flirted with the idea of bxc3 to keep the queen and bishop battery on the c1-h6 diagonal, but decided I should keep my pawns intact and just spend a move to put the queen back if I wanted to later.} c5 {In opposite-side castling, it is common for both sides to pawn storm, and often the game is decided by which side "gets there first". Obviously black is not going down without a fight, so this is a good move. I think black was hoping for me to capture en passant, when he can use the newly opened d-file to access my king position.} 19. f4 {Of course, I leave the center closed and continue the attack on his king. It won't be long now before lines start to get opened and his king starts to become vulnerable to my pieces.} d6 {Possibly preparing to recapture with the d-pawn if I take on e5? But better for black would be capturing with the f-pawn when he controls the newly opened f-file with the f8-rook.} 20. g5 {Which is why I don't take on e5, and instead continue to storm toward the enemy king.} Nf7 {Coming out of hiding to defend the squares g5 and h6.} 21. gxh6 {I considered g6 to force the knight back into the corner, but that would have left the pawns around the black king closed, and the point of a pawn storm is to open lines for attack.} Nxh6 {And with the pin down the g-file, the h6-knight is unprotected.} 22. fxe5 {A fact I take advantage of with the discovery to win a pawn.} Ng4 {Blundering a piece, but the game was already out of hand.} 23. Bxg4 {Taking the freebie cinches the game unless I make a huge blunder of my own. Which is not out of the question, unfortunately.} fxe5 {Getting the pawn back and taking control of the open f-file, but it is too little, too late for black.} 24. Bxc8 {Now that I am up material, I will trade down to a won endgame, unless I get a chance to close out with an attack on the king.} Rxc8 25. h6 {And in order to attack the king, I still need more open lines.} Rf7 {There is no good move for black.} 26. hxg7 {And the last of the king's pawn cover is destroyed. It may not take long now.} Rxg7 27. Rxg7+ {Killing two birds with one stone: removing defenders of the king to open lines for attack, and trading pieces to get closer to a won endgame.} Kxg7 28. Bh6+ {Setting up a little trick: if the king happens to move to the h-file, Bg5 wins the queen with a discovered check. But more importantly, this move clears the third rank so my queen can get involved in the attack too.} Kf7 {Avoiding the trap, but this monarch is in deep trouble.} 29. Qf3+ {For now the mighty white queen enters the attack, and there is precious little cover to run to. Notice that white's d-pawn takes away the e6 square and helps hem in the black king. One of the benefits of advanced central pawns.} Qf6 {No matter where the king goes there are tactics at white's disposal, but interposing the queen here is probably the worst of black's meager choices.} 30. Qh5+ {For now black must give up his queen in order to avoid mate. Here are the lines: A) 30...Qg6 31. Rf1  deflects the king and the black queen hangs to the white queen. B) 30...Ke7 31. Bg5 pins the black queen to the king. C) 30...Kg8 31. Rg2    C1) 31...Q interpose loses the queen   C2) 31...K to h-file 32. Bf4  Qh6 33. Qxh6# In light of this, black resigns. 1-0 A classic example of several common themes: 1. Opposite side castling often leads to pawn storms, and the side whose pawns reach the enemy king first usually wins. 2. Pawns can open lines for attack by trading themselves for enemy pawns. 3. A king without pawn cover is likely to die a quick death.}
