1. d4 {That is 3 connected and passed pawns that white gets on move 49.} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {Nimzo-Indian defence.} 4. Qc2 d5 5. cxd5 {a3 is often played here.} exd5 6. a3 Bd6 7. Bg5 c6 8. e3 Qc7 {Threatens ...bxh2.} 9. Bxf6 {White messes up blacks pawns (at the cost of a bishop for a knight).} gxf6 10. h3 Be6 11. Nf3 Nd7 12. Bd3 {Threatens Bxh7.} h6 13. Nh4 {White has several weak black pawns to target on the kingside.} O-O-O 14. Nf5 Bf8 {Black wants to preserve the bishop, but this move disconnects the black rooks.} 15. O-O-O {White wont castle kingside with a half open g file.} Qa5 16. g4 {White could play Nb5 here (the c6 pawn would be pinned) but it doesn't seem to lead to anything.} Kb8 17. Kd2 {White wants to push queenside pawns, so first the king has to get out of the way (even if the king is moving into a pin).} c5 {Black pushes a queenside pawn.} 18. dxc5 Qxc5 {Black has to capture the c5 pawn with care to avoid a pawn fork from 19 b4.} 19. b4 Qc8 20. Nd4 {White wants to stop the isolated d5 pawn. Otherwise black can push it and swap of a weak black pawn (d5) for a strong white pawn (e3) and at the same time open up play down the d file (where white's king is).} Ne5 21. Rda1 {Protects a3 so that white can play b5. Goodbye bishop.} Nxd3 22. Qxd3 h5 {Black seeks counterplay on the kingside to answer white's queenside threats.} 23. f3 hxg4 24. hxg4 {White hates to open the h file but the alternative (fxg4) is worse. Then black plays ...Bh6 and ...Rhe8 to pile pressure on e3.} Bg7 {Re-connecting the rooks.} 25. b5 Rh6 26. Rac1 {Pointless move.  Better is a4.} Rxh1 27. Rxh1 Rh8 28. Rxh8 {Rh7 doesn't work for white because black can play ...Qg8.} Qxh8 29. Nce2 Qc8 30. a4 {Still pushing queenside pawns.} Qc4 {Bad move. This allows white to gain a pawn with no compensation for black. After the c4 (now on d5) pawn is gone white has winning chances and black doesn't.} 31. Qxc4 dxc4 32. Nxe6 {Removing the guard of c4.} fxe6 33. Nd4 {No hurry to take the c4 pawn. First white gets the knight to a better post.} e5 34. Nf5 Bf8 35. Kc3 Kc7 36. Kxc4 Kb6 37. e4 {Vacating a square for the knight.} Ka5 38. Kb3 {Annoying for white (the need to protect the a4 pawn).} Kb6 {Why leave? Better to make white do the hard work. After all it is only white that has real winning chances. So black should try ...Bc5 instead of the text. Then white would try knight g7-e8-c7-d5-c3 and only then could the white king progress.} 39. Ne3 {Now white's knight will make a series of threats against black. The first one is 40 Nd5+ winning the f6 pawn.} Bg7 {Protects f6 safely (not ...Be7?).} 40. Nd5+ Kc5 41. Kc3 {Shutting out the black king.} a5 {Pointless. Now the black king can never go back to a5 to harass the a4 pawn.} 42. Nc7 {Threat is 43 Ne6+ winning the bishop.} Bh6 43. Ne6+ Kd6 44. Nd8 {Threats are 45 Nxb7 or 45 Nf7+ (winning the bishop). So black has to play ...} Kc7 45. Nf7 Be3 {Giving white a tempo to advance the king.} 46. Kc4 b6 47. Kd5 {And again advancing the king.} Kd7 {Shutting out the white king.} 48. Nxe5+ {But white can now afford to sacrifice the knight for two pawns (because of the good placement of the white king) and so win the game.} fxe5 49. Kxe5 {White has unstoppable pawns well supported by the king. Black has no counter threats.} Bf2 50. g5 Ke7 51. g6 Bh4 52. f4 Bf6+ 53. Kd5 Bc3 {White can attack the b6 pawn if necessary. } 54. e5 Kf8 55. f5 Kg7 56. Kd6 {The king heads for d7.} Bb4+ 57. Kd7 Bc5 58. e6 Kf6 59. g7 Kxg7 60. e7 {}
