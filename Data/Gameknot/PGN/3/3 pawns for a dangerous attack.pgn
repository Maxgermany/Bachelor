1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {The Najdorf opening... very common on gameknot it seems, I've had quite a few games with this opening already. Very difficult to understand everything though, so I'm following the main line as long as possible.} 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 {Still main line} Qb6 8. Qd2 {The poisoned pawn variation... still had this position in a few games. White sacrifies the pawn on b2 to have a strong attack. White's pieces are better developped for this pawn} Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. e5 {quite aggressive move... I knew the move f5 already, but by looking at the database, I saw that this move shows quite good results for white. And since I prefer to have a very active and tactical play, I decided to try it out.} dxe5 11. fxe5 Nfd7 {That's how far the book line goes according to gameknot analyzer.} 12. Ne4 {!? Another pawn (in fact, 2) is sacrified for more pressure against the black king. Gameknot analyzer jumps to -1.50 ;-). (I think this position might really be too complicated, even for a computer analyzer).} h6 {Chasing the Bishop away} 13. Bh4 {keeping it in the d8-h4 diagonal, keeps up the pressure.} Qxa2 {2 pawns behind now} 14. Rd1 {I think here you can see again how much more active the white pieces are. the pawn on e5 is also sacrified, but black has a very hard time defending now.} Qd5 15. Qe3 Qxe5 {3rd pawn ;-)} 16. Be2 {preparing to bring the other rook into play} Bc5 {black prepares too castle and also attacks the strong Nd4} 17. Bg3 Bxd4 18. Rxd4 {pieces exchanged. White still has both bishops which is definitely an advantage in open positions like this.} Qa5+ 19. Rd2 O-O {castling... but the white pieces still look very dangerous.} 20. Bd6 {attacks the rook and makes the bishop control more squares} Re8 {Rd8 seems more common.} 21. O-O {the other rook comes into play too ;-). whites 6 pieces are all developped and have a lot of possibilities to act, while black only has his queen and 1 knight developed. gameknot analyzer still sees black having a better position (-1.74).   I think white has to prove his tactical abilities now ;-).} Nc6 {Develops the knight} 22. Qg3 {To be honest, I played this move by looking at the database (it's the last move that can be found there). But it seems to give a lot of future threats to black} Nd8 {?  I think my opponent wanted to protect the weak f7 pawn. But in my opinion for that he should rather have put his knight to e5, where it would have been more active.  b6 would have been another move to consider, trying to bring the Bc8 into play later} 23. Bc7 {Not sure if this move was good, but it just attacks this knight (and the queen) and puts some pressure on the other side of the board. Also, I had in mind that the knight can be move to d6 later  Blacks Ra8 and Bc8 are completely out of play and even the other pieces (except the queen) have very limited space to move. At this point of the game one of my aims also was not to let black activate those pieces. Beside of finding a good attack, of course ;-)} Qa4 {?!  I think Qb4 was better here, as the queen would still have been aiming at the Rook at d2, which would have sort of 'pinned' my knight (as it's the only piece that protected the rook). Since the gameknot analyzer didn't critisize this move, it was maybe no mistake, but this move had given me the possibility to follow my plan} 24. Nd6 {That's the point, now I could bring my knight to d6, attacking the rook and also aiming at f7} Rf8 {forced} 25. Bxd8 {!?  The plan was simple... if the rook takes the bishop, f7 is lost and the black king is in trouble.} Rxd8 {?  I think this was the losing move. however, the 'correct' way to capture this bishop isn't easy to find, I think. Gameknot analyzer suggests: ...Qb4! 26. Rd3 Qc5+ 27. Kh1 Qe5 28. Qf3 Rxd8 29. Nxf7 Qa5 30. Nxd8 Qxd8. This would give both sides quite equal material (1 rook for 1 bishop + 2 pawns). White should still have an advantage though, because of the active pieces.} 26. Nxf7 {26. Rxf7? would have looked dangerous, but have slowed down the attack a lot after ...g5 I couldn't see any possibility for a good attack.  The capture with the knight though kills blacks defenses.} Re8 {?! This move makes it easy for white, Rf8 was a tougher defense. Now white has a mate in 8. I didn't see it at this point though, but the next move was easy to find anyway.} 27. Nxh6+ {Another defending pawn gone} Kh8 {Kh7 wouldn't have been better...} 28. Qh3 {!? A bit amusing, I still didn't see the mate at this point, and 28. Nf7+ would probably have been easier to achieve it ;-). } Nf6 {looks good, but doesn't help. (note that after ...gxh6 29. Qxh6+ Kg8 30. Qg6+ Kh8 31. Qxe8+ (beside of a mate in 3 more moves ;-) ).   } 29. Nf7+ {here I finally spotted the mate} Kg8 {forced} 30. Qh8+ {!} Kxf7 {forced} 31. Bh5+ {and Black resigned. The bishop can't be taken because the knight is pinned.   (31. ...g6 32. Rxf6+ Ke7 33. Qg7#)  I hope you enjoyed it. Feel free to comment it, especially if you know more about this interesting najdorf variation. (And I apologize for any inaccurate or even wrong comments, as well as for my bad English. Such game situations are probably too complex for me to analyze them better).}
