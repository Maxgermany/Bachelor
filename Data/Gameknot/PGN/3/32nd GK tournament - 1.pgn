[Opening "Scandinavian (centre counter) defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {Here is a really exciting game from the second round of the GameKnot #32 Advanced section. I have been playing in these site-wide tourneys for three years, and always in the Intermediate section. After the first round was completed, I was bumped up to the Advanced section because my rating had increased past the 1500 mark. I knew that I was going to be in a world of hurt, and was just hoping not to get shut out. My dilemma was best characterized by a simple question - Play it safe? Or go for the gold? I opted to get aggressive and slug it out, and was rewarded by a very satisfying attack early on. My opponent and new friend bly_garcia defended extremely well and was able to launch a deadly counter-attack that threatened mate in short order. The endgame was very exciting, with some really cool tactical possibilities for both sides. Down in material, my opponent proved why he is the stronger player, and salvaged a very nice draw. I hope you enjoy the game! } d5 {As white has opted for the most popular first move of 1. e4, I of course respond with my favorite - the Scandinavian. I know, I know....I just can't get away from the Scandi - it's an addiction!} 2. e5 {Advance variation, where white declines the "gambit" pawn and plays to establish a big center.} c5 {Claiming space on the queenside and clamping down on d4.} 3. f4 {?! White announces his intentions of a kingside push very early. This is a risky endeavor if not played correctly, as black's light squared bishop has now become more powerful and the real estate surrounding the white king has been weakened.} Bf5 {With the intentions keeping the light squared bishop outside of the pawn chain after black plays e6.} 4. Qe2 {?! This move confused me a little. I was expecting 4. g4 with tempo as white has already signaled his intention of kingside play. This play does threaten the weak b5 square with check, but it also restricts whites light squared bishop.} a6 {Probably not worthy of an exclamation, but very solid none the less. Black's lowly a pawn now successfully defends the b5 square against whites queen and bishop battery.} 5. d3 {? I considered this move a mistake. While it does open up a line for whites dark squared bishop, it further restricts the queen/bishop line that white just established. Perhaps Nf3 or Nc3 was better.} e6 {As planned. Black can now develop the dark squared bishop while reinforcing the pawn chain on the white squares.} 6. h4 {? White lashes out on the kingside, but with the wrong pawn. Again, 6. g4 with tempo was much stronger. It could then be followed by playing h4. White has now opened up some juicy lines of attack for black on the kingside. At this point, the beginning of some attacking themes started crossing my mind. I felt that the white pawns on the kingside may be vulnerable to attack if I could only develop my pieces in that direction.} Be7 {A developing move which hits the h pawn twice. Notice that from the h4 square black can deliver a check with either the dark squared bishop or the queen.} 7. g3 {White simply defends his weak h pawn. I felt pretty good here, as I had a lead in development and space was roughly equal. As white has opened up space around his king, my plan was to exploit that fact quickly.} h5 {A counter thrust on the kingside which negates the pesky tempo gaining move white would have if allowed to play g4. This play will also support an attack on the enemy queen by putting the light squared bishop on g4.} 8. Bd2 {White hurries to catch up in development. He probably sees the dangers of 0-0, and wants to play 0-0-0.} Bg4 {Posting the bishop nicely and attacking the queen. White must now move her and use time better spent developing.} 9. Qf2 {Best, as this move allows the light squared bishop some developing room.} Nh6 {!? While developing to the edge is not always wise, in this case black sees two potential posts for this knight on either f5 or g4.} 10. Be2 {White correctly assesses that his light squared bishop is weak, and offers it up for exchange.} Bxe2 {Black accepts the deal, as space on g4 will be created for a righteous posting of the knight currently residing on h6.} 11. Qxe2 {White re-takes with the queen, as he wants to develop his Ng1 to the f3 square.} Ng4 {As planned - black claims the strong g4 post. It is worthy noting at this point that while black has the lead in development, BOTH sides are unusually under-developed for a game 11 moves old. I don't see this kind of thing too often, as was a little paranoid. The initial question of "Play it safe? Or get aggressive?" returned to my thoughts. As blacks position is currently stable, I figured getting better developed was probably the smart play. I didn't realize at the time that a very nice attack was about to play out.} 12. Nf3 {As planned. White now has 0-0 available if needed, and a strong piece comes to the defense of the weakened kingside. I'm sure my opponent was working out variations involving the g5 square, as he is hitting it three times now to my two.} Nc6 {Black simply develops, and hopes that white does not force the issue on g5.} 13. c3 {?! This move tortured me. White obviously intends to reinforce his center, but at the expense of a developing square for his Nb8 and some mobility of his Bd2. What's up his sleeve?} b5 {This was actually a "waiting" move, but it does claim some nice space on the queenside and supports the c4 square.} 14. Nh2 {? This was the telling move of the game so far. White hopes to eliminate the solid Ng4, but in doing so opens himself up to.......} Bxh4 {! If 15. NxN then 15...Bxg . If 15. gxB then 15...Qxh . Either way, black can bring some pain to whites weakened position and still come out OK. One of the main reasons of making this play was to prevent white from being able to castle, therefor keeping his king in the middle of the board. Black is hoping for the continuation of 15. gxB Qxh  16. Kf1 Qh3  17. Qg2 Qxd3  with the compensation of three pawns for a bishop and white not being able to castle.} 15. gxh4 {It appears that white is going play along:)} Qxh4+ {As planned.} 16. Kf1 {Obviously 16. Kd1 fails to the strength of 16...Nf2 ! (a nasty fork that loses a rook for white).} Qh3+ {Still part of the plan.} 17. Qg2 {Here was the telling point of my plan. 17. Kg1 could be better defended, but I was hoping white would opt to try to eliminate the dangerous threat of my queen roaming around with impugnity in his back yard. White offers up a queen exchange to extinguish the immediate threats.} Qxd3+ {Obviously declined to maintain material equality, and the attack continues.} 18. Ke1 {I had incorrectly assumed that white would once again offer to exchange queens. He chooses, however, to evade the check and maintain his own threats on my Ng4. I failed to see how dangerous these threats are however, and play.....} O-O-O {....to secure my own king.} 19. Qf3 {? White misses [ 19.NxN hxN 20. RxR RxR 21. Qxg winning a pawn] and once again offers up a queen exchange.} Qxf3 {Black sees the opportunity white just missed, and opts to end this particular skirmish satisfied with achieving the initial goal of preventing white from castling and keeping his king in the center of the board - hopefully vulnerable to a future attack.} 20. Nxf3 {Naturally.} f6 {As the smoke clears from that last skirmish, I opt to instigate another. Realizing that I have basically exchanged a bishop for three pawns, I intend to use this pawn advantage to remove his e and f pawns, which will clear files for my rooks to attack on.} 21. exf6 {As black is hitting e5 three times to whites two, white must take to maintain material.} gxf6 {Not 21...Nxf, as the pressure on e5 must be maintained.} 22. b4 {White lashes out on the queenside, hoping for 22...cxb 23. cxb which will open up c3 for his knight and also clear some room for his Bd2 to operate on, as well as opening up a clear avenue on blacks exposed king.} c4 {Closing off the c3 square for white to develop on, and creating a nice pawn wedge on the white squares.} 23. a4 {! Good move. white intends to bring his Ra1 into play down the a file. Black must shift his forces to the queenside to defend, and white hopes to pick up the h pawn in the process.} Kb7 {Clearing the 8th rank for rook mobility.} 24. axb5 {! Another good move. White achieves his goal of owning the a file by forcing black to open it up for him by re-taking to maintain equality.} axb5 {Practically forced. Black is still solid, but now must contend with the new found mobility of whites Ra1.} 25. Na3 {! That's three strong moves in row for white - he is getting back into the game. White threatens to take out the black pawn on b5. If black protects it by 25...Kb6, then white can simply re-develop the knight to c2. If black chooses the more aggressive 25...Ra8 pinning the knight, he still just re-develops to c2 to protect his Ra1.} Kb6 {I choose to simply protect the b pawn.} 26. Ke2 {! Interesting. White leaves his knight on the edge, and opens up the 1st rank for his rooks to operate on. I was figuring on Nc2 at the time, but failed to see how this was a much more passive move.} e5 {As my opponent has made several strong moves in a row, I opt to press the issue in the area that I feel I have the advantage, which is with my pawn advantage. I'm hitting e5 three times to his two, so I know he will have to re-take. I'm still planning to center my rooks for an attack down the middle now that the threat of action down the a file is at least temporarily stalled.} 27. fxe5 {Practically forced.} fxe5 {Correct, as I do not want to lose my nice post on g4. Attack on d4 is my next goal.} 28. Be3+ {! Nice move! White throws a mean check that also supports the d4 square. Black must eliminate this bishop, and in the process lose the nice knight posting on g4. White has signalled his intention to eliminate pieces (as he has three to my two) and hopes to use whatever piece he has remaining to pick off my central pawns.} Nxe3 {I hate to keep saying "Practically forced" but I feel that this last move was. It does have the added benefit for black of being a knight-for-bishop exchange. This is going to a very exciting endgame!} 29. Kxe3 {White naturally equalizes, while bringing his king to the support of d4.} d4+ {! Here black puts white to the test. Both sides are hitting d4 three times, so white will come out even should exchanges occur. The problem with that is, however, that whites king will be left extremely vulnerable in the middle of the board, as black will surely start attacking with his rooks.} 30. Kd2 {White sees the dangers just mentioned, and wisely retreats.} dxc3+ {Black opens up the d file with a double check. Note that white cannot re-take. If he does, the very nasty 31...Rd3  wins whites Nf3.} 31. Kc2 {Again, white sees the obvious tactic and evades the check. I'm betting he hoped to exchange rooks via the d file, and head into an endgame of my pawns vs. his pieces.} Nxb4+ {I really liked this move. Since I am a pawn up, I offer to exchange a knight and a pawn for a knight - getting back to even material. I envision 32. Kxc Rd3  33. KxN RxN 34. Nxb c3! with hopes of making him defend against promotion.} 32. Kc1 {Once again, my friend bly_garcia sees this, and sidesteps it nicely. He has, however, broken the connection between his two rooks. I'm wondering how to best take advantage of this fact.} e4 {As I feel that my  2 is only temporary, I opt to start my isolated pawn down the lonely road towards promotion with a tempo move. I have no illusions of it actually promoting, but its threat of doing so will keep my opponent on the defensive.} 33. Ne5 {! Nice. The threat of forking my two rooks must be dealt with immediately.} Rde8 {What better way to defend than to attack. Any check the Ne5 throws my way can simply be evaded, and this rook move to e8 supports the isolani.} 34. Nd7+ {Of course I saw this coming.} Kc7 {Threatening the attacker, but leaving the b pawn vulnerable.} 35. Nf6 {This lone wolf knight is causing all kinds of problems. The pawn on e4 must still be protected, so....} Re5 {! Evading the threat on the rook and reinforcing the weak b and h pawns.} 36. Rb1 {Threatening the Nb4 and putting a wicked X ray on the weak b pawn.} Nd3+ {A time gaining check that will allow the black king the chance to get back to the defense of the b pawn.} 37. Kc2 {White evades the check, and threatens to gobble up the c pawn.} Kc6 {The black king now assumes his role of protector from a square that cannot be checked. Once again, it is decision time for white.......} 38. Rbg1 {! White chooses correctly, and does not take the "free" pawn on c3 as it does not threaten anything and is going nowhere. White intends to wreak havoc on the extremely weak 6th and 7th ranks.} e3 {As protecting the weak 6th and 7th ranks will simply take too much time, I opt to press the one big advantage that I have, which is the supported passed pawn.} 39. Kxc3 {White goes ahead and takes the freebie, and I got a little confused. Was he intending to sac his weak Na3 for my b and c pawns? Or perhaps slide his king to d4 and threaten my Re5? I wasn't going to give him time to decide, so I kept pushing for a new queen.} e2 {White MUST play correctly and prevent my promotion - not only will the scales of material be tipped my way, but also because a new queen will created with a check as well.} 40. Nc2 {White over-protects the queening square while getting this knight back into the fray.} Rf8 {! Giving up hope of the h pawn ever meaning anything and attacking the knight that is camped out in my back yard. The real strength of this move, however, is that it targets f1, where a favorable exchange may be possible.} 41. Rg6 {!! Excellent move! White protects the vulnerable Nf6 while threatening a brutal discovered check. (Note that 41. Nd4  would have been a waste of time, as black could simply evade while maintaing all current threats, and the Nc2 is needed to cover e1).} Kc7 {The only move. White is threatening checks and forks aplenty. I must now find a square for my king that will be safe from any check if I am to have any chance of initiating any offense of my own.} 42. Rg7+ {White keeps up the pressure, and slowly starts cutting off life saving defensive resources for the black king.} Kc8 {Whew....safe for the moment at least. White cannot safely check with his next move.} 43. Nd7 {! But he can fork my rooks! Strong move!} Rf1 {! So I respond with a strong move of my own! Whites Rh1 is now attacked, but more importantly the e1 square is now being hit by black three times to whites two. 44. RxR is awful, as black will simply queen on f1 instead. White must protect his Rh1 and come out of any e1 queening scenario with the raw end of the deal.} 44. Rh2 {White wisely gets out of the way, and I'm sure he hopes to double his rooks on the g file if he can.} e1=Q+ {Game on! Black now wins material, but still has big defensive problems.} 45. Nxe1 {Practically forced.} Rexe1 {Forced on my part to preserve that rook from the threat is was receiving on e5.} 46. Nb6+ {White frees up his attacking position with a tempo check.} Kd8 {Once again, the black king is alone and under fire. I attempt to get him over to the e file where he will have some cover from the Re1.} 47. Rxh5 {! And white threatens mate in 1.} Rec1+ {The question here was whether to play 47...Rf8 to prevent the mate, or to try to find some mating nets of my own. Since I could play Rf8 anyway if my attacking ideas failed, I opted to go on a little king hunt of my own.} 48. Kd4 {White runs for the cover of his pieces.} Rf4+ {It was at this point that I thought a draw my three-fold repetition was possible. I analyzed lines involving the white king making circles around my Nd3. I wasn't sure if I could defend well enough after I played Rf8 and my opponent followed with R5h7, so I kept on checking - hoping that my material advantage would come into play.} 49. Kd5 {Finding a temporarily safe home for his king. 49...Nb4  loses, as his mate in 1 threat is just too great.} Rf8 {Alleviating the immediate mate in 1 threat. White now has time to make the move that I feared most.} 50. Rhh7 {!! White delivers a massive blow! Coupled with the assistance of his Nb6 and his king, white threatens a brutal mate on the 8th rank.} Nf4+ {!! Very strong move for a couple of reasons - It obviously delivers a life saving check that white must address, but much importantly it will clear the d file for blacks Rc1 to assist in the defense of his monarch.} 51. Kc6 {White evades, and puts more heat on d7.} Rd1 {! Black now has a defensive resource. If rooks are exchanged, the black king will have a little breathing room along the 8th rank.} 52. Rgc7 {! My friend bly_garcia sees this, and creates another mate in 1 threat on c8!} Rd6+ {!! If 53. KxR, then 53...Rf6  loses the white knight AND draws the king away from his protection of the Rc7.} 53. Kxb5 {White regains some material while maintaing all threats.} Rxb6+ {! Another strong move. If 54. KxR then 54...Nd5  forking the king and the Rc7} 54. Kxb6 {Black eliminates the kamakazi rook and is rewarded by......} Nd5+ {Per the plan. Black now threatens to exchange his knight for the Rc7 and head into the final stages of the game up a full pawn.} 55. Kb7 {White stubbornly hangs on to his mate threat on c8.} Nxc7 {Of course.} 56. Rxc7 {Of course. At this point, white probably realizes that his attack has failed, but a draw is well in hand.} Rf4 {Being the much weaker player, I don't realize the draw quite yet, and cling to the hopes of my pawn advantage being enough to win.} 57. Rc5 {Getting off of the c7 square which must be protected by king, white effectively cuts off all access to the pawn by the black king. He has two moves to get to b5 and force its demise, and I just can't get to the pawn at all.} Kd7 {Praying for a miracle:)} 58. Kb6 {"No miracles allowed:)"} Kd6 {If white has a brain spasm and checks me I might have a chance!} 59. Kb5 {"No brain spasms either fella:)"} Rd4 {And my draw offer was accepted. In my three years and 1000's of games played here on GameKnot, I put this one in my Top 3 of all time. I'm not sure that I have played a more exciting game on this site. Many thanks to my new friend bly_garcia for giving me such a great battle! I can't say that I will voluntarily move up to the Advanced Section of these GameKnot tournaments, as my nerves will not allow it, but I sure do appreciate the beauty of this jewel, and will remember it for a long, long time! Cheers - Thomas}
