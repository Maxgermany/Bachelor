1. e4 {This is the first game I've ever tried to annotate.  Please feel free to make lots of comments and give suggestions on better moves I could have made.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 c4 {More common is Nc6 to put pressure on d4.} 5. Nf3 b5 6. Be2 Be7 7. O-O h6 8. Bf4 f6 {Weakens black's kingside castle.  Probably dangerous since white is well developed on the kingside.} 9. exf6 Nxf6 10. b3 O-O 11. Nbd2 a5 12. bxc4 bxc4 13. Nh4 g5 {Nice pawn fork here, but I'll get out of it since the knight on b8 was never developed.} 14. Bxb8 {White loses an attacking piece because of the pawn fork, but the knight is pretty strong here as we'll see.} Rxb8 15. Ng6 Rf7 {This was an unfortunate mistake.} 16. Ne5 {White has somewhat of a knight fork here.  Black can move his rook to safety, but white can follow with Nc6 forking the queen and the other rook.} Qc7 {Black opts to save his rook on the open file and put his queen on a diagonal that attacks white's castle, but after 17.Nxf7 Kxf7 the black king is on a dangerous square.} 17. Nxf7 Kxf7 18. Nf3 Nd7 {Keeping white's knight off e5.} 19. Re1 Nf6 {???} 20. Ne5+ Kg7 21. Qc2 {There is no way for black to protect g6.} Bd6 22. Qg6+ Kh8 23. Nf7+ {Wins the black queen!}
