1. e4 {I was playing as black ... In this short game, I put all my focus on moving my forces to attack whites king} e5 {symmetric reply} 2. g3 {I don't like this move as if the goal is to fianchetto the bishop, the g2-b7 diagonal is already blocked by the e4 pawn} Nf6 {attacking the e4 pawn thus gaining an early initiative and gaining more of the center} 3. Nc3 {defending the e4 pawn and developing a piece toward the center} Bc5 {developing the dark-squared bishop to an important diagonal ... especially if white castles king-side} 4. Qf3 {moving the queen too early in the game ... but maybe, white was afraid of Ng4 thus pressuring the f2 pawn and possibly forking queen and rook} d6 {opening lines to the light-squared bishop} 5. Bh3 {trying to catch-up with the development race.} Bxh3 {first bloodshed in the battle ... I cannot afford to lose the initiative and play passively ... I may have played Nb-d7 but this will give him the initiative } 6. Nxh3 {now he has a non-defended knight on edge ... which is not good} Nc6 {developing another piece} 7. O-O {castling king side ... which is fine for me as I placed the dark-squared bishop on c5 for that reason ... it is now when my plan became more clearer ... and the plan is simple ... 1.castle queen-side 2. attack king-side toward whites king} Nd4 {temporarily forking the queen and the c2 pawn ... but most importantly, this move puts my knight on a very attacking place nearer whites king} 8. Qd3 {defending the c2 pawn ... notice the queen moved twice till now, while I spent these two moves on a better placement of my forces} Qd7 {this move helps me both tactically and strategically  Tactically: getting the queen off my first rank while preserving the initiative by attacking the lone knight on h3   Strategically: getting nearer to achieve my plan (1. castle queen-side 2. attack king-side toward whites king)} 9. Kg2 {defending knight at h3 } O-O-O {mission 1 accomplished ... queen-side castle completed.  moving to mission 2. attack king side toward whites king} 10. Ne2 {spending a move to challenge my well-placed knight on d4} Rdg8 {sticking to my plan ... moving the rook to g8 to support a pawn thrust toward whites king. note how all my pieces points out to whites king-side. here I realized that I am going to win this match :-)} 11. Nxd4 {removing an important attacker ... but, who cares} Bxd4 {taking back with the bishop to keep the dark diagonal open} 12. c3 {harrasing the bishop} Bb6 {moving the bishop to a place far from small harrasements, while keeping the diagonal open} 13. f3 {I am not sure of the intent of this move, but I think the aim is to add a defender to the e4 pawn and make some space to the knight on h3 to breath} g5 {starting the pawn thrust} 14. g4 {preventing a further g4} h5 {normal continuation of the pawn thrust ... I want to open lines for my rooks to attack the king} 15. b3 {irrelevant ... the battle is not here} hxg4 {opening lines and attacking the bad knight on h3} 16. fxg4 {removing the attacker} Qxg4+ {check} 17. Kh1 {I think better was Qg3} Rxh3 {taking the kinght and attacking the queen} 18. Rg1 {now the game ends ...} Qxg1# {checkmate ... I hope you enjoyed the game}
