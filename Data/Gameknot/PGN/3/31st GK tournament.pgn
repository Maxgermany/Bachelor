Nxd4 d6 {d5} 6. e4 {Increasing my control of d5} Nxd4 {A suprising move.

Qxd4 g6 {The only way to develop his bishop, due to his pawn on d6.} 8. Be2 Bg7 9. Be3 O-O 10.

Kxc1 Bc3 20. a3 Ba4 {Preventing my King from advancing, but tieing down his Bishops in the process. His king is now stronger then mine, but my Bishops' kingside strength balances that. } 21.

Kc2 {Preventing Bd3 or Bd2} Kf7 40. Be4 Bg3 {Trying to foce a premature pawn advance.} 41.
