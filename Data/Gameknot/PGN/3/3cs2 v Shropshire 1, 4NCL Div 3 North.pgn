1. e4 {My season has been pretty bad so far - 5 draws and 1 loss in the 4NCL. At last I get to win a game!} c5 {I play my trusted Sicilian.} 2. Nf3 {He plays the main line.} d6 {I sometimes also play 2.....Nc6} 3. c3 {Aiming for d2-d4.} Nf6 {Attacking e4.} 4. Bd3 {Defending e4, although there is no danger as 4.....Nxe4 is met with 5. Qa4+ winning the knight on e4. My opponent said afterwards that he should have played 4. h3} Bg4 {Played, before he can get h3 in....} 5. h3 {He attacked my bishop.} Bh5 {I retreated. Probably exchanging on f3 is better. Now I get into an uncomfortable position.} 6. e5 {He advances.} dxe5 {I take.} 7. Qa4+ {He throws in a check, so that he can recapture the pawn on e5.} Nc6 {In the two games in the Gameknot World Database with this position, black played Nb-d7 and won both games, but I didn't like the look of the position after 8. Nxe5} 8. Nxe5 {He takes the pawn.} Qd5 {Defending and attacking.} 9. Nxc6 {He takes.} bxc6 {Of course, if I take with the queen, I lose to 10. Bb5} 10. O-O {I can't take his bishop on d3 as my c6 pawn goes with check, followed by the Ra8.} e6 {So I quietly develop.} 11. Ba6 {Threat 12. Bb7} Rb8 {Easily met.} 12. Na3 {So he develops.} Be7 {So do I.} 13. Re1 {His rook comes to a more active square.} O-O {And I castle at last.} 14. Nc4 {His knight reaches a fine blocking square. There is the threat of 15. Ne5 and if 15.....Rb6 16. Bc4 and my a7 pawn goes.} Nd7 {So I stop that.} 15. Ne3 {Strange move by the knight. It was already placed on its best square on c4.} Qd6 {Queen drops back. I was half expecting 16. Nc4 with a repetition and an early draw.} 16. d3 {He develops.} Rfd8 {So do I.} 17. Nf1 {With a threat of 18. Bf4} e5 {I stop that, but it is a bit weakening. I think now 17....Bf6 was better.} 18. f4 {Attack!} f6 {Defend!} 19. Ng3 {Attack on Bh5} Bg6 {I drop back.} 20. f5 {I didn't mind this at first, as I thought he had taken the pressure off my e pawn, but I soon find he has the wonderful e4 square for his knight.} Nb6 {I hit his queen.} 21. Qg4 {Queen switches to the king-side.} Bf7 {Bishop drops back.} 22. Ne4 {Knight takes up a commanding position.} Qd7 {My queen drops back. 23. Bh6 looks strong now, but I can defend with g7-g6 (but not Bf8?? 24. Nxf6! winning).} 23. Be3 {So he attacks c5 instead.} Nd5 {I open an attack on b2.} 24. b3 {So he prevents that.} Nxe3 {The only way to stop going a pawn down.} 25. Rxe3 {He takes back.} g6 {I threaten Qxf5} 26. Rf1 {He protects, also threatening f5xg6 and a second attack on f6 with his rook.} Kg7 {So protect f6 again. } 27. Rg3 {Another attack on g6.} g5 {So I try to block off the king-side.} 28. Bc4 {He exchanges off my good bishop.} Bxc4 {So off it goes.} 29. dxc4 {He takes back.} Qe8 {and my queen prepares to protect the light squares round my king. He probably has a slight edge here, good knight on e4 v my bad bishop, but I think black should be able to defend. However he now thinks he has a good sacrifice.} 30. Nxg5 {He takes.} fxg5 {I take back.} 31. f6+ {He advances.} Bxf6 {I take.} 32. Rxf6 {He takes back.} Kxf6 {I take.} 33. Qxg5+ {He takes.} Ke6 {My king runs.} 34. Qh6+ {Checks again.} Kd7 {I run again.} 35. Rg7+ {Check again.} Kc8 {My king runs again. Now this position is lost for black, just one pawn for a rook. I think the best way to fight on is to take the second pawn and hope for the best. Instead he plays a little trap.} 36. Rg8 {What would you play here for black dear reader?} Rd1+ {Did you find it? Of course, if I take the rook immediately, 37. Qxc6 is mate.} 37. Kh2 {King moves.} Qxg8 {I take.} 38. Qxc6+ {He takes.} Kd8 {and, two rooks down, white resigns. Thank you for reading. Please leave a comment or two, and rate it on the star system to let me know how I am doing with my annotations. Until next time dear reader!}
