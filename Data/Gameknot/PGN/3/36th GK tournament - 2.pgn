1. d4 {Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat! this game shows why sometimes it pays not to resign even when in a bad situation.} d5 2. Nf3 h6 {i think this opponent has done some homework and spotted that I've been playing the Torre attack a lot recently. h6 prevents my usual 3.Bg5} 3. e3 {...so I'll try something different this time.} Bg4 {nice pin on knight. I like to play this move.} 4. Nbd2 {to maintain knight on f3 is exchange is played.} Nf6 5. h3 {don't like that bishop hanging around there!} Bh5 6. Be2 e6 7. c3 Bd6 8. Ne5 {if Bxe5 exchange is taken white will gain a material advantage so Bxe2 likely here.} Bxe2 {as expected.} 9. Qxe2 Bxe5 10. dxe5 {the game is somewhat simplified now but I'm not too happy with my position after these exchanges.} Nfd7 11. O-O Nxe5 {oops! forgot to defend the pawn. Big mistake and now I'm material down.} 12. f4 Nec6 13. Qg4 {attacking g7.} Qf6 14. e4 {intending attack on queen with 15.e5 or 14.dxe4 15.Nxe4} h5 {clever counter attack.} 15. Qe2 dxe4 16. Nxe4 Qg6 17. Ng5 O-O 18. Qb5 {attacking b7.} b6 {but easy to defend, however blacks c6 knight now under pressure} 19. f5 exf5 20. Rxf5 {building pressure on f7} Ne7 21. Rf3 {Re5 may be better option. comments welcome...} c6 22. Qb3 {more pressure on f7} Nd5 {good block on queens diagonal.} 23. c4 Nf6 24. Bf4 {looking to bring other rook into play. in hindsight I don't like this move!} Nbd7 25. h4 {defending knight to allow bishop to change direction and attack f rook} Nc5 {good move. prevents c pawn advancing and chases queen from dangerous position.} 26. Qe3 Rfe8 27. Qf2 Ng4 28. Qf1 {queen on the run! good pressure from black.} f6 29. Nh3 {only safe square for the knight. good pressure from black.} Ne6 30. Bd6 {walking into danger! bad move by me!} Nd4 {black's knights are very well positioned! lots of danger for white to think about now. f3 rook in big trouble, can be forked by d4 knight in many possible situations. 31.Ne2  is of particular concern.} 31. Nf4 {calculated risk by me here. if 31.Nxf3 I can play 32.gxf3 then gain g4 knight after queen moves to safety. however black can move queen to safety first. Moving my knight to f4 does however cover danger square e2.} Qe4 {massive danger to white now.} 32. Rd3 {rook can now move here safely as danger of Ne2  then Qxd3 is removed} c5 33. b4 {trying to make an escape for stranded bishop on d6} Nc2 34. Rc1 Nxb4 35. Ra3 a5 36. Bc7 Qb7 {escape now impossible forbishop. have to be bold and go for attack.} 37. Rg3 {planning Nxh5 next to put pressure on g7} Qxc7 38. Nxh5 Qf7 {I think Qd7 would have been better for black here.} 39. Nxg7 {if knight exchange taken i gain a pawn. risky when material down but little else open to me.} Qxg7 40. Qf4 {black must move king or queen or looses queen.} Kf7 41. Rxg4 Qh8 42. Qc7+ Re7 43. Qxb6 {picking off a few pawn could help things later.} Qh5 44. Rf4 Qh6 45. Rcf1 {big pressure on f6} Kg7 46. Qxc5 {perhaps Rxf6 would be better but black could respond with Qxh4.} Raa7 {e7 rook easily defended} 47. Qd4 {pressure back on f6 and pawn pinned.} Ra6 48. Rg4+ Kf7 49. c5 {planning attack on knight with 50.a3 51.Qc4} Rae6 {well spotted by black} 50. Qc4 {pins rook on e6.} Qe3+ 51. Rf2 {mistake! Kh2 better i think.} Rd7 {threatening Rd1 or Rd2.} 52. g3 {mistake. pinned rook in danger of Nd3} Nd3 {I am in serious trouble. f2 rook is dead, how can i make the best out of a bad situation? nearly resigned at this stage until I spotted a speculative last throw of the dice...} 53. Qc2 {...this was the move. Will end up a rook down after 53.Qxf2  54.Qxf2 54.Nxf2 55.Kxf2. this would be effectively game over, but if black fails to spot danger and plays Nxf2 first then I have the winning move 54.Qh7 } Nxf2 {wow! black didn't spot the danger! what a mistake!!} 54. Qh7+ Ke8 55. Rg8# {What an escape this was for me! I deserved to loose this game from an early stage, but somehow snatched victory when I was on the verge of defeat. }
