1. e4 {Here's an example of developing your minor pieces with tempo.  Developing with tempo is important because it brings your pieces into the fray quicker than your opponent.  When developing with tempo you are creating a threat that your opponent has to deal with before continuing with  his/her attack.} d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {The early development of the queen offers an excellent target.} 3. Nc3 {Developing the Knight and attacking the queen.} Qg5 4. Nf3 {Again developing the Knight and attacking the queen.} Qa5 5. d4 {Freeing the dark squared bishop.} Bg4 {Pins the Knight.} 6. Bb5+ {A useless check, c6 means I need to take another move to save my bishop and  allows the Queen a flight path if danger appears} c6 7. Bc4 e6 8. Qd3 Qd8 {Of the first eight moves, the queen as moved four times only to end up on it's starting square.  Black has only moved one minor piece while next move white will have developed all four minor pieces and can castle on either side.} 9. Bf4 {Completing my development of the minor pieces.} Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {Trading off black's only active piece. This leaves the d4 pawn hanging.} Qxd4 {Now the d-file is open for white to exploit.  First to save my bishop.} 11. Bb3 Bd6 {11 .. Bd6??, 12 Rd1 threatening black's queen and bishop} 12. Rd1 Qf6 13. Rxd6 {Preparing to double my rooks on the d-file, scare the queen off the h4-d8 diagonal, pinning both Knights to the Rooks.} Ne7 14. O-O O-O {Ng6 before castling offers the escape Qd3, if black captures the bishop Rd8  leads to checkmate} 15. Rfd1 {Threatening 16 Rd8 ... 17. Rxf8  Kxf8 18. Rd8#   but I didn't react to Ng6 threat.  Oops!    } Ng6 {The Queen is now protecting the d8 square postponing my plans and attacking my f4 bishop.} 16. Ne4 {Black can still gain a piece through Qxf4 17 Qxf4 Nxf4.  Unfortunately 16...Qxf4 17 Qd3 leads to 17...Ne5 18 Qd4 Nbd7 19 Rxd7 Nxd7 20 Qxd7 leads to an even game} Qxb2 {Mistake, the queen is no longer protecting the d8 square.} 17. Rd6d8 {Finally what I've been working for.  After trading Rooks I have to be careful of the backrank mate.} Rxd8 18. Rxd8+ Nf8 19. Qd1 {Keeps both Knights pinned and protects white's backrank.  Black's only active piece is the black queen.} h6 {Providing black's King a flight square when captures the f8 Knight (Bd6,Rxf8)} 20. c3 {I needed to block the a1 diagonal for Nf6 } h5 {Don't use two separate moves when one will do.} 21. Bd6 {Black resigned.  Mistakes were made by both tactically however black's queenside Knight and Rook were never moved and Black never had more than the queen and one minor piece activated.  All of your pieces need to work towards your common goal.  If not then you're out numbered.}
