1. e4 {This game shows how a simple tactic can leave me with an easily won game on move 10.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {The Philidor is somewhat passive, but it is safer than the sharper Nc6.} 3. d4 Qe7 {Capturing is better because then Black can make a useful developing move instead of moving the queen to an unimportant square.} 4. Bd3 {I thought about playing Nc3 here, but I wanted to get castled as soon as possible to get my king off the queen's file and to have Re1 to defend my centre pawn.} exd4 5. Nxd4 d5 {Black's e-file threats are not dangerous because once I castle and get my rook to e1, I will control the e-file.} 6. O-O Nf6 7. Bg5 {Black doesn't have time to chase away my bishop with 7...h6? because I am threatening 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. exd5, winning a pawn. And Black won't be able to take my knight with 9...Qxd4?? because I play 10.Bb5  winning the queen.} dxe4 {Black's d5 move earlier was a mistake because I can force the opening of the e-file, where my rook can become a threat to black's king and queen, and black will have to waste a move developing his bishop because of his incorrect Qe7 move.} 8. Re1 Be6 {Black has to block the e-file from attack by my rook. When you castle early and control the centre files with rooks or a queen, you can often create tactics against an uncastled king in the centre, giving you an easily won game on move 10.} 9. Rxe4 {Black's only developed pieces are tied up, and his queen is blocking his bishop's path for development, preventing him from castling kingside. Black's e6 bishop is especially weak, so Black needs to be on the lookout for tactics along the e-file.} h6 {9...h6?? A losing blunder. Black still doesn't have time to chase away my attacking pieces. His only hope was to play 9...Nbd7 and try to castle queenside, where my advantage isn't immidiately winning like with 9..h6??} 10. Rxe6 {Black wasn't aware of the tactical dangers on the e-file, so now I have an easily won game.} fxe6 11. Bg6+ {Now I am driving Black's king to the open d-file where my queen dominates.} Kd7 {The other choice Kd8 results in the same fate as Kd7 played in the game.} 12. Nf5+ {I win Black's queen, because of my genius exchange sacrifice. If Black had played 11...Kd8, then 12.Nc6   would also win the queen, because the king is double checked, so the queen cannot block.} Qd6 13. Nxd6 cxd6 {I now have an extra queen, for the price of a rook. A winning advantage. As long as I continue to make accurate moves, my win is simple.} 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Qf3 {A mini-tactic, I am threatening Qxb7 and Qxf6.} Kc7 16. Qxf6 Rg8 17. Qf7+ {Another tactic, now that I am going to win a rook, I will be up an entire queen, and the rest of the game was won easily.} Nd7 18. Qxg8 Kb6 19. Nc3 Nc5 20. b4 Na6 21. Qxe6 Bg7 22. Qxd6# {This game shows how seeing tactics can give you an overwhelming advantage, making your game a lot easier to win.}
