1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 {Accelerated London system. Resembling the Colle System, white develops the Bishop to Bc1-f4 the hallmark of the London. The orthodox move order has always been on the 3rd move, e.g., 1. d4 2. Nf3 3. Bf4 to what ever Black plays. The Accelerated London develops the bishop on move 2. I'm not a Londoner so I'm not going to write the pros and cons of The orthodox London vs the accelerated London system and how it is meant to deal with Black's moves. I just know it's really in vogue right now and a hot opening for White because Magnus Carlsen has played it. I will add black will face a blunted King's Indian Defense if both sides were to develop their own system, i.e., The london system vs the King's Indian Defense. For example, 1. d4...Nf6 2. Nf3...g6 3. Bf4...Bg7 4. e3...d6 5. Be2..0-0 6. 0-0. } c5 3. e3 Nd5 4. Bxb8 Rxb8 {White's 4th move gains a tempo. In future cases black has to ready for such cases because King's Indian players tend to favor their Knights. } 5. e4 {! White gains two tempi one by exchange and one by attacking. } Nf6 {The singular move as Nc7 & Nb6 block the Qd8 from moving. Nf4 &Nb4 leave the knight hanging and without support.  Black regains the tempi he lost on the previous move.  The e4/d4 pawn duo Alekhine opening or Sicilian nimzovich opening.  White would need to be very flexible and knowledge with his opening knowledge to this. This is no longer a London opening it's a 1 e4 opening!} 6. Nc3 cxd4 7. Qxd4 Qb6 {?! A mistake on my part and leads to a bad pawn structure. } 8. Qxb6 axb6 9. Bb5 {a pin!} g6 {In keeping of the theme "King's Indian" I attempt to fianchetto my bishop.  At this stage of the opening it's proven to be to late and pointless. } 10. O-O-O Bg7 11. f3 {The pawn chain at g2/f3/e4 resemble that are commonly seen in Sicilians games, e.g., the Yugoslav attack in Sicilian Dragons, and The English attack in Najdorf.  } e5 {Singular forced. As castling would allow 12. e5 attacking Nf6 and losing the pawn on d7. } 12. g4 g5 {forced. } 13. Nd5 Nxd5 {singular forced. } 14. Rxd5 Ke7 {Black has a bad pawn structure now.  The bishop on g7 is blocked in by its own pawns.} 15. Ne2 d6 16. Rhd1 {White has achieved an positional advantage with double rooks on the semi-open d-file. } Rd8 17. Ng3 Bf8 {17...Be6 may have been better but still allows Nf4+} 18. a3 Kf6 {18...Be6 seems better. } 19. Nh5+ Ke6 {? bad square to go to. } 20. Bc4 {!} Ke7 21. Rb5 Be6 {A move that should have been played a long time ago. } 22. Bd5 Rd7 23. Rxb6 {White has a technical win.  Gameknot's computer engine has my position evaluated at  -3.14 which is means I'm down a piece. Well, I resign in lieu of a very long defensive game where I'm still losing at the end. }
