1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bd3 {an odd move for a weaker player, Bc4 being the main line, this move weakens his position and eventually leads to terrible consequences} Bc5 4. O-O d6 5. Nc3 Bg4 6. h3 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Nd4 8. Qg4 Qf6 {blunder by me, allows Nd5!} 9. Nd5 {! attacks the queen, threatens Nxc7  fork, also threatens Qxg7 winning the rook if Qd8} Qg6 {the lesser of all the evils, loses the rook, but takes his knight out of the game} 10. Nxc7+ Kd8 11. Nxa8 Qxg4 {cracks open his castle} 12. hxg4 Nf6 13. g5 Nh5 14. Bc4 {terrible move, allows my knights to run wild} Nxc2 {pins the pawn on f2 to his king} 15. Rb1 {rooks only square} Ng3 {he can't take because of the bishop pin} 16. Rd1 {again a forced rook move and his king is in trouble} h6 {the ultimate poisoned pawn, if he takes Rxh6 checkmate on the h file is forced} 17. gxh6 {he takes} Rxh6 {game over} 18. d3 {weak attack because all of his other pieces are immobilised and his king is completely helpless} Rh1# {even down a full rook, an open file can still dominate}
