[Opening "Sicilian defence (B20)"]

1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 {This is considered dubious because the bishop can be driven away.} e6 {Preparing d5.} 3. d3 {Blocking in the bishop.} Nc6 {I decide to develop before making the push.} 4. Nf3 d5 {Leave, bishop.  Probably preparing b5 to drive the bishop away is better, since the bishop can be totally trapped with c4, similar to the Noah's Ark trap in the Ruy Lopez.} 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bb5 {Perhaps Bb3 would have been safer.  I could have continued with a6 and b5, but the bishop would not have been completely trapped, so I went for something more aggressive.} Qa5+ {Forking the king and bishop.} 7. Nc3 {The only way to save the bishop.} d4 {However the knight is now threatened.} 8. Bxc6+ {Getting something for the bishop.} bxc6 9. Qe2+ {The ensuing pin will be annoying in the future.} Be7 {I chose this blocking move because the bishop is not really more useful on d6, while the light bishop and knight have more useful moves.  This also orients my bishops towards the kingside.} 10. O-O {The knight could have been saved with Bd2, where dxc3 leads to 11. Bxc3 Qwhatever 12. Bxg7, with Bxh8 unavoidable. A defense such as Nf6 or Kf8 lets the knight escape with tempo.} dxc3 11. bxc3 Qxc3 12. Be3 {Discovered defense combined with a potential threat.} Ba6 {Pinning d3 (although I don't know why I considered that significant).} 13. Bf4 {Why not move it there in the first place?} Nf6 {Hopefully the king can castle soon.} 14. Bd6 Nd5 {A nice post as well as being a defensive move.} 15. Bxe7 Nxe7 16. Rae1 Qf6 {Protecting the knight to restore the balance.} 17. Ne5 O-O {At last, a chance to escape the pin, but a fork ensues.} 18. Nd7 Qe6 {Better than 18...Qd6 19. Nxf8 Rxf8 20. Qxe7 Qxe7 21. Rxe7, losing the rook.  This only loses the exchange and a pawn.} 19. Nxf8 Rxf8 20. Qxe6 fxe6 21. Rxe6 Bb5 {?? I don't know what I was thinking here.  Re8 would have been fine.} 22. Rxe7 a5 23. Re5 c4 24. dxc4 Bxc4 25. Rfe1 Bxa2 {When down in material, trade pawns not pieces.} 26. Rxa5 Bd5 27. Re7 Bf7 28. Raa7 {If the bishop moves, Rxg7  Kh8 Rxh7  Kg8 Rag7# If the rook moves (other than threatening mate, I later noticed), Rxf7} c5 29. c4 {Stopping the c pawn, so it can't reach bishop protection.} h6 {Trying to open an escape for the king.} 30. Rac7 {At first I thought, "no way to stop Rxc5 and the promotion of the pawn," then I saw a chance.} Rd8 {Threatens Rd1 , followed by Rxe1#.  This also allows me to move the bishop, e.g. 31. h3 Bxc4 32. Rxg7  Kf8 and the checking cannot continue.} 31. h3 Bxc4 32. Rxc5 {Now all the action is on the kingside.} Bd3 33. Rcc7 {Making the seventh rank threat again.} g5 {Avoiding pawn loss.} 34. g3 Rb8 {Distracting him with some checks?  This also allows Bf5 to threaten Bxh3, as the king can head to d8 if checked.} 35. f4 Bf5 {Not gxf4 gxf4, giving white a passed pawn.  Trying to force white to move a pawn (Kg8 or Kh8 is met with Rb2 ).  If g4, white has a backwards pawn.} 36. fxg5 hxg5 {Now h4 leaves white with just a h pawn, which I think gives me the best chance of drawing.} 37. Re5 {If Bxh3, Rxg5 leaves black with a passed pawn.} Bxh3 {Rf8 fails to g4, losing the g pawn anyways. Rb1  doesn't accomplish anything; the king can move Kf2-e1-d2-c1, and the rook has to move back to the 8th rank to avoid checkmate, so the bishop is lost.} 38. Rxg5+ Kf8 {Not Kh8 Rh5 } 39. Rh5 {Better would be g4, trapping the bishop.} Be6 {Protecting against Rh8#.} 40. g4 Kg8 {Moving the king to prevent Rh8, allowing the bishop to move perhaps to f7.  An immediate Bf7 would have lost to Rf5. This does allow the fork Rg5  if the bishop moves to the g file.} 41. g5 Bf5 {At this point I was doubting this game is drawable unless white blunders. Apparently Rb5 would have lead to a combination winning the pawn.} 42. Rh6 Rd8 {Preparing Bd7 to block the rook.} 43. g6 Rd7 {Bd7 falls to Rh7, where Bf5 (trying to win pawn or rook) loses to Rg7 , etc. to mate since the king can't get to the d file. I'm thinking that after Rxd7 Bxd7, it's hard to protect the pawn and the rook. Apparently white could have kept the pawn with this move, while Rd6 would have won it.  I keep failing to notice the potential pins.} 44. Rc1 {If Rxd7 Bxd7, White can't safely prevent Kg7, where the bishop can take the pawn. I think Rc6 was the only move that protected against Kg7, as that leads to Rh7  Kg(f)8 Rc8 , with mate to follow.} Kg7 {At last!} 45. Rc6 {White makes a final mistake.  A better move would have lost the pawn, however, and lead to a drawn endgame.} Kxh6 {This is still a draw.  A rook and bishop vs. rook is usually a draw (and certainly would be with me on offense).} 46. Kf2 Bxg6 {I offered my opponent a draw rather than trying for a win for 50 turns.  An endgame database confirmed that either the 2R vs. R B or R B vs. R are theoretical draws.}
