1. e4 {Here's a game I played in the first round of the Casual section in the 35th Tournament. I already had four points, and my opponent had two wins and no losses. So this game decided who passed to the next round, and it has a lot of pressure. I started with this common move.} e6 {The French Defense. It requires a long and precise defense... If Black doesn't play accurately, White will soon have the initiative.} 2. d4 {White tries to claim the center.} a5 {?? A bad move and an outright loss of tempo. Blunder.} 3. Nf3 h6 {? A prophilactic move,since it prevents Ng5, but with no sense of opportunity. Black should develop his pieces first.} 4. Bc4 {(?) The " Italian" development of the Bishop. I later realized this was a bad square for the clerk.} d5 {! White necessarily loses tempo. This opening principle is valid in this situation : one should develop Knights before Bishops. This move would have lost his power with Nc3.} 5. exd5 exd5 6. Bd3 f6 {? A move that weakens Black's Kingside and stops ... 0-0 .} 7. O-O {Natural.} Nc6 8. Re1+ Nge7 {The Knight is now pinned.} 9. Bb5 {Another  piece gets pinned.} Qd6 {?} 10. Nc3 h5 {?} 11. h3 {White doesn't want a minority attack on his rock.} g6 12. Nh4 {Notice that this move is possible because Black's Kingside is full of holes.} Bg7 {?? It would have been better Rg8, to defend the g-pawn.} 13. Nxg6 {The multiple pins start to pay off, because Black can't capture with ... Nxg6.} Rh7 14. Nxe7 {!! A grand move. The second pin pays dividends, because Black can't recapture the Knight with his own Knight and won't trade his Queen for the Rook and the Knight.} Bd7 15. Nc8+ {!! the move that forces the Queen to be traded for one Rook.} Qe6 16. Rxe6+ Bxe6 17. Qe2 Rxc8 18. Qxe6+ {!!} Kd8 19. Nxd5 Bf8 {The other option was Bh8} 20. Qxf6+ Kd7 21. Qf5+ {!!} Kd8 22. Qxh7 Ke8 23. Nf6+ {And now, the coup de gr√¢ce.} Kd8 24. Qd7# {Checkmate.}
