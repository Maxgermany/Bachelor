[Opening "Sicilian (B22), 2.c3, Heidenfeld variation"]

1. e4 {Black plays the opening poorly and it is clear that white has an advantage. eventually white wins a pawn but black gets an open g file toward the white king which ultimately proves decisive when white continues his attack with a natural but very weak move. i hope you enjoy.} c5 {i don't usually play the sicilian, but i fancied something different. my usual against e4 is Alekhines defence} 2. c3 {the c3 sicilian, i really have no idea how to play against this.} Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 {now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on c5} cxd4 5. cxd4 {apparently Nf3 is more accurate here as the d pawn is pinned to the knight on d5, but i think it would just transpose to the game next move anyway} d6 {i've let white build a centre so now i've got to attack it before his pieces can orginise themselves to defend it} 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Bc4 Nb6 {i didn't like the look of 7...e6 as it give white alot of ways to hurt my pawn structure which i'd have to keep an eye on} 8. Bb5 a6 {i think the exchange on c6 improves my pawn structure here.} 9. Bxc6+ bxc6 10. O-O {i think whites position is better here, he has a space advantage and a slight lead in development, but black has a definate target to aim at - the white centre} Bf5 {this is a strong diagonal for the bishop as it controls some good squares deep in enemy territory and white has no light square bishop to oppose it.} 11. Nh4 {so he forces it to move} Bd7 {although the bishop is now not as active the white knight is off side on h4} 12. Nc3 Nd5 {maybe trying to activate the dark square bishop via g7 would be a better plan} 13. exd6 {if 13.Nxd5 cxd5 14.exd6 e6! and blacks pawn structure is very nice and the d6 pawn will be won soon} Nxc3 {13...e6 is an interesting alternative but it looks like it is met well with 14.Qg4} 14. bxc3 exd6 15. Re1+ Be6 {the natural 15...Be7? loses to 16.Bg5! Be6 (16...f3? 17.Qh5 ) 17.Bxe7 Kxe7(17...Qxe7? 18.Nf5 Qf8 19.Qa4! Kd7 20.d5! is a massacre) 18.d5 cxd5 19.Qxd5 looks very good for white} 16. Nf5 {this is a rather annoying move that seems to tie down the black army.} Kd7 {this seemed the best way to side step the threats, 16...g6 17.Nh6 is strong, keeping the black king in the centre} 17. Ne3 {here i completely missed the point and ended up paying for it.} Be7 {? not a good move, ...d5 was required here preventing d5 from white} 18. d5 {!} cxd5 19. Nxd5 {Qa4  is another way to exploit blacks mistake on move 17} Qa5 {black prevents any future Qa4 ideas from white and threatens the knight} 20. Nxe7 {! i didn't think this was so strong at the time as i missed whites next move} Kxe7 21. Qd4 {! a strong move, either winning the g pawn or forcing black further onto the back foot} Qc5 {here i decided it was better to lose the pawn and get some chance of counter play than to play the very ugly looking Rhg8} 22. Qxg7 Rag8 23. Qh6 {i think Qd4 was better here, although black can't claim any compensation after the text move} Kd7 {now all of the black forces are mobile and pointing at the white kingside, ready to pounce on any mistake white makes} 24. Bd2 {?? Which happens straight away! 24.Bf4 was the correct move, white should ignore the c pawn and play for the attack. This move, however, allows black to smash open the white kings defences and go on the offencive} Rxg2+ {! the only way to take advantage of whites inaccurate 24th move} 25. Kxg2 Rg8+ {if the bishop had been on f4 then the bishop could simply parry the check by dropping back to g3} 26. Kf1 {! the best square for the king, in fact the only square that doesn't lead immediately to mate, 26.Kh1?? Bd5 , 26.Kf3 Bg4 ! the variations after 26.Kf3 were the ones i spent most of my time on as black has so many promising looking follow ups unlike the variation after the text move which is quite simple to see as there aren't many other options} Bc4+ 27. Re2 Qd5 {! the key move in this variation. its amazing to say it but now white is lost, there is no way to defend everything.} 28. Qh3+ {! the best defence - the only way to aviod mate} Kc7 29. f4 {giving the king an escape square} Qxd2 {now black is only down the exchange and has all the play, the black king is surprisingly secure on c7 where as the white king has pieces swarmiing all around him.} 30. Qf3 {not 30.Re1?? as black mates after 30...Qxf4 . everything looks to be defended here but black still has one more little tactical trick to secure the win} Bxe2+ 31. Qxe2 Rg1+ {! the king can't possibly keep the queen defended as 32.Kf2 loses to 32...Rg2  } 32. Kxg1 Qxe2 33. Rf1 Qxa2 {and white resigns as he has no chance of any counter play as the rook can't stray far from the king without getting forked and black will soon march his a pawn to promotion}
