1. e4 {"One swallow doesn't make a summer"  Let's go through a draw game: svenne13 (1812) vs. lecce-wulf (2188) 33rd GK tournament.} c5 {Invitation to play a "Sicilianish" game.} 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6 {B30 Sicilian (four Knights). } 4. Be2 {Straight Bb5 is better as Svenne played it later in the game.  Also Bd5 is very popular in recent years and Be2 is old-fashioned move (J N Berger vs Paulsen 1887	DSB-05.Kongress). but lecce-wulf failed to exploit this lack of confidence of his opponent in the opening and obviously a lack of knowledge of this opening. Perhaps that was a psychological move!  Stats: W:33%;D:33%;L:33% !! } e5 {or ...d5 but lecce-wulf wanted to avoid e5 leading to exchanges...} 5. O-O Be7 6. Bb5 {As said, why now and not in the fourth move?} d6 7. d3 O-O 8. Bxc6 bxc6 9. h3 {lecce-wulf didn't look bored by the doubled-pawn. Many lower rated players exchange their bishop to a Knight.} Nd7 10. Be3 Rb8 11. b3 f5 {Lecce-wulf didn't lose time : Investigation is on the King side.} 12. Re1 f4 {Svenne13 must regretted the previous move but he will demonstrate his nerves capacity to handle the blacks attack} 13. Bd2 Qe8 {Variation: 13. ... Nb6 14.a4 Be6 15.a5 Nd7 16. a6 Qe8 17.Qe2} 14. a3 Qg6 15. Kh1 Qh6 16. b4 Rf6 17. Ne2 Nb6 18. bxc5 Bxh3 {Preparation of a classical discovered attack with check. the purpose of it is to win material but here the bishop would have nothing to win.} 19. Nh2 {19. ... Nxb6! ok-move} Bg4 {The Knight is pinned. variation: 19....Rg6 20.gxh3 Qxh3 21.Nxf4! forced exf4 22.Qf3 Qxf3 23.Nxf3 dxc5 24. Bxf4 etc. Balck has a little advantage in terms of material and position.} 20. Kg1 Be6 21. cxb6 axb6 {it was interesting to analyse but after thoughts I could not find a strict advantage for balck.} 22. Nxf4 exf4 {f3-pawn will take part of the attack but won't help the pieces involved in it as f3 is pinned by the dark-square white bishop ... } 23. Ng4 {this is the only place to go for the Knight. } Bxg4 24. Qxg4 Rg6 {...looks scary to me but doesn't create much threats.} 25. Qf3 {25. Qd7 is better threats on c6 and Be7... but Svenne13  was afraid of f4 pawn supported by the Rook and the Queen it gives:25.Qd7 Qg5 26.g3 Qf6 and black are obliged to sack the rook to draw the game... 27.Bxf4 Qxf4 28. Qxe7 Rxg3  29.fxg3 Qxg3  etc.  1/2 1/2} Rf8 26. Rab1 b5 27. c4 bxc4 28. dxc4 Rg5 29. Rb6 Rh5 30. Kf1 {an other interesting situation: black's threat: mate on Rh1   and white has a passed pawn. 30... Rh1  31. Ke2 Rxe1  32. Bxe1 c5 33. Rb7 Qe6 34. Qd3 Re8 35. Bc3 Bf6 36. Bxf6 Qxf6 37. Qd5  Kh8 38. a4 Qc3 39. Rb6 Qc2  40. Kf3 Qxa4 41. Rxd6 Qb3  42. Kg4 Qa4 43. Qxc5 Rf8 44. Rd5 Qe8 45. Rf5 Rxf5 46. Qxf5 Qb8 47. e5 f3 48. gxf3 h6 49. e6 Qb4 50. Kh5 Kg8 51. Qf7  Kh7 1-0 } Rc5 31. Bb4 Rxc4 32. e5 {the idea is nicely prepared from Svenne13. He knows that Qh1  could not win the e1 rook.} c5 {Svenne13 could have played a straight check yet he was right not to... 33. Qd5  Kh8 34. Qxc4 Qh1  35. Ke2 f3  36. Kd1 fxg2 37. Qg4 cxb4 38. exd6 Bh4 39. Qe4 Qh3 40. Ra6 Qb3  41. Qc2 Qf3  42. Qe2 Qxf2 0-1} 33. Kg1 cxb4 {Lecce-wulf tried desperately to find out something in this tight game.} 34. Qd5+ Kh8 {Svenne13 hold it tight to lecce-wulf and this 34th move shows it brilliantly.} 35. Qxc4 f3 36. Rxb4 {The so-called-threat f4 eventually reached f3 but there's no tempo for lecce-wulf.  The white Queen is imperial controling the 4th and will easily control the a8-h1 diag. } d5 {Following moves could be: 37.Qxd5 Bb4 38. axb4 fxg2 39.Qxg2 Qd2 40.Rb1 h3 41. Rf1 Rf4 42.Qh3 Qe2 43.Qc8  Kh7 44.f3 Qxe5 45.Qc2  g6 etc.  46. Rf1  1/2 1/2}
