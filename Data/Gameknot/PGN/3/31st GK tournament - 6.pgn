1. e4 {This games stand as a prove that mistakes are the product of relaxing our mind in a simple position.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 {3.-Nc3 its not very popular anymore beacause white rarely gets a solid advantage out of the opening.} Nf6 4. Bc4 {4.-Bb5 was better, entering into a delayed "Knights atack" variation of the Spanish.} Bc5 5. d3 d6 6. Bg5 {Be3 was better.} h6 {A mistake.} 7. Bh4 {7.-Bxf6 gxf6 8.-Nh4 and white its winning the battle on the blockade of  the double pawns.  7.-Bxf6 Qxf5 8.-Nd5 Qd8 9.-c3 and white its better.} Bg4 {Mistake. g5 was the indicated move.} 8. a3 {Bxf6 was still posible.} g5 {Black finally reacts.} 9. Bg3 {The main point of it, its that with the Bg3, white may move h3, but he can not move g4 getting rid of the pin.} Nd4 {Not to use the pin as to play c6 and control the key square d5.} 10. h4 {apparently a dinmamic reaction but the move 10.-Nb5! seems the best.} Rg8 {The timmid 10.-...Nh7 was also possible, as to  inhabilitate 11.-hxg5 beacause of 11.-...Nxg5 or also, answer any move with 11.-....Qf6 } 11. Qd2 {Loses a piece, Nb5 was indicated.} Bxf3 {CLear its that 12.-gxh3 Nxh3  13.-Kd1 Nxd2 its a resignable positon.} 12. O-O {12.-gxf3 Nxf3  its a laughable matter. Altough the textual, castilng into it....} gxh4 13. gxf3 {Loses the queen but the bishop was already lost. 13.-Bxh4 Rxg2  14.-Kh1 Rxf2  15.-Kg1 Rg2  16.-Kh1 Rxd2  17.-Kg1 Rg2   its a long and FORCED windmill combination that wins the quen, three pawns and the bishop.} Nxf3+ {The rest require no comments.} 14. Kh1 Nxd2 15. Rfg1 hxg3 16. Rxg3 Rxg3 {Black has no objection in exchanging.} 17. fxg3 Nxc4 18. Kh2 {White's move  was by all means inaccurate.} Ne3 19. Rc1 Nfg4+ 20. Kh3 Qg5 21. Nd5 Qh5# {Mate.}
