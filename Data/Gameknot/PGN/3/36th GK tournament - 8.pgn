1. e4 {King Pawn's Opening} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Italian Game.} Nf6 {Two Knights defence} 4. Nc3 {I decide to play safe, since I am a little unfamiliar with this.  Four knights, Italian variation.  } Bb4 5. d3 {Not worried about Bxc3, cause that will end up being an advantage to me.  The pin will not last long due to my plan to castle.} d6 6. O-O {Removing the pin} Bxc3 {Personally, I don't like trading bishops for knights in the opening till I know how the game will proceed.  The double pawns in the center is actually an asset to me.} 7. bxc3 Na5 {Ok, I don't want to lose my bishop here needlessly.  Move to b3 and if he takes I can either open the a file or undouble my pawns.} 8. Bb3 c5 {This creates some weakness on light squares when I have a light bishop.} 9. Bg5 {Pin} b5 {Ok, so he is planning on pushing c4, causing grief for my bishop.  Cannot allow that.} 10. a4 Bd7 11. axb5 {Perhaps there was a better move, but I didn't see it at the time.  Maybe Bd5} Bxb5 12. Bxf6 {Bxf6!.  If Qxf6, Rxa5.  gxf6 is force to save the knight.} gxf6 13. c4 {Turn about is fair play here.  Push the bishop back.} Bd7 {Really the only logical place to go.} 14. Qd2 {Double attack on the knight.} Nc6 15. Ba4 {Partial pin on the knight through the bishop.} Nb8 16. Bxd7+ Nxd7 17. Qh6 {Threatening 18. Qg7 Rf8 19. Qxh8.} Qe7 {This stops the threat.  If 18. Qg7 Qf8.  I don't want to trade queens yet cause of my mobility and his exposed king.} 18. Nh4 {Working the knight to f5.} Qf8 19. Qd2 {Not sure, but  probably better would have been Qe3.} h5 {This move confused me, other than he wants to create space to get his queen and rook on the g file.} 20. Nf5 Qg8 21. Nxd6+ {Free pawn.} Ke7 22. Nf5+ Ke8 23. Qe3 {Threatening c5 pawn (guarded by knight at d7.)   Also help protect castled position.} Qg6 {Ok, he's going to line up on the file.  Also the h4 pawn push starts to complicate the game for me by disallowing Ng3 as a defensive move.} 24. h4 {Possible Nh4 would have been better.} Rg8 25. Qf3 {Protect.} Nb6 26. Ng3 {And block, also threatening Nxh5} Rh8 27. Ra5 {Threaten c5.} Nd7 {So this is the 3rd? time the knight has been at this square.  Seems like a waste of a lot of moves.} 28. Rfa1 {Attack (and win) a7.} f5 {this just offers up a free pawn.  Perhaps he wants to get his knight to f6} 29. Nxf5 Nf6 30. Ra5xa7 Rxa7 31. Rxa7 {Ok, threatening Ra8 , winning the rook} Kf8 {His only defense.} 32. Ra8+ Ne8 {Forced} 33. c3 {Semi-quiet move, threatening d4 and opening up the center.} f6 {Creating room for his king and protecting N@e8 with the queen.} 34. Nd6 {Attacking the pinned knight.  Potential of Rxe8  Qxe8, Nxe8 Kxe8 Qxf6 if his next move doesn't preclude it.} Kg7 35. Nf5+ {Ok, I want his king on the back rank.} Kf7 {And he is not going quietly.} 36. Ra7+ {Trying to push him back on the back rank} Kf8 37. Qe3 {Threaten Qxc5.} Qg4 {??  Allows mate in 2.} 38. Qxc5+ {Mate in 2 declared.  if 38. ... Nd6 39. Qxd6  Kg8 40. Qb8# if 38. ... Nd6 39. Qxd6  Ke8 40. Qb8# if 38. ... Kg8 39. Qd5  Kf8 40. Qf7#}
