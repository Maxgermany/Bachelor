[Opening "Sicilian (B50)"]

1. e4 {One of the better games I've played. White opens with 1 e4, and a Sicilian defence ensues...} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nf6 6. Be3 a6 {Sicilian, Najdorf.} 7. Bd3 {White now provides cover for his e4 pawn, while opening the rank for a Kingside castle.} g6 {Black responds with a suggestion of a fiancetto with his black-squared Bishop} 8. Nxc6 bxc6 {While Black's Queenside may appear weakened, he has succeeded in bringing two pawns in direct approach to the centre.} 9. Bd4 {White correctly pins the f6 Knight, however it is easily defended, and retreat is forced. Black succeeds in gaining a development move without reply.} e5 10. Be3 Bg4 {Black capitalizes by forcing a weakening of White's defences, should he choose to castle; with the only sensible response being 11 f3 (since White does not wish to weaken his e4 pawn by removing part of it's defence), Black has succeeded in controlling the order of his opponent's moves, and hinders development of White's Queen in the process.} 11. f3 Be6 12. b3 {This move may have been White's weakest point. Black clearly controls the game at this point, with the following move being obvious to most. Further, White has removed his c3 Knight's defence.} Qa5 13. Bd2 {Another forced move. Further, White's castling options are reduced to tatters.} d5 14. Nxd5 {A clever move from White. Black concedes a pawn, however was this gambit part of the plan?} Qd8 15. Nxf6+ Qxf6 {At this stage, Black looks desperate. At a glance, his position looks weak. It appears he has returned control to White with the loss of a pawn in the process. His Queenside pawns appear ragged and his Queen appears to be too enclosed to make an impact. He has yet to develop his King's Bishop, which appeared to be part of his plan earlier. Has he lost the plot, or is White bringing the game to Black?} 16. g3 {Correctly again, White prevents the imminent check, preventing another forced move.} Bc5 {Black now develops his Bishop, consolidating his weak side.} 17. b4 {Inevitable though it is, 17 b4 forces Black to move his Bishop. However, Black can retain centre position, and the slim advantage it now provides.} Bd4 18. Rb1 {With his white-squared Bishop poised, this appears to be the appropriate move, but can White afford to lose his pawn on a2?} Bxa2 19. Rb2 {White appears to have made a major error here. Can he return from this?} Bxb2 20. f4 exf4 21. Bxf4 Bc3+ {Now a rook to the good, Black can afford to drive the attack.} 22. Ke2 Bxb4 23. e5 Qe6 24. Qa1 Bd5 25. Rb1 Bd6 26. Kd2 {White has succeeded in driving Black's attack away, and his pawn structure looks reasonable. Materially disadvantaged, he is putting up a Warrior's battle.} g5 27. exd6 {A clever move from White. Have the tables turned?} gxf4 28. Qxh8+ Kd7 29. Qxa8 {In a sequence of 3 moves, Black overturns a large material deficit, and puts Black in a position that looked unlikely a few moves ago.} Qe3+ 30. Kc3 Qc5+ 31. Kd2 Qa5+ 32. c3 Qa2+ 33. Bc2 Be4 {Black has had to work hard to regain position. His Queen however was adequately positioned to force White's King into a corner. Now it appears the board is finely balanced.} 34. Rb7+ {Thus White needs to mount an attack of his own. The inevitable response is 34.. Kxd6, allowing White to plan his next move.} Kxd6 35. Qd8+ Ke5 36. Re7+ {36 Qg5  would have been a better option: 36.. f5 37 Qe7  Kd5 38 Rd7  Kc4 39 Qb4   or 36.. Bf5 37 Qxb5  Kd6 38 Rd7   or 36.. Ke6 37 Re7  Kd6 38 Qe5   or 36.. Kd6 37 Qe7  Kd5 38 Rd7  Kc4 39 Qb4   However, the following sequence of moves for White gives Black the time to regroup and retake the advantage, as we will now see...} Kf5 37. Qd7+ Kg5 38. Re5+ f5 {This is decisive for Black. A solid defensive move, which both defends and is defended by the bishop on e4.} 39. Qg7+ Kh5 40. g4+ Kh4 {Black seeks refuge behind White's own lines.} 41. Qh6+ Kxg4 42. Rxe4 {Another error by White, virtually hands control to Black, since White is now devoid of pieces to back up an attack on Black's King, and Black's pawn majority is prepared to give him a headache!} fxe4 43. Qg7+ {Desparate measures, as White attempts to regain control.} Kf3 44. Qxh7 {Good thinking, but too little too late. Black's turn now to control the final sequence of the game. He must, however finish it in this sequence, or he risks throwing it away, given White's slim material advantage. But how?} e3+ 45. Kd3 Qd5# {Short and swift. Black delivers the killer blow.}
