[Opening "Benko gambit (A58), Nd2 variation"]

1. d4 {In this game my opponent played the Benko gambit.  I'm not familiar with this opening at all so I was just pretty much winging it from move 6 on.  } Nf6 2. c4 {I thought that my opponent would go for the Queen's Indian (2...e6 3. Nf3 b6) or the Nimzo-Indian (2....e6 3. Nc3 Bb4) considering they are the most common openings on Gameknot in the Queen pawn game with Nf6.  Instead they went for the Benko gambit and caught me completely off guard.} c5 3. d5 b5 {And here we have the Benko Gambit.  I don't really know this opening very well so I decided to accept it and then just try to make the best moves since I am already out of the book.} 4. cxb5 a6 5. bxa6 Bxa6 {The Benko accepted.  Now I have to find a way to develop the f1 bishop.  That is the biggest problem for white in the Benko gambit.  Fianchettoing (sp?) on g2 doesn't look that good because of the pawn on d5, but I opted for it anyway.  The other option is to play Nc3 followed by e4.  Then after the capture on f1 (Bxf1) my castling privileges are gone and I would have to castle manually with g3 and Kg2.  I don't like the idea of g2 without my light-squared bishop to cover the holes.  So I went for the awkward fianchetto.} 6. Nc3 d6 7. Nf3 Nbd7 8. g3 {I waited a few moves to develop my bishop because I wanted to see what my opponent was going to do.  Besides it's better to develop your knights before your bishops.  Now that I see that he can't take advantage of my kingside weaknesses right away I try to get my king out of the center before it opens up.} g6 9. Bg2 Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. Re1 {I wanted to play e4, but it was pinned to my f1 rook.  Now I'm free to play e4.} Ng4 {I don't understand this or any of the next few knight moves.  If anyone knows of any benefit to this or the next 2 or 3 black moves, please tell me.  This is the downfall of black I believe} 12. Bd2 {I wanted to get my queen behind my bishop so I can play Bh6.  This was the only square where my opponent couldn't immediately harrass my bishop.  } Nge5 {Again, I'm dumbfounded......} 13. Qc1 {As planned, to create a major kingside weakness for my opponent.  Now I can't play e4 as I planned because Nd3 would really make me look stupid.} Nc4 {??} 14. Bh6 Bxh6 15. Qxh6 Nxb2 {Why go pawn hunting when I'm breathing down the king's neck?} 16. Ng5 {Now I threaten mate with Qxh7#} Nf6 {The only way to stop mate.} 17. Nce4 {But now there's nothing black can do and he resigned.  If black plays anything other Nxe4, I'll play Nxf6 , followed by mate on h7.}
