[Opening "de Bruycker defence (B12)"]

1. e4 {Standard white opening.} c6 {Caro-Kann defense, where 2. d5 will challenge the strong white center.} 2. d4 Na6 {?  This move develops the knight to a bad square and ignores the center.  I can understand that when playing someone rated higher than you, you want to take him into unfamiliar territory, but it has to be SOUND unfamiliar territory.} 3. Nf3 {Simple development.} Nf6 {?!  This move looks like simple development, but without having moved either center pawn, white can chase the knight all day.} 4. e5 {...and so I do.} Nd5 {The most logical follow up.} 5. c4 {White now has a big pawn center, and black had to retreat the knight to either b6 or c7 to preserve material equality.} Qa5+ {?  A bad move which loses a piece.  Black clearly wants to play Nb4.  He couldn't have done that this move, because a3 wins a knight, but as you'll see...} 6. Bd2 {This forces Nd-b4 anyway (or else white just plays cxd5, a piece up), and white wins a piece nonetheless.} Ndb4 7. a3 {You might think white doesn't win a piece, because axb4 is met by Qxa1, but the threat is to either exchange the Na6 or force it to move, and then play Bxb4.} e6 {Black defends the Nb4, but this is easily countered by...} 8. c5 {!  Cementing the win of the knight, as white can play Bxa6, exchanging the knight, followed by Bxb4.  Black is busted.} Bxc5 {Lashing out in desperation?} 9. dxc5 {Happy to pick up a bishop for my troubles...} Nd3+ {?  I expected black to try to take on c5 here, to get some compensation, but this move is particularly bad.} 10. Bxd3 {Because... now I have some pieces in place for a kingside attack, and black has no way to defend the kingside.} Qxc5 {Why not grab a pawn for your troubles?} 11. Nc3 {There could have been a faster way to attack the kingside, but black helps me out by neglecting the threat.  The more obvious threat is Ne4, hitting the queen.} Qb6 {Looking to grab the b2 pawn, perhaps?  I'm going to play Ne4 anyway, though, as the queen isn't my objective here.} 12. Ne4 {Now Nd6 looks nasty, but I have no desire to exchange my beautiful knight for his beastly bishop.} O-O {??  If ever there was an example of castling into it... yeesh.} 13. O-O {?!  Not so efficient on my part.  Although I wind up doing just fine, I should've just pressed ahead with the attack.  Still, it can't be TOO bad to shore up your own king's protection before pressing ahead with your attack?} Nc7 {Too slow, but I'm not sure there is a good defense at this point.} 14. Nfg5 {!  Good move, forcing weaknesses in the black kingside.} Nd5 {?  Missing the point.  Black should've moved a kingside pawn to try to defend.  White has a lot of threats now, like Qh5 threatening mate, but I wanted something more forcing.} 15. Nxh7 {!  Alright, maybe it doesn't deserve an exclam, but it sets up the beautiful 16th move for white.} Kxh7 {...with a little help from black.  Black could've held out longer (slightly) by not taking.} 16. Nf6+ {!!  Double check.  Black has no choice but to move the king back to h8, which is met by Qh5#.  Interestingly enough, despite losing this game, megarex currently has the advantage against me in our other game!} Kh8 17. Qh5# {1-0.  A nice lesson on the dangers of neglecting your development -- minors before majors!}
