1. d4 b6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bb7 {an iregular opening. in my opinion it cant be good for black...} 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 d6 {black is developing his tools very slowly. white has a great space to play in the center as well as in the king and queen side.} 7. O-O O-O 8. Bg5 Nbd7 9. Qc2 {the D row will be very powerful for white.} Re8 10. Rad1 e6 11. e4 {it seems that black is waiting for white to make his move. white, on the other hand, is gaining advantage in the center.} h6 12. Be3 c6 13. Qc1 Kh7 {not one peace was taken from the board and it is obvious that black is defending and white is attacking.} 14. e5 {time to break the ice!} dxe5 15. dxe5 {now the knight on d7 cant move and the other one has to move back to g8.} Ng8 16. Ne4 {the black king is wick. there many options to sacrifice a tool on g5 and afterwards f7 will fall too.} Qc7 17. Nd6 {also, d6 is a great place for the knight.} Ref8 {a must. sadly.} 18. Bf4 {building a future threat on the queen...} Rad8 19. Rfe1 {a quick sum: white has a great space to act with a knught on d6 and e,d,c rows open and semi-open. black lmost cant move, with a bad bishop on b7 and a poor king...} Ba8 {i think that black thought that i'm gonna change the knight for the bishop. even if i gained a pawn for it (on c6) it is not good. the knight is much stronger where it is.} 20. h4 {want to play h5...} f6 21. exf6 Ndxf6 {i think that Rxf6 is better...} 22. Rxe6 {what else?} Nh5 23. Rxg6 {what a great move!!! it took me some time to see it all the way through. black is simply lost.} Nxf4 24. gxf4 Kxg6 25. Qc2+ Kh5 {if Kf6 then... 26. Qf5  Ke7 27. Re1 ! Kxd6 28. Qd3  Kc5 29. Qa3  Kxc4 30. Bf1  Kd5 31. Qd3  Kc5 32. Rc1  Kb4 33. Qa3#} 26. Ne5 Bxe5 {a must!} 27. Bf3+ {it looks like the end...} Kxh4 28. Nf5+ {another great move!!! without a rook and a knight, white is won and black is lost.} Rxf5 29. Qxf5 Qg7+ {maybe: 29... Rxd1  30. Bxd1 Nf6 31. fxe5 was better, but it would only make black suffer longer.} 30. Kh2 Rxd1 31. Qh5# {a nice end for a great game. any comments will be in place. enjoy.}
