[Opening "QGD (D06), symmetrical (Austrian) defence"]

1. d4 {My favoured opening move, I have reasonable success with e4, but find d4 to lead to games where I am more comfortable. The move immediately strikes for the centre, and leaves many possiblities for tactical and positional matches.} d5 {The standard responce, black stakes his claim for the centre with no time lost.} 2. c4 {The queens gambit, I offer a pawn in exchange for the centre and a good initiative. Not often accepted at a high level, as the extra pawn cannot be held without losing material or initiatve.} c5 {Copying my move, knowing that just as I could recapture the c4 pawn if he takes, so he can recapture the c5 pawn if I take it. This is a very active opening, both players can anticipate free movement of pieces as the centre is unlikely to stand for long.} 3. e3 {Another pawn move. General opening advice states that you should avoid moving pawns as much as possible and should move pieces instead. However i felt that as my opponent has not yet moved any pieces I can afford to wait. The move also frees the f1 bishop and the queen, and directly protects the c4 pawn.} Nf6 {Following the good opening principles developing the knight to it's best square ready to stand in defence of his king when he castles kingside (with the queenside pawn structure as it is either side would be unwise to plan to castle long)} 4. Nc3 {Developing to a natural square} e6 {This is played for the same reason as my 3rd move, freeing the bishop which is preventing him from castling. Black here may be thinking about early castling then ripping apart the centre with some exchanges while my king is still central. However the immediate concern is developing quickly and seeing what opportunities arise.} 5. Nf3 {Another solid move, the knight stands on his best square and could move to the e5 square, which is a nice outpost for him if I get the chance to attack} Nc6 {Again a solid move. Black delays bringing his bishops out until he has a better idea of where they should go, which is normally dictated by the game, rather than a set principle like the knights.} 6. Bd3 {Brings the first bishop out to the centre. From here he looks towards blacks kingside, and can easily move round to the queenside if needed. The more modest Be2 may be better if there is a threat of Bg4 pinning the knight, however with the pawn on e6, there is no such threat.} Bd6 {Copying the move, and for the same reason. Both sides can now castle when ready.} 7. Bd2 {I chose to develop my final minor piece ahead of castling, there is little difference between either choice, and on another day I may well have castled instead of delaying it for a few moves.} O-O {Castle often castle early is the advice, which black duly follows. with his king safe, he can now consider more attacking options, such as breaking up the centre, and moves like Qb6. We'll see what he decides...} 8. a3 {I again delay castling, as from what I can see I am ready to do it when needed, so why do it before then...maybe not such good advice for beginners but I think you have to trust your instincts on when you should castle, rather than follow rules mechanically. The move is made to prevent Nb4, a pesky move driving the bishop to a remote square or trading a bishop for a knight.} a6 {This move from black carries more threat than my identical move, as he has castled so can make a move like b5 if he wants, I have no intention of doing so, I had made the move defensively. It's interesting that the development from both sides is fairly symmetrical, this tends to lead to draws unless one side unbalances the position.} 9. dxc5 {I grow tired of the symmetry so decide to shake things up. This move forces the bishop to move a 2nd time in the opening (which goes against principles) and moves the bishop to a square where he only attacks a pawn, so his movement is restricted} Bxc5 {Recapturng the pawn - notice that from this new position the only way he can move is back} 10. O-O {I finally decide to castle, the position is starting to open up, so it's time for the king to get to safety. It's still too early to think about good plans other than development, and the symmetry gives few options at the minute, however there's plenty of time...} Re8 {A good move, moving the rook to a file that is likely to be opened in the future, which is where he belongs.} 11. cxd5 {A second capture in the centre. In a positional sense this makes no sense. The recapture with the pawn will give both the rook and bishop with wonderful open files to work with. However I will have the better placed bishop, and have created an isolated pawn, which I feel is a weakness in the long run.} exd5 {Simple recapture, as previously explained this seems better for attacking options, as it offers open files and diagonals to work on.} 12. Qc2 {A modest move, but with a few attacking ideas. The bishop on c5 is undefended, so I may be able to manufacture threats against that, also the queen-bishop combo along the b1-h7 diagonal looks dangerous, even if there is no threat immediately} h6 {This move frees the knight, as it was pinned to the h7 pawn (it couldn't move without losing the pawn) It also creates a "luft" for the king, against any future back rank attacks. Perhaps weakens the kingside against a direct assault, however it's not a serious threat.} 13. Rfe1 {Preparing a possible e4 in the future, which could be dangerous combined with the threat to the c5 bishop.} d4 {So black sensibly decides to cut out the threat with a pawn push of his own} 14. exd4 {I prefered this to moving the knight as I feel he is well placed as he is, and i dislike having my opponent dictate the exchanges} Nxd4 {Black signals his intention for a mass exchange - retreating the queen via 15. Qd1 leads to 15...Rxe1 16. Bxe1 Nxf3 17. Qxf3 or something similar, where my position looks to have worsened due to the exchanges} 15. Rxe8+ {This is played as a prelude to the exchanges, black must recapture as he is in check, and with the queen on the file, I can swing the rook across to e1 and control the file. Giving the possibliity of back rank threats with the bishop covering the h7 square.} Qxe8 {Recaptures the rook. This is better than wasting a move with the knight for no good reason as he sits at a good square atm.} 16. Nxd4 {Rather than accept doubled pawns on the f-file, or retreating the queen, i take the iniative with an exchange of knights} Bxd4 {Recaptures, and takes a strong position attacking the potencially weak f2 square.} 17. Re1 {Taking command of the e-file as I had intended, this looks natural and strong. And if black is careless I can jump to the 8th or 7th rank and pressure his back line.} Qc6 {Moving the queen out of the range of the rook, and looking at my fairly isolated king.} 18. Ne4 {In this position if the knight and queen can be removed the rook can move to e8#. So this move attacks both the queen and the knight, without a definite threat, but a general idea.} Qb6 {A good move, countering my vague threat with 2 threats of his own. The pawns on f2 and b2 are both looking weak. Black threatens the straight forward Qxb2, and the more indirect Nxe4 follwed by Bxf2 } 19. Bc3 {Defending the threats with one move, this position looks very volatile with 4 pieces attacking and being attacked.} Bxc3 {The bishop cannot retreat to e5 obviously, and after 19...Bc5 20. Nxf6 leads to problems and black is forced to double pawns on the f-file.} 20. Nxf6+ {A nice inbetween move taking advantage of the threat Re8# to force black to double his pawns anyway, as neither Bxf6 or Qxf6 cover the threat} gxf6 {The forced recapture. At this point I have a target, the doubled pawns are a major weakness with so few pieces on the board, however I need to find a way of exploiting them.} 21. Qxc3 {Recapturing the piece, and equaling the position in terms of material. The immediate threat is Re8 , which forces the king away, then wins the underdefended bishop on c8. Also with my queen on c3 the black queen is pinned to defending the weak f6 pawn} Bd7 {Defending the threat of Re8, while Be6 looks better - blocking the rooks file - it loses the f6 pawn to 22. Qxf6} 22. Re7 {A rook on the 7th rank is a great asset - I can pressurise the whole black position.  1) The pawns now need defending by pieces 2) I am in a better position to make back rank threats 3) The rook immediately attacks the undefended bishop} Rc8 {A strong move, this counters my threat with a more powerful one, and looks to exploit my weak back rank (after the pawn moves my back rank is weaker than blacks)} 23. Qd2 {Avoids the threat, and sets up another counter threat, now the bishop is attacked and the pawn on h6 is attacked, black cannot defend both pieces in one move.} Qd8 {Yet another counter threat, the pawn is left undefended but my rook needs to move to safety so I can't take the pawn. I this position my first thought was 24. Rxe7 Qxe7  25. Bh7  Kxh7 26. Qxe7 winning the queen, however my weak back rank will be exploited by  26...Rc1 with checkmate in 1} 24. Re3 {The rook retreats ready to move to g3 to persue an attack} f5 {A quiet move, this move while making no threats has a number of objectives 1) Frees the f7 pawn to move if needed 2) Gives the queen a diagonal to move to the kingside (for defence or attack) 3) After f4 will prevent my rook from standing on g3} 25. Rg3+ {This move forces the king to move to the edge of the board where he is pinned in by the rook - the king must move to h7 to defend the attacked h6 pawn} Kh7 {Defends the pawn, but also gives his rook / queen a file to aim at my king in combo with his bishop if he moves the bishop onto the long diagonal (a8-h1).} 26. h3 {A slow move but nessessary to protect against any future attacks on my back rank. The move also gives the queen   bishop freedom to move into attack, as they currently have to protect the back rank} Be6 {Gives the queen freedom to move out off the back rank. Also makes vague threats like Bc4, against my pinned bishop, which could be difficult if I am careless.} 27. b4 {With no direct threat I can look to make my own threats - this move allows my queen to move to b2 with a checkmate threat at g7. It also means that my rook will be defending the backwards pawn after the bishop moves, rather than the queen} b5 {Blocks the pawn on b4 from moving to b5, although this wasn't much of a threat, I suspect black couln't find a move to improve the position, so made a move and waited for me to come up with a threat for him to defend. And in fairness there is little that he can usefully do, possibly something like Qf6, pre-empting my Qb2.} 28. Qb2 {Making the threat, and forcing my opponent to defend} f6 {Blocking the Queen and so stops the checkmate threat. Perhaps gives me a target as his 7th rank is very open, but his rook blocks the easiest entry to the 7th rank, so not feasible yet.} 29. Qb1 {So I create another threat, now against the f5 pawn.} Qd5 {Defends the pawn, and moves the queen into a powerful position} 30. h4 {No way to create a threat, so I look to improve my position. I intend to push the pawn to h5, blocking the king from moving via g6-g5 / g6-h5, if the rook moves.} Rg8 {A good move, forcing an exchange of rooks, as moving the rook away gives black checkmate (note Rf3 leads to Qxf3, as the g2 pawn is pinned)} 31. Rxg8 {Removing the rook, and freeing the black king to move. With the rooks gone from the board the chances of a direct checkmate are almost gone, so we move into the endgame, which given the position, and material equality should be drawn. I have a slight advantage given blacks doubled pawns, however it's not very significant yet} Kxg8 {Recaptures with the king - recapturing with the bishop allows Bxf5} 32. Qc2 {Looking to move to the 7th and 8th ranks, and allows me to move to c3, with a threat against the f6 pawn.} Kf7 {Moves the king towards the action, and nullifies any threat against the f6 pawn. Here it is tempting to consider Qc7, however the king will escape through g6, and be difficult to attack.} 33. h5 {So I block that square off. This move, while not very exciting now, puts the pawn where I need it at the end of the game, giving me the win} Qe5 {Preventing me from moving to c7, with counterthreats of Qa1  to pick up the a3 pawn} 34. Qc1 {Yet another counterthreat, defending my back rank, and attacking the undefended h6 pawn.} Kg7 {Defending the threat, although putting the king on an open file which proves crucial later} 35. Qe3 {A lot of thought went into this - I reasoned that after 35...Qa1  36. Kh2 Qxa3 37. Qxe6 Qxd3 38. Qe7 Kg8 (to avoid me taking the pawn with check) 39. Qe8  Kg7/Kg8 40. Qg6 , I can pick up the pawns on the f-file and h-file.} Qa1+ {Going to plan so far} 36. Kh2 {Forced} Qe5+ {A good choice, looking to force a queen exchange, as if I move the king, black can take the queen and isolate my pawn on the e-file: and if i take the queen black un-doubles his pawns. However I can avoid this because the king is on an open file, as I pointed out earlier} 37. Qg3+ {Now if the queen is taken, I can recapture with the king, and keep my superior pawn structure intact. However black is unwise to take the queen, because: 1) My bishop is able to attack his a b pawns, whereas his cannot attack mine. 2) His doubled pawns will be more of a weakness without the queens 3) He is less likely to force a draw - with queens he can try repetition} Qxg3+ {But he takes the queen anyway. I now have a definite goal - my king can move to attack the f5 pawn, while blacks king it trapped by my pawn on h5 (mentioned earlier)} 38. Kxg3 {Recapturing and starting the march towards his weak pawns} Kf7 {Helplessly trying to move round} 39. Kf4 {Ready to win the pawn, it will not guarentee me a win, but it puts me in a better position as black now has to force a draw while i can look for a win.} Ke7 {Black is probably considering moving to the queenside, however such a plan is in vain, as I will destroy his pawns and promote my h pawn before he gets close} 40. Bxf5 {winning the pawn. Blacks only move now is to move the bishop to d5 / c4, and wait for a chance to trade himself for 2 pawns to force a draw (bishop   king cannot win)} Bxf5 {Nope, black is now lost, as after the recapture he is unable to do anything but move his king, which allows me to push him back} 41. Kxf5 {Recapturing the bishop, and looking to move to g6} Kf7 {Blocks the king from g6} 42. g4 {Wastes a move, now black has to move the king allowing me to move to g6 or e6} Kg7 {The better choice although both lose, i can now move to e6} 43. Ke6 {My opponent resigns as again his king is forced to move from the f6 pawn (notice the h5 pawn i mentioned earlier blocks him from g6) I will grab the f pawn, then push my f pawn and g pawn to checkmate black in the corner. This was a good game - both of us developed well, blocked each others threats in the middle game, and only an endgame mistake gave me the win}
