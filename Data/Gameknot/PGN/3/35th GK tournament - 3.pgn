1. e4 {This was one of the toughest game I've been involved in on this site. In addition, it was the last game in our tourney group. It was to decide who goes to the next round. I was half a pt behind to iamthundercat, so the only way I advance is if I win. He wins or we draw, he moves on, and I am out. So we begin...} b6 2. Nf3 Bb7 {Fianchetto... strenghtening the diagonal side attacks,  and giving up the middle.} 3. e5 {I take the opportunity. Playing aggressive is my style. Sometimes this backfires, but I was willing to take my chance here. I also like to jam the black's King side, with either Knight or Bishop often times risking to get stuck and undeveloped...} c5 4. d4 e6 5. Be3 {Typical attempts at development. I am hoping to mantain control of the middle, but it doesn't seem to work so well. He is pulling all the right moves so far.} cxd4 6. Nxd4 Bc5 {Things are starting to get hairy. My Nd4 is not pinned, but the pressure on that diagonal is put. I have a feeling he'll exploit this somehow....} 7. Nc3 {But I continue to develop care free. I feel the d4 is protected adequately. } Ne7 {He is itching to develop king side pieces... preparing for something?} 8. Qg4 {I am thinking pulling out Queen at this point is not too early. I don't see immediate threat that would at the same time develop black. So I shift the Queen on the side where I expect he will Castle. Also the Queen provides additional support to g2 pawn attacked by the black Bb7.} Ng6 {For some reason I failed to see this move as dangerous... so I intend to continue developing... } 9. Bd3 {There it is, now I have Castling options as well, and I put pressure on his King side, attacking g6 as well. However, this was a weak move. It weakens protection to the g2 pawn, as well as it doesn't account for the following move by the black....} Qh4 {Oops, I did not see that! Note that if I exchange Queens, his Knight assumes h4 position, which will cause either loss of pawn, or loss of Castling options (g2 pawn is then under the attack by both Bb2 and Kg4... I can't advance the pawn as it is protecting a Rh1 from Bb2 attack, and I am not hot about playing Kf1). If I move Queen in any other way, my Nd4 is history as it is attacked then by both Bc5 and Qh4.} 10. h3 {I still have castling option on the other side, and maybe I can get my Rh1 involved early. I am losing my g2 pawn, but at this point I am at peace with this. It could be worse... } Bxd4 {Not too excited over how things are going so far. My hold on the center is not so important at this point, he is managing to develop as planned, he is attacking me in the middle of all places, and my development so far is fairly useless. My overagressive play seems to have backfired this time.} 11. Bxd4 Qxg4 {I thought he had better alternatives, but can't fault him for this move either. His management of the game is good.} 12. hxg4 Nc6 {However, after this move, I am thinking, I didn't lose g2 pawn, my h-file is opened, and now I can get my Rook involved early. Hey, I came out of this exchange great!} 13. Bxg6 {Here I am hoping to disrupt his King side castling.} fxg6 14. O-O-O {I was itchin to castle.} Nxd4 {Ok, so I did give up my g2 pawn... after the many worse alternatives I considered through this set of moves, this is no biggie.} 15. Rxd4 Bxg2 {There we go! Finally! This is where the 40 is spilled for the fallen homie. } 16. Rhd1 {Attempting to put pressure on his other castling option, while getting the other rook into the action.} Bc6 {This is where that plan comes to a screeching halt, since bishop now protects d7 .} 17. b4 {Gotta continue to push my pawns and get that Bishop out of there.} a6 {He is counteracting my plans very well. I do not like the prospect of his Ra8 getting into the action on the side where I castled.} 18. a4 {So I press my a -pawn! LOL} b5 19. a5 {There, I plug that a-file Rook option. But I still have a problem of Bishop firmly protecting his d7 pawn.} O-O {So tricked! His other rook is now thrown into action, his King protected, good move... although he didn't have many alternatives.} 20. f4 {Forced.} Rf7 21. Rd1d3 Raf8 22. Ne2 {Had to bring the Knight to protect the f-pawn. The f-file if opened to his rooks will spell all sorts of trouble for my King} Bd5 {I started to get really annoyed at his Bishop. It became a very strong piece. It singlehandedly neutralized both of my Rooks. Also, I didn't want him to attack me with Bc4.} 23. Kd2 {At that point it felt like we are stuck, so i figured bringing King into action would push the advantage on my side} Rc8 24. Nc3 {The pressure was taken off my f-pawn with that Rc8, so I could afford to move my Knight once again. Here I am blocking his rook attack as well as attacking his bishop. } Bc6 25. g5 {I felt that had he moved his h-pawn earlier, I would have found myself in a lot of trouble. So I kinda felt lucky I was able to pull this move and in a way neutralized or slowed his h-pawn progress.} Rcf8 26. Ne2 Rd8 {I gained tempo in those few last moves.} 27. Rh3 {So I am trying to attack something... anything, just to make me feel better. His rooks-bishop combo were dictating much of my play, so I felt I finally got the chance to attack.} d6 {I liked this move. In a way it almost felt as if he didn't have much choice but to push that pawn. He seemed stuck going back and forth with his rook and bishop. Something had to open up, and he was willing to sacrifice a pawn for it. Can't blame him.} 28. exd6 Rfd7 29. Rhd3 Bd5 {He was counting on this move, hoping to regain the loss pawn he just recently gave away. } 30. Nc3 {But i was not gonna let that happen, attacking his bishop. } Rd7xd6 {However, here I opt not to exchange with Bishop, since I feel that my Knight can become quite a force, if it ends up penetrating into higher ranks.} 31. Ne4 {I thought long and hard about this move (note that if: 31....Bxe4 32.Rxd6 Rxd6 33. Rxd6 and I come out ahead a point. There are few other exchange alternatives but every one of them in my favor)} Rc6 {He correctly chooses not to exchange.} 32. c3 Rc4 33. Nc5 {I wanted to put my Knight in action, and i felt if it gets up there, it will be able to start penetrating his defensive ranks and cause trouble. Currently attacking his a6 pawn, as well as e6 pawn (he can't take the Knight on e6 with the Bishop, uncovering his Rd8)} Rxd4 34. Rxd4 Ra8 {Forced. It protects the a6 pawn, as well as it moves the Rook away from the troubled d-file.} 35. Nd7 {But it's too late, my Knight becomes very strong.} h5 36. gxh6 e.p. gxh6 37. Nf6+ Kg7 38. Nxd5 exd5 39. Rxd5 {With that Knight putting so much pressure on his ranks, it was just a matter of time I would equalize pt differential.} h5 {I knew that that h-pawn will cause trouble sooner or later. I still think had he pushed it earlier he would have been better off. At this point I gotta get my King into action or it might be too late.} 40. Ke2 Re8+ {His rook had many options of attack. He could have attacked c-file, or f-file. He decided to grace my King with his attack. Thank you very much :)} 41. Kf2 Re6 42. f5 {Bad Move. I didn't see his next move.} Rf6 {Nice. Maybe simple, but I did not see it coming. I was blinded by the expected pawn exchange.} 43. Kf3 gxf5 {I am down again! At this point I am starting to lose my hope. I am starting to consider giving up and offering a draw. I don't feel like I am in danger of losing, but I sure am not in advantageous position. But I feel like I could pull a draw easy, as long as I don't make any blunders. I don't feel either like he will make any blunders, cause up to that point, he did not look like a player that makes blunders. The only reason I don't offer a draw is because it does me no good to my tourney aspirations.} 44. Kg3 {I want to keep an option to defend against any of his pawn pushes, so I get in the middle. } f4+ 45. Kf3 Kg6 46. Rd4 {I liked this move cause now I get the chance to involve my stale c-pawn} h4 {It did not look good for me. I can't take the f-pawn, cause after the rook exchange his h-pawn is Queening. I wanted to offer a draw, and maybe I luck out and he accepts. But still a draw does me no good for the tourney. So I keep playing. I am hoping for a miracle. He will Queen one of his pawns.} 47. c4 {Honestly, at this point, I am trying to distract him, and maybe get his rook away from the f pawn. Little did I know that this turned out to be a game turning move.} h3 {Ok, maybe it was that one, since he didn't take my c-pawn, but can you blame him? He is few moves away from Queening! I finally realize I can't stop him Queening one of his pawns. I am about 3 seconds from resigning, ... when all of sudden I see the following sequence of moves!!! I did not believe it until they actually unfolded: } 48. cxb5 h2 49. Kg2 f3+ 50. Kxh2 f2 51. Rd1 {I am sacrificing my rook! .... I actually foresaw all this, I felt pretty proud of that calculation. In other words I was tempo down, and a rook sacrifice away from restoring tempo balance in my favor.... although with a big piece disadvantage at that point, I am so close to Queening my pawns I feel gaining tempo is all I needed.} f1=Q 52. Rxf1 {There goes my homie. He sacrificed for the betterment of his nation. His deeds will be remembered for the generations to come...} Rxf1 53. bxa6 {At this point Queening cannot be stopped....} Rf7 54. b5 Ra7 55. b6 Rxa6 56. b7 Rxa5 57. b8=Q {I could not believe it... To this date the most significant win on this site, in so many ways.} Rg5 {But here I realize, even this is not straightforward. At one point I was struggling  figuring out how to finish it. Also, one of my Master level team members sent me a message with finishing set of moves for this game. I naturally refused to look until I finished it on my own. After the game I took a look at his suggestion and he said "Your game can easily be won with:........... " and then 30 moves later CHECKMATE!!!!  LOL...... In other words, this is not straightforward ending. One really has to work for the win.  This game me taught me the value of sticking with the game even when things look quite bleak. } 58. Qe8+ Kf5 59. Kh3 Rg7 60. Qf8+ Kg6 61. Qd6+ Kf7 62. Kh4 Rg1 63. Qd5+ Ke8 {After Ke8, the rook is gone with the following move:} 64. Qa8+ {any move by King is followed by Qa7   Here he finally resigned, and I moved on to the next round. Unfortunately for my stoic opponent he was half a point away from same. Hats off iamthundercat, great game, great battle, thanks for the wonderful chess experience. Wish you Good chess in the future....}
