1. e4 {This was a game where everything was decided in the seventh move. It looked like black used his queen, bishop and knight in a great combined attack, but white was able to counter it and everything fell apart for black after that.} Nc6 2. d4 {Black surrenders the center in the hope to attack it later. Ultramodern opening.} d5 3. exd5 Qxd5 {Rather than having the knight flee, black brings his queen into play very early in the game. This is rarely a good move.} 4. Nf3 Bf5 5. c4 {White tries to halt black's development - and consolidate the center - by attacking the queen.} Qe4+ 6. Be3 Nb4 {?? (weak move)  This seems like a good move. Black's next move would be Nc2. With double cover from the queen and the bishop, white is unable to stop the knight by putting its own bishop on d3.} 7. Qa4+ {!! (the deciding move of the game)  Black's last move left the king unguarded. Black has no chance but to retreat his knight to c6. Any other move would cost him the knight.} Nc6 8. Nc3 {White develops an extra piece. Black's attack is shattered.} Qg4 9. d5 {Since the knight on c6 is pinned, attacking it is the way to go.} Bd7 10. dxc6 Bxc6 11. Nb5 {White's queen is too well positioned. Rather than moving it, the knight on b5 blocks it, and poses another threat to c7.} O-O-O {Castling does bring the rook into play, but leaves black's queen's side hopelessly weak.} 12. Ne5 {Fork. In order to save his queen, black will have to sacrifice his defending bishop.} Qe6 13. Nxc6 bxc6 {This, of course, leaves black's defense even weaker. The b-file is now open, and a7 is undefended.} 14. Nxa7+ Kd7 15. Rd1+ {White wants to keep the pressure on.} Ke8 16. Rxd8+ {With a huge material and positional advantage, white can afford to trade a rook. It also leaves black with only one developed piece.} Kxd8 17. Nxc6+ Kc8 {Black chooses not to attack the knight with 17. Kd7, since 18. Nd4 (discovered check) would mean losing the queen.} 18. Na5 h5 {Black does not see the treat of Qe8#. Game over.} 19. Qe8# {}
