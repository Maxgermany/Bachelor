1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 {A classic opening - the Queen's Gambit Declined. White usually continues with Nc3.} 3. Nf3 b6 4. Bf4 {I think you should have anticipated Black's next move and played either cxd5 or e3.} Ba6 5. c5 {This loses a pawn without any compensation. You could have played either the simple 5.cxd5 or 5.e3 dxc4 6.Bxc4 Bxc4 7.Qa4  winning back the bishop.} bxc5 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Qa4+ Qd7 8. Qxd7+ Nxd7 {8...Kxd7 would have given Black the advantage. With the queens off the board the king would be in a strong position on d7.} 9. Bxc7 Rc8 10. Ba5 {Bg3 would have been better, in order to maintain control over the important square e5.} Ngf6 11. g3 {Too slow. You should have anticipated what was coming and played Nc3. The general rule says "knights before bishops".} Ne4 12. e3 Bb4+ {I think White could have resigned here!} 13. Nc3 Bxf1 14. Nd2 Bxa5 15. Nxf1 Nxc3 16. Nd2 Ne4 {}
