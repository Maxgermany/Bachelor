1. e4 {This is a game from the first round of the 37th GK tournament.   This is, I think, a good lesson in early development.  Let me know what you think.  } d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 {The Scandinavian or centre-counter attack.  I don't mind playing against this variation as white, since I think that developing the black Queen at this early stage allows white some initiative.  } 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. d4 c6 5. Bd2 Qd8 6. Nf3 {Already, white is way ahead of black in piece development.  } Bg4 7. h3 {Offering the D pawn for extra development and initiative...} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Qxd4 {...which black accepts.  } 9. O-O-O Qb6 10. Bc4 {Black is way off the pace here - he really needs some pieces to join his queen on the open board!} Nf6 11. Bg5 Nbd7 12. Bxf7+ {A nice way to win back the pawn and expose the black King} Kxf7 13. Rxd7 {The point of my temporary bishop sacrifice.  The rook cannot be recaptured by the black Knight as it is pinned.  } h6 {A mistake as this allows white's Queen into the attack} 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Qh5+ {Here she is!  } Kg7 16. Re1 {Threatening a nice sacrifice with Rxe7 , bxe7, Rxe7  leading to mate on f7 or g6.} Qb4 {Defending the e7 square but...} 17. Re4 {curtains!  White threatens either Rg4 , but in any event the black queen must now move from a dark square, allowing the capture on e7 and mate.  At this point, my opponent graciously resigned.  }
