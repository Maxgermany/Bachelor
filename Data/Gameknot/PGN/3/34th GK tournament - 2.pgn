1. e4 {This is one of the most epic games I've ever played. It was in the final round of the 34th GK tournament against the highest ranking player. The game features probably the best counter attack I've ever pulled off - recovering from a miserable situation caused by an opening blunder. The foundation of my counter attack was the recognition that I had enough tempo to be able to sacrifice pieces while still keeping white in an immensely dangerous position. In fact, once the counter attack began, the remainder of the game was spent with white on the defence. The result of the game was a very strange draw with plenty of pieces still remaining on the board.  I'm annotating this game in order to illustrate the importance of tempo and how one can apply the basic idea of tempo in order to turn a game around.} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {White is playing a very aggressive opening.} d6 4. d4 Bd7 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. O-O Be7 7. Bxc6 Bxc6 8. Qd3 {My next two decisions were pretty ill-judged and they set off white's attack which forces me to either experiment or lose.} exd4 9. Nxd4 Qd7 10. Nf5 {So here it is - the happy white knight jumps to F5 with a completely undefended area to play in; preparing to ruin my chances of castling and effectively putting me in a losing position already. When first seeing this, I kicked myself for not recognising how dangerous a position I was in a bit earlier. I realised that I could defend F8 with my king, but that would very quickly lead to a White queen on G3 and a push of the white pawns along the F and E file.   All in all, no matter how I positioned my king on the kingside, I would inevitably fall behind in development (with a trapped castle on H7 and a badly positioned King and Queen). I don't need to explain my predicament any further. It's pretty obvious that I'm in a lot of trouble.  I do have one advantage in this position however. I have more pieces in play - and therefore the advantage of tempo. The white knight and white bishop have both moved twice in the opening, meaning that 1: the knight is out of position - even if he has the advantage of an open attack on G2. 2: The white bishop took my knight early, allowing for the development of my white bishop - giving me two more 'tempi' (to use Nimzovitch's term) than white.  Lastly, notice how White's King is very poorly defended. My bishop has it's sights on G2 and my Queen is prepared to move to G4 once the knight gets out of the way. This led me to realise that G2 should logically be my target - even though a bishop and Queen alone are not enough to attack it.   This realisation gave birth to the counter attack which was realised in the following move...} O-O-O {The sacrifice of the G2 pawn. This not only tucks my king out of the way (giving me further tempo - since the knight will move a third time in order to gain material advantage), it prepares a very powerful counter attack which we shall see.} 11. Nxg7 Rhg8 {Suddenly I have put white in a very dangerous position. It will take a bit of time to work out exactly how this can lead to checkmate - there are plenty of variations, but essentially the idea is this: if the knight decides to move back to F5, the white castle sacrifices on G2. The next castle comes to attack the open king on G8 and white's E pawn is then taken by the knight - which, when re-taken by the white knight (Knight x E4) will be pinned by the white bishop on C5. The queen is always ready to jump to either G4 or H3.} 12. Bh6 {After this move, the position get's quite technical. I would appreciate any suggestions people might have on how I could have done better to capitalise on this. } Bf8 13. Qd4 Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Bxg7 15. Bxg7 f5 {I was very happy to suprise white with this nice little revealed attack, made all the more sweet because I actually planned for it.} 16. Bf6 fxe4 17. Qe3 Rdf8 {At this point black is in deep, deep trouble.} 18. Bh4 Rf3 19. Qxa7 Rxg2+ {And finally, I manage to initiate my sacrifice.} 20. Kxg2 Qh3+ 21. Kh1 b6 22. Qa6+ Kd7 23. Qc4 {Here I  drop the ball and allow white to narrowly escape checkmate.} e3 24. Bg3 Rxg3+ 25. Qxc6+ Kxc6 26. fxg3 Qe6 27. Kg1 {Now the game has completely changed - and 26 moves later (from move ...11), I still have the advantage of tempo.} e2 28. Rfe1 Qe3+ 29. Kg2 Kd5 30. a4 {This was literally the only way white could save himself from checkmate.} Qe4+ 31. Kf2 Qd4+ 32. Kxe2 Qxb2 {I decide to trade my black pawn for two white ones. Unfortunately, my next capture turns out to be the last in the game. The rest is spent trying to push my black pawns and force the white castles to trade with my Queen (using my king) which puts me 1 pawn ahead.} 33. Rac1 Qa2 34. Rcd1+ Kc6 35. Ke3 Qxa4 36. Re2 Qa3+ 37. Rd3 Qc5+ 38. Kd2 Qg5+ 39. Kd1 d5 40. Ree3 Kd6 41. h4 Qg4+ 42. Ref3 c5 43. Kc1 Qe6 44. Rde3 Qh6 45. Rf4 d4 46. Re8 Qg6 47. Rd8+ Ke5 48. Rf3 Qg4 49. Rdf8 h5 50. Rb3 Kd5 51. Rd8+ Ke5 52. Rb8 c4 53. Rb5+ Ke4 54. Rg5 Qe6 55. Rf8 d3 56. Rf4+ Ke3 57. Rgf5 Ke2 58. Rf4f2+ Ke3 59. Rf2f4 Ke2 60. Rf4f2+ {And that's it. Neither of us is willing to make any further attacks - because we are in a sort-of dual zugzwang.  I would appreciate any suggestions on how I could have finished black off at various points in this game.  All the same, I am very proud of this game as an illustration of the use of tempo and counterattack strategy.  Thanks for reading. Martin}
