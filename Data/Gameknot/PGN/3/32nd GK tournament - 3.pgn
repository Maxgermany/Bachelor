1. e4 {My preferred opening move.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {I was expecting Nc6 or Nf6.} 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 c5 {This move put me out of my opening book. } 5. Bb5+ {I decided to develop my light squared bishop. } Bd7 {Just what i was hoping for. The other possibility i was expexting was: 5 ... Nd7 6.Nf5 a6 7.Bd3} 6. Bxd7+ Nxd7 {I think Qxd7 was the better choice.} 7. Nf5 {Attacking the d6 pawn.} Nb6 8. Bf4 {One more attack on the d6 pawn.} d5 {Here I looked at exd5,Qxd5,Qxd5,Nxd5 and black seems to be ok.  I didn't like (for no good reason, I must admit) exd5, Qxd5, Qe2 , Qe6, Nc3, Qxe2 Nxe2. So I chose ..} 9. Nc3 {... to defend my e4 pawn and to develop another piece.} d4 {That was a mistake. Black didn't see what's coming next.} 10. Nb5 {Threatening to fork king and rook - Nc7.} Kd7 11. Nfxd4 {Clearing the way for the heavy metal! White is winning.} Qf6 {Not the best defence. But even Kc8, Nf5, Qxd1, Rxd1 looks grim for black.} 12. Qg4+ Kd8 {Other alternatives: 1. Ke7 Bg5 2. Ke8 Nc7  } 13. Bg5 {}
