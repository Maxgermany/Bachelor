[Opening "Reti opening (A04)"]

1. Nf3 {Reti opening. Supposedly the 4th common opening on GK. I can't stand king's pawn openings, and I can't play queen's pawn openings with the d4 move... so I prefer this opening.} e6 2. d4 Ne7 3. c4 d6 {I don't know if this was conservative playing or some sort of fool's check mate that I was missing.} 4. Nc3 b6 5. e4 {Since parizadeh isn't pushing past two spaces I decided to make an all out offensive play into the middle.} g6 6. d5 {Continuing the middle play control.} exd5 7. cxd5 Bg7 8. Nd4 {I choose to sack the knight to keep up with the complete control of the center...} Bxd4 9. Qxd4 {sucessful sack.} Ba6 {weird move, should of castled?} 10. Bxa6 {could have cut losses here by castling still...} Nxa6 11. Qxh8+ Kd7 12. Qd4 {opt not to take the queen in hopes of a faster checkmate (vs end game play).} Nc5 13. Na4 {Another sack to clear out black material} Nxa4 14. Qxa4+ {Sucessful sack} c6 15. dxc6+ Nxc6 16. O-O f5 17. e5 {bad pawn move on nickwan's part.} dxe5 {although it plays out with a bad take on parizadeh's part...} 18. Rd1+ Kc7 19. Rxd8 Rxd8 20. h3 Nd4 21. Qc4+ Nc6 22. Bg5 Rd4 23. Qc3 Rb4 24. Rc1 {doubling up!} Rd4 25. Qxc6+ {walking the plank.} Kb8 26. Qc7+ Ka8 27. Qc8# {}
