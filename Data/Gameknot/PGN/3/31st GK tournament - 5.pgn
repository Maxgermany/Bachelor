1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 {The so called Berlin defense or Berlin Wall, seldom seen at the highest level beacause of its strenght. Kramnik used it very often.} 4. O-O Nxe4 5. d4 {The indirect protection of the pawn.} exd4 {The pawn should not be taken. Best and normal its the theorical continuation 5.-...Nd5, and after 6.-Bxc6 dxc5 7.-dxe5 Nf5 8.-Qxd8 Kxd7 the debate its still on wheter black uncastled king and pawn weaknesses can survive white's onslaught defending with the power of the bishop pair.} 6. Re1 {The natural explotation of the open e file.} f5 7. Nxd4 {Threatening f3.} Nxd4 8. Qxd4 c6 9. Qe5+ {If 9.-Bc4 then d5 its good for black.} Qe7 10. Qxf5 {10.-Qxe7 Bxe7 11.-Bd3 d5 its good for black.} d5 {d6 was a better move.} 11. Qxd5 {The refutation of 10.-...d5} Bd7 12. Qxe4 {Winning a piece.} cxb5 {If 12.-Qxe4 Rxe4  13.-Be7 Bd3 wins a piece.} 13. Qxe7+ Bxe7 14. Bg5 {Can black do something now?} O-O 15. Bxe7 Rae8 16. Nd2 Rf5 17. Bb4 Rc8 18. c3 Bc6 19. Nf3 {White has clearly no objection in returning a pawn to exchange pieces.} Bxf3 20. gxf3 Rxf3 21. Re3 Rf5 {avoiding exchanges.} 22. Rae1 {Treathening to exchange rooks by 23.-Re8 } Rc6 23. Re3e8+ Kf7 24. Re1e7+ Kg6 25. Re7e6+ {white seeks exchanges.} Kh5 26. Re6e5 Rxe5 27. Rxe5+ Kg4 28. Rxb5 {Now white a pawn and a piece up confortably wins.} g5 29. Rxb7 {Make two pawns.} h5 30. Rxa7 h4 31. a4 Kh3 32. Re7 Rc8 33. a5 Rd8 {With the hopeful trheath 34.-Rd1 mate.} 34. Re1 Rd2 35. Ba3 {35.-a6 could have been triyed too, but i just wanted to play safe.} g4 36. a6 g3 37. hxg3 {Black resigned.}
