[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C62), old Steinitz defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening} d6 {Playable, but 3...a6 is more common.} 4. Bxc6+ {White should wait until the bishop is attacked before making the exchange. Better was 4.d4.} bxc6 5. c4 {This cedes control of d4 to Black. Better was  5.d4, threatening to win the Black e-pawn.} a5 {It would have been better to develop a piece! 5...Nf6 was the obvious move.} 6. d3 {By putting his centre pawns on white squares, White gives his remaining bishop plenty of freedom. But if that bishop ever gets exchanged, those black squares could become weak.} Nf6 7. O-O Be7 8. Nbd2 {Anticipating Black's next move perhaps.} Bg4 {You should have anticipated White's next move and played 8...0-0.} 9. Qa4 Qd7 10. b4 O-O 11. bxa5 {White has won a pawn, but, more importantly, he has created an open file.} Ra6 {Black should have seized control of the open file with 11...Rfb8.} 12. Bb2 {Giving Black another chance to seize the open file.} Rfa8 {The pawn is easily defended so these rooks are effectively out of the game. Rooks belong on open files!} 13. Bc3 d5 {A strong move, but you needed to arrange a defence for your e-pawn first.} 14. cxd5 cxd5 15. Qxd7 Nxd7 16. exd5 {White wins another pawn, but ruins his pawn structure in the process. 16.Nxe5 was much better.} Bf6 {A poor square for the bishop. Let White take the e-pawn! After 17.Nxe5 Nxe5 18.Bxe5 Rxa5 your rooks are back in the game. 16...Bf5 looks good to me.} 17. Rab1 Nc5 18. d4 exd4 19. Nxd4 Bxd4 {Bishops are better than knights in an open position like this. 19...Rd6 was an alternative way of winning a pawn back.} 20. Bxd4 Ra6xa5 21. Bxc5 {White obviously doesn't agree!} Rxc5 22. f3 Bf5 {22...Rxd5 was also possible.} 23. Rb2 Rxd5 {At this point I would have offered White a draw.} 24. Rc1 c5 25. Nc4 Rad8 {You should have anticipated White's next move and played 25...Be6.} 26. Ne3 Re5 27. Kf2 h6 {A wise move, but bad timing! 27...Bg6 was necessary.} 28. f4 Red5 {28...Re4 29.Nxf5 Rxf4  wins a pawn!} 29. Nxd5 Rxd5 30. Rc3 Be6 31. h3 Kh7 32. g4 f5 33. Kg3 c4 34. a3 fxg4 35. hxg4 h5 36. g5 Kg6 37. a4 Ra5 38. Ra3 Kf5 39. Rb5+ Rxb5 40. axb5 Ke4 41. b6 Bd5 42. Ra7 Kd3 43. Rc7 c3 44. b7 Bxb7 45. Rxb7 g6 46. Rc7 c2 47. f5 gxf5 48. g6 {}
