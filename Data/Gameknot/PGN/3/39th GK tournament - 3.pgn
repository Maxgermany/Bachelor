1. e4 {Standard opening, i was expecting something different but hey just playin chess.} e5 {I have played a couple 1600 players and they always seem to advance their pawns on me so I have to stop him from doing that, pretty normal.} 2. Bc4 {Just what I had expected, the old queen bishop mate.  Kind of an insult but i'm still cautious.} Bc5 {I wanted to start the pressure on his weak pawn.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 {I wanted to attack his queen with my bishop soon, so just getting ready for that.} 4. d3 d6 {g4 is looking good a bishop attack seemed obvious so i wanted to change it up a bit.} 5. f4 {i'm already hating his pawns, but i just wanted to work around them.} Ng4 {Here I was going to attack his queens bishop if he takes my bishop then I take with my knight and attack his queen. pretty strait forward.} 6. Nh3 {Here he gave me his knight.  i want to check him with my queen, if he blocks with g pawn then i take knight.  } Qh4+ {hoping to take a free knight.} 7. Kd2 {No give, so this is my favorite part of the game.  I knew that if I could get his feisty knight out of the way then I have mate shortly.  So i thought that i'd offer my knight for free because i'm only a "1220" player} Nf2 {I had to wait two days to see if he takes or not......} 8. Nxf2 {Oh baby!!  I was going nuts at this point.  Do you see it???  } Qxf4+ {POW!  he resigned at this point.  I hate it when i get a resignation when mate is only a move away.  what a bitch but, whatever.  e2 or e1 only legal move fatal when my black beauty takes his Knight.    Upon resignation Decebals said that i played strong for my rating, I think that he didnt play strong enough for his.  Only in this game, he killed me on the next one.  Either way, I think that the moral of the story is, if your opponent underestimates you, make sure that he regrets it.  I received 19.4 points with this win.}
