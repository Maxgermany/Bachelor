1. b3 d5 2. Bb2 {White starts with a fiancetto} Bf5 {No k-side development from black as of yet.} 3. d3 e6 {Connecting pawns opening for the bishop } 4. g3 {Getting ready for another fiancetto} h6 {Pointless move at this stage } 5. Bg2 Rh7 {Now that's just hideous } 6. Nf3 Nd7 {Maybe black was pressured about the time...} 7. O-O {White develops soundly ...} Be7 {Not good black should be thinking about castling queenside as the k-side is ruined } 8. c4 {Trying to get rid of the centre pawn.} Bf6 {Black ignores this and places an attack on the unprotected bishop } 9. d4 {Rather than retreat or exchange, white chooses to block with the pawn and gain a better position } Be4 {Of course, moving the pawn also allows e4 to be unprotected } 10. cxd5 Bxd5 {Clearing away the d pawn's centre control so now white has power on the fourth rank} 11. Qd3 {Bringing out her majesty and obviously attacking the somewhat pathetic rook} Rh8 12. e4 {Fighting for centre control and attacking black's bishop } Nc5 {Trying to retaliate. If dxc5 then ...Bxb2 winning the bishop and rook for a Knight and bishop. Still a mistake because...} 13. Qb5+ {...Qb5 winning the Knight } c6 {Mistake again. Now black compromises queenside pawn structure for castling} 14. Qxc5 Bxe4 {He gets a centre pawn for compensation } 15. Nbd2 {Driving him out } Bd5 16. Nc4 {White is thinking about slowly moving in...} Be7 {Black forces a queen exchange } 17. Qa5 Qxa5 18. Nxa5 Bb4 {He attack the Knight on the rim} 19. Nxb7 Nf6 20. a3 {Again pushing black away} Be7 21. b4 Rb8 {Attacking Knight which can move to covered areas } 22. Nc5 {Like c5 } Bxc5 23. dxc5 {If bxc5 then rook gets bishop } Ke7 {Connecting rooks or hoping to get a castled position by force } 24. Be5 {A nice place for the white bish} Rbc8 25. Bd6+ {Natural choice } Kd7 26. Ne5+ {Fits like a lock and key} Ke8 {No way to induce castling now! } 27. f3 h5 {Black decides to attack the k-side as his position is not really suitable for castling anyway. Position may have been OK if he played well but he was at a disadvantage } 28. Rfe1 h4 29. Nd3 {White prepares to capture pawn with the bish but loosens the grip around blacks king} hxg3 30. Bxg3 Nh5 {Attack that was waiting to happen } 31. Be5 f6 32. Bd6 g5 {Black presses on } 33. f4 Bxg2 {A sad day for Whites lsb who never really got any action from the sidelines...  :'(} 34. Rxe6+ {Exposed e pawn must be taken care of to reach the black kings lair } Kf7 35. Re7+ {The dsb has been very useful } Kg6 36. Kxg2 {Taking back the bishop. Now white is at +4} Nxf4+ {This means war } 37. Nxf4+ gxf4 {The board is looking more empty now } 38. Rg1 {The king can move out the way later rather than take the pawn first } Kf5 {This is foreseeable } 39. Rf1 {The black king looks vulnerable } Rcg8+ {Blaxk tries to get in first } 40. Kh1 Rg4 {Protection } 41. Re2 {Also protection but from h file attack} Rh3 42. Ref2 {F file attack. Battle of the rooks!} Rxa3 {Snapping up lone pawn} 43. Bxf4 {Strong griphold for white } Ke6 {Retreat!} 44. Re2+ {You can run but you can't hide...} Kf7 45. Be5 {...for long } Rxb4 {Hes getting greedy but its really causing problems for black -now a mate is coming up} 46. Rxf6+ {Here we go! There was less than 50 seconds left at this stage } Kg8 47. Rg2+ {No defenses left } Kh7 48. Rf7+ Kh6 49. Bg7+ Kh5 50. Rf5+ Kh4 51. Bf6+ Kh3 52. Rh5+ Rh4 53. Rxh4# {Hope you enjoyed! }
