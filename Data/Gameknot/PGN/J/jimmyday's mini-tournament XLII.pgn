1. e4 e5 {And there we are. A (what I call) copycat opening.} 2. Nf3 {I decide to develop and threaten.} f5 {He doubles his pawns, which is what I don't see very often. } 3. Nc3 {Developing.} Nf6 {And now he starts to develop.} 4. d4 d6 {The pawn formations take shape.} 5. Bd3 {Should have played Be2, as this restricts my queen. It happens a lot, watch for it. } Nc6 {And he realizes it.} 6. d5 {This was the best move I could think of.} Be7 7. dxc6 {And there is the first material blunder. A pawn for a knight. He wasn't paying attention.} bxc6 8. Bg5 Be6 9. O-O {Castling on kingside. } d5 {Tripled pawns and two on c row. His pawn formation begins to fall apart. } 10. exf5 {I take at f5, as if I did d6, he would sort out the c row.} Bd7 11. Qe2 {Nothing is protecting e5, so I could just take it.} e4 {But he both attacks f5 and forks me. A good move, but I am at a loss.} 12. Bxf6 {I decide to stall. } Bxf6 13. Bxe4 dxe4 14. Qxe4+ {And a check is in order, and his pawns are now obliviated.} Qe7 {Queen block.} 15. Qxe7+ Bxe7 {And now I am two pawns ahead, and I think we can agree that my formation is much better.} 16. Rae1 {Pin that bishop.} Bxf5 {He takes my f pawn.} 17. Re2 {Defence and offence!} Bxc2 18. Rxc2 {Again, another blunder. At this point I believe he was tired of this game.} O-O 19. Re2 {Try to regain a file.} Bd6 20. Rfe1 {It is mine now!} h6 21. g3 {Just in case of a attempted back rank.} Bb4 22. a3 Ba5 {And now he is doomed to a passive defence.} 23. b4 Bb6 {Bishop is just about useless now.} 24. Re2e6 c5 25. b5 {And now the bishop can only go to a5.} Ba5 26. Re1e3 {Break that pin!} c4 27. Ne5 {And now it gets intresting.} Rf5 {An attack to my knight. However, he forgets I will now just take the c pawn.} 28. Ng6 {Or will I?} Kh7 29. Nh4 {Attacking the rook.} Rff8 30. Ng6 Bb6 {And he gets his part in the action.} 31. Nxf8+ {But a check leaves him with nothing to show but a knight.} Rxf8 32. Nd5 Bxe3 33. Nxe3 {Still three points ahead, but the danger of the passed pawn looms.} c3 34. Rc6 Rc8 {But no more passed pawn.} 35. Rxc3 Kg8 36. Nf5 Kf7 37. Nd4 {Now I was thinking of a way to checkmate him. These rook/knight mates are always oh-so-hard to pull off.} g5 38. Rf3+ {I'll make him back off.} Kg6 39. Nc6 {A trick to make his rook move to a8. } Ra8 40. Ne7+ {And a check. He can't come forward to my knight, as my rook is blocking the f row.} Kh5 41. Kg2 {And we come in for the kill.} g4 {This is the final move for him.} 42. Rf5# {And another checkmate, ending this cool and fun game. The lesson of this game, I believe, is to make sure your pawns are set up correctly, and also to use them, not just to let them sit there, doing nothing. Well, anyway, thanks for viewing, and God Bless!}
