1. e4 {Typical.} d6 {Pirc Defence. I've played against this before, but I'm not too familiar with it.} 2. d4 e5 {Already out of openings book, but seems fine to me.} 3. dxe5 dxe5 4. Qxd8+ {Is this OK? I guess it throws black's castling opportunities away.} Kxd8 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. Bb5 {Development.} f6 {If I do Bxc6, Nxe5 afterwards no longer wins material. Would Bd6 have been better though?} 7. Bxc6 bxc6 {Trying to trade against strong opponents.} 8. O-O {Castles.} Bd6 9. Nc3 {Both knights out.} Ne7 10. Be3 {Was this OK?} c5 11. Rad1 {Pinned.} Ba6 {Was black's move OK?} 12. Rfe1 Rb8 13. Bxc5 {Free pawn.} Ke8 {Breaks pin.} 14. Bxd6 cxd6 15. Rxd6 {Gains material, but is this OK?} Rb6 {Probably not too good, as trading behind generally isn't a good idea.} 16. Rxb6 axb6 {End of the bloodshed.} 17. Nd5 Nxd5 18. exd5 {More trading.} Ke7 {Maybe he was hoping to kill pawn.} 19. Rd1 Rd8 {Putting pressure on d5, but the pawn is still safe.} 20. Nh4 {Hoping to do Nf5, forcing the black king to move further away from the pawn. Were there better options?} Bc4 {Pawns forked.} 21. d6+ {Check. Would this normally be OK?} Rxd6 {?? Loses a rook.} 22. Nf5+ {He resigned here. Feel free to comment and give constructive criticism.}
