1. e4 {Dance of The Fools  Well this was an eccentric one, with an early advantage I still did my best to make a mess but managed to cling on....} e5 2. f4 {I'm not good with this opening, not good with most openings.} exf4 3. d4 Qh4+ {Yes I know chess theory, well at least as far as early queen moves aren't a good idea.} 4. g3 fxg3 5. Nf3 g2+ 6. Nxh4 gxh1=Q {Now here with an early advantage I got a bit complacent.} 7. Qe2 Be7 8. Bf4 Bxh4+ 9. Kd2 Nf6 10. Nc3 O-O {Too busy developing to spot what was happening.} 11. Rd1 Re8 12. Bg2 {Until this point. Nicely played by my opponent but tbh I was completely oblivious.} Qxd1+ 13. Kxd1 d5 14. Kc1 Nc6 15. Qd3 Re7 16. e5 Nh5 17. Be3 g6 18. Bxd5 Nb4 19. Qc4 Nxd5 20. Nxd5 {Now at this point white has almost complete control of the centre and I'm starting to panic.} Rd7 21. Nxc7 Rb8 22. e6 Re7 23. exf7+ Kf8 24. Bh6+ Ng7 25. Bxg7+ Kxg7 26. Qd5 Rxf7 {I think I got off lightly there.} 27. Qe5+ Kh6 28. Ne6 Bxe6 29. Qxb8 Bg5+ 30. Kd1 {I'd been hoping for k-b1, r-f1 mate} Re7 {But lets try it another way and see if he notices...} 31. Qxa7 Bg4# {And he didn't! After move 25 it seemed I managed to cope with the pressure, doubtless there were other lines that white could have followed, but glad I managed to survive that one!}
