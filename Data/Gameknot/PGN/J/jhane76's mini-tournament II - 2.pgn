1. e4 {Who Needs Queens Anyway?  Another example of planning ahead and forgetting to check at each step of the way.} e5 2. Nf3 Qf6 3. Nc3 h6 4. Nd5 Qd8 5. Bc4 Ne7 6. d3 Nxd5 7. Bxd5 c6 8. Bb3 f6 9. d4 Qa5+ 10. Bd2 Bb4 {Despite the attack very confident at this point. } 11. c3 Bd6 12. dxe5 fxe5 {Probably should have used to bishop to counter-take.} 13. O-O h5 14. Ng5 {Just exploring, no real plan in mind. Hoping for an exposed on the queen, but got to time it right.} Rf8 15. Qxh5+ Kd8 16. Rad1 {Protecting the potential exposed attack on the queen.} Be7 17. c4 Qc5 18. Bc3 d6 19. a3 {Can't rem why I did that, must have been a reason. Well actually with me there may well not have been.} Bxg5 20. Qxg5+ Kc7 21. Qe7+ {Oooh lovely, bishop in the way or king moves and I snaffle the rook yeah?} Nd7 {Ok, so its the knight I'll still snaffle the rook right?} 22. Qxf8 Nxf8 {No. Ah. Oops. Now that wasn't part of the plan.} 23. Bb4 {Lets harass and see what happens.} Qb6 {I'm such a lucky Panda. When I check with my next move the king is forced onto the d file...} 24. Bxd6+ Kd8 25. Bc5+ {And then I can pull a nasty trick like that on my unfortunate opponent.} Bd7 26. Bxb6+ axb6 27. f4 Ne6 28. fxe5 c5 29. Rd6 Nc7 30. Rfd1 {Now I'm being nasty. Relief always makes me want to maim, kill, slaughter. I'm a kind gentle soul in life. Honest.} Ke7 {Probably e8 would have been better.} 31. Rd6xd7+ Ke6 32. Rxc7 Rb8 33. Rd6+ {Sac the e pawns to grab the b pawns and with a considerable advantage now I felt guilty enough about my somewhat aggressive tendencies to offer a draw. Which my opponent thought long and hard about before accepting *lol* they were probably hoping I'd have another brainfart!}
