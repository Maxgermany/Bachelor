[Opening "French defence (C00)"]

1. e4 {kings pawn opening} e6 {French defence } 2. Nc3 {yes, I know I should do d4 but I am terrible at the exchange and advanced variation(you don't care-lol)} f5 {his weird move hence the name of this game-trying to transpose to a dutch} 3. Nh3 {I am preparing for a gambit} fxe4 {i was right} 4. d3 {getting bishop out to d3} exd3 {took the bait} 5. Bxd3 {i am up in compensation: 3 pieces active for a pawn} g6 {blocked my plan on getting the queen out} 6. Bg5 {plan-B} Nf6 {bishop e7 would've been better} 7. Qf3 {more pressure} Be7 {bg7 was worse due to Ne4} 8. Nf4 {pressure on g6} d5 {could've castled but I would knight sac on g6 and earn the rook later} 9. O-O-O {i did a passive move like him} Nc6 {he thinks his defense is stable but nxg6-the rook backs up the h file} 10. Bxf6 {trade} Bxf6 {can you see my next move} 11. Ncxd5 {You-Only-Live-Once} exd5 {ok expected} 12. Nxd5 {f6 is pressured} Rf8 {cant castle either because of Nxf6 then bishop C4 check (Rxd8 kills the queen)} 13. Nxf6+ {true epicness} Rxf6 {if the queen took rook e1+ compensation I think} 14. Bxg6+ {discovered attack} hxg6 {blunder} 15. Rxd8+ {self explatory} Kxd8 {I would've took with knight} 16. Qxf6+ {self explanatory} Ne7 {not many alternatives here} 17. Rd1+ {he pretty much lost} Bd7 {I missed checkmate but he admit defeat-the weirdest game of the century(in my opinion)he was a worthy foe indeed}
