1. d4 {Like so many, I was an avid chess player in high school and college, but gave it up entirely until later in life. In my younger days, I played 1. e4 exclusively. Back then I had time to keep track of the myriad defenses that Black can use. At this stage of life, its just not worth the effort. It is true that there are a lot of defenses to 1. d4 but the positions tend to be more similar and morph into one another more easily than the 1. e4 games.} Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 {I have had more trouble with 3. ... d5, which usually leads to a more unbalanced position than the King's Indian. I have not faced the Grunfeld enough to feel confident yet that I know how to deal with it. In the handful of Grunfelds I have played as White, my most smashing success was with the wild and crazy 4. g4, but this was only because my shocked opponent blundered almost immediately.} 4. e4 d6 5. f3 {My first attempt with the Saemisch. This move never made much sense to me; White neglects development to make yet another pawn move and takes away the most logical square for his King's Knight. Initially I tried the seemingly more natural 5. Nf3 against the K's Indian, but I was not satisfied with the resultant positions. Black seems able to complete his development unproblematically and eventually play ... e5 or ...c5, chipping away at White's pawn center and thus achieve the main goal of the K's Indian. So for a while I switched to 5. f4 which got better results, but only through luck in my opinion. 5. f3 supports the center better than 5. f4 and while it is not a developing move, it aims at hindering Black's natural development by taking away the g4 square from the King's Knight (should White decide to play Be3) or the Queen's Bishop (should White decide to play Nf3).} O-O 6. Be3 Nc6 {This is not the only option, of course. The database I use gives ... e5 as the most played move here, followed by the text, ... Nbd7, and ... c5. I like either ... e5 or ... c5 here, as I think Black has to hit White's strong center right away. At least in this game, Black did not have the luxury of leisurely development! ... c5 of course can involve a pawn sacrifice, but Black's results seem to be good.} 7. Nge2 {The other main possibility is 7. Qd2, but I figured: why commit the Queen just yet? There is only one reasonable square for the Knight, so let's move it first and see what Black does.} a6 {According to the DB, the most played move, but it seems dreadfully slow to me. I prefer an immediate hit on the center with ... e5. If White responds 8. d5, then after ... Na5, 9. Ng3 (or Nc1), c5, Black has achieved his opening goals.} 8. Qd2 Re8 {This is an attempt to preserve the KB (If White should play Bh6 Black can retreat to h8 without losing his KR). Yet surely it is way too slow? Black can still play ...e5 here and answer d5 with Na5, as on the previous move. Even ... Rb8 seems preferable. True, in this case White can force the exchange of Black squared Bishops, but one wonders if this is worth facing the possibility of ... b5.} 9. O-O-O Rb8 10. h4 b5 11. h5 Na5 {Probably ... Nxh5 was preferable, because after the pawn exchange hxg6 fxg6, the e6 square becomes dreadfully weak. After 11 ... Nxh5; 12. g4 Nf6; I was planning 13. Ng3, to be followed with Qh2 and g5. However Kanko vs. Graeffe (Finland 1991) continued 13. Nd5 bxc4; 14. Nxf6+ exf6; 15.Nc3 Na5 16.Qh2 and Black was crushed.} 12. Nf4 {With an eye not only on h5, but also e6 which is about to become weak.} Nxc4 13. Bxc4 bxc4 14. hxg6 fxg6 15. g4 c6 {This is better than 15 ... Nd7?? 16. Ne6! 1-0 as actually occurred in Stake Larsen vs. Sorseth (Gausdal 1999). Nevertheless, ... g5 is much better. Black does not seem to understand what trouble he is in.} 16. Qh2 Qb6 {In view of what happens, perhaps it would have been better for Black to accept the loss of a piece with 16 ... g5; 17 e5, h6; 18. exf6, exf6; 18 Ng2} 17. g5 Nh5 18. Nxh5 gxh5 19. Rd2 e5 {Finally! Of course, it's way too late.} 20. Qxh5 Be6 {20... Re7 would have held out a bit longer.} 21. d5 Qxe3 22. dxe6 Re7 {Of course, Black would love to take the pawn, but that runs into 23. Qxh7+ Kf7 24. Qf5+ Ke7 25. Rh7 Qe1+ 26. Rd1 Qe3+ 27. Kb1 with the dual threat of Rxg7 and Nd5+} 23. Nd1 Qf4 24. Rh4 Qg3 25. Qxh7+ Kf8 26. Qf5+ Kg8 {This runs into a quick mate. Amazingly, my computer tells me that Black can survive to an endgame, albeit a piece down via this route: â€¦ Ke8 27. Qg6+ Kd8 28. Rh7 Bf8 29. Rxd6+ Kc7 30. Rxe7+ Kxd6 31. Rd7+ Kc5 32. e7 Bxe7 33. Rxe7 Qf4+ 34. Kb1 Rd8 35. Nc3 Rd2 36. Na4+ Kd4 (not ... Kb4 as Black gets mated). I find it hard to believe that there isn't an improvement for White in this line.} 27. Rdh2 c3 28. Qg6 {The idea is to pin the Black KB, threatening Rh8++} cxb2+ 29. Kb1 {Black resigns. He can stave off immediate mate by giving up his Queen for a rook, but then he cannot stop Rh7 followed by N-e3-f5.}
