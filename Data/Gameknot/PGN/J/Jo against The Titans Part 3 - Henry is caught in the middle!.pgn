1. e4 {Hi everyone!  I have just been informed by Gameknot that this is my 6th anniversary of joining gameknot - doesn't time fly!  To date this is my first completed match in my third mini-tournament against the Titans.  As my rating has climbed I am progressively taking on opponents with ratings which lean towards GM Level.  Here I am playing against IM Klauno (Klaus).  In this game, I chose a rare line of the French Defense which would lead to open play.  I thought that it would help me overcome passivitis which has been my millstone around my neck, particularly against the higher rated players for many years.  Things seemed OK and then I developed the wrong knight.  This seemingly natural move led to Henry being trapped in the centre where he perished.  So how did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board?bd=18563548&fb=1&rnd=0.9507084005361646.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 e5 {4. ...... e5 - this is the unusual move leading to the open play.  It looks sound but as you will see it will have its drawbacks.} 5. Nf3 exd4 6. Bc4 {6. Bc4 - a gambit of a pawn to increase his lead in development.} Nf6 {6. ..... Nf6? - a developing move at last but the wrong one!  Klaus said I should have moved the other knight out instead.  Klaus' reply hits at the f7 pawn.  Glenda decided to put the question to the WK but this exacerbated the problem because Fou Lenoir is boxed in.} 7. Neg5 Qe7+ 8. Kf1 {8. Kf1 - Klaus is prevented from castling but he has a way of showing me that this is no hardship for him.} Be6 {8. ...... Be6 - I try to develop and defend f7 at the same time but alas this move does not cut the mustard.} 9. Nxe6 fxe6 {9. ...... fxe6 - this N for B trade opens up the e8-h5 diagonal.  The Wicked Witch of the West will soon exploit this opening.} 10. Nxd4 {10. Nxd4 - now Klaus regains his pawn with threats against the e6 pawn and the h5 square.} e5 11. Ne6 {11. Ne6 - a fatal crimp on Henry.} Nc6 {11. ..... Nc6 - this clears the decks on the queenside but Henry cannot castle queenside because the d8 square is attacked by that wretched steed and the Witch!} 12. Bg5 h5 {12. .... h5 - trying to stop the Witch getting to h5, but Klaus now warns me she is bound for g6.  I manage to delay this by advancing my pawn to e4 but Klaus finds another way to increase the pain.} 13. Qd3 e4 14. Qg3 {14. Qg3 - like this.  Not only that, my pawn on c7 is under fire so I defend it with Rc8.  I recall a comment Coach Ion made about The Dentist's position in my last game against me.  Ion quoted this "White's game is now finely balanced: weak on the king side and equally weak on the queenside.  That white's centre is looking pretty wobbly completes the picture.  Yup, that describes my (black's position to a tee!).} Rc8 15. Rd1 {15. Rd1 - making d7 unavailable to Henry should he have any ideas about Castle by Hand.} Na5 {15. .... Na5 - trying to force off Klaus' dangerous lsb for my knight.} 16. Bxf6 Qxf6 17. Nxc7+ Rxc7 18. Qxc7 {18. Qxc7 - after exchanging his dsb for my king knight white wins the exchange.  But that is only for starters.  I would have also been a whole rook down because Be7 was the only way to avoid immediate mate.  Rather than resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material I simply allowed sudden death on the next turn.  So that is Game 1 lost and although Game 2 against The Brigadier was a marginal improvement, I still managed to get Fou Leblanc trapped and found another way for Henry to cop Old Matey.  However, despite this loss and the other two losses I am about to annotate, I am keeping my chin up - cheers and bye for now - Joanne} Nxc4 19. Qd7# {}
