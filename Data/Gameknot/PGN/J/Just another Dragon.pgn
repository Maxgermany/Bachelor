[Opening "Sicilian (B78), dragon, Yugoslav attack, 10.O-O-O"]

1. e4 {I've seen a couple annotated Dragons lately. Here's one I played recently. I think this game is quite interesting in terms of positional compensation and piece activity against material.} c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {A little thoughts about the Dragon; Some people seem to think that it's not sound against best play unlike some other openings, but I think it's perfectly playable at all levels of chess. I agree that White's plan is easier to adopt than blacks, but it makes no difference of the objective assesment of the opening.  I do think that the opening is rather one-sided, and I'm going to take some other openings against 1.e4 on my repertoire aswell. I've had bad score against the Scheveningen, so maybe I should experiment that line.} 6. Be3 Bg7 7. f3 {Yugoslav Attack. The most aggressive and probably the most critical test of black resources. White strenghtens his center, preparing to castle long, advance his h-pawn and checkmate down the h-file. Some games are this simple, actually.} O-O 8. Qd2 Nc6 {I like to think that this knight's job is to force White make some sort of concessions at the queenside. Whether it is to give up the useful light-squared bishop (and so weaken the light squares) or to distrup the pawn formation or something else, something for black to attack.} 9. Bc4 {The most agressive variation. The pin on the f7-pawn might turn useful if white plays h4-h5xg6, because black would like to answer fxg6 keeping the h-file closed and to clear escape route for the king. It also defends the queenside lightsquares and prevents the move d5. However, the minus side of this bishop move is linked with loss of time. It is forced to move to b3 and many times equally forced to trade itself to a knight landing on c4. Thus some players prefer 9.0-0-0 d5 but it it mostly matter of taste.} Bd7 {Making room for rook to come to f8. The bishop is not very happy on this square, but there is no better square right now. } 10. O-O-O Rc8 {Ideally black would like the other rook to come to f8, but there is no fully acceptable square for the queen right now. There is a notoriously sharp variation 10...Qa5 but the modern theory seems to dislike this move. } 11. Bb3 {A common theme - there is no immediate threat against the bishop, but he will have to retreat it sooner or later so white mantains maximum flexibility with the text.} Ne5 {On a way to c4 to weaken the queenside - altough in some variations the knight stays at e5, controlling important central squares. That is not so common though.} 12. h4 {White starts the thematic h-pawn hack} h5 {A big decision for black. I played this move at the first time in this game, mostly because I've had more problems breaking this formation as white than those where black allows the move h5. It's a little suspicious to play at the side of board where your opponent is stronger though...  I remember that I once read John Nunn writing something like that there are two ways to play the Dragon (or was it about all positions with opposite-side castling...) , the safe and the attacking way. The other is to use minimum amount of preventive moves on the side you are defending and use every possible tempo to attack on the other side - and this is the safe way! The other way is to completely ingore the opposite attack and trust that you are the one qho checkmates faster.   It seems that black is now playing the "safe" way.} 13. Bg5 {Aggressive, once again. Now white is ready to remove the f6-knight and he is not forced to trade the LSB for black knight. } Rc5 {Black immediately exploits the square white has left without control. Sergei Karjakin once wrote on his blog something like: It's easy to win with the Dragon. Just move your rook to c5, sacrifice it to anything that comes to the fifth rank, pick up pawn(s) and win the endgame. Sometimes things may be that simple...} 14. g4 {It looks like black is getting blown of the board! However, it is not so easy. Good bless the open c-file black obtained at move 4. White have to work for those!} hxg4 {I think this is the best move, altough black wouldn't like to play at the kingside. If the pawn is left at g4, it might somewhat cramp White's attack.} 15. f4 {Preparing to blast trough the kingside. Note that White doesn't really win tempo because it merely forces black to make a move he wanted to do anyway.} Nc4 16. Qe2 {No reason to give up the LSB, not yet.} Qc8 {The knight must be defended, but there are other purposes too. Obviously black likes to increase firepower on the f-file, and at c8, unlike at the natural square c7, the queen lends support to the g4-pawn too.} 17. f5 {Thematic. Now black sees no reason to react, so he tries to force White to waste some time on the queenside.} Nxb2 {This looks like a pseudo sacrifice, but it all boils down to a familiar Dragon exchange sacrifice.} 18. Kxb2 {Now here a move like 18.fxg6 must never be forgotten. After 18...Nxd1 white can deliver check with pawn or bishop, but after 19.fxf7  Kh8 or 19. Bxf7  Rxf7 20.gxf7  Kf8 There are several hanging white pieces and black gains free hand to operate at the queenside. Black king looks airy but there are no quick ways to kill. I don't remember what I had prepared to it at the time of this game.... Maybe I should Fritz the position. } Rxc3 19. fxg6 Rxb3+ {And so black finally gets rid of the white LSB, at the cost of an exchange. Not many other possibilities here, though. The white king gets a bit airy and now Black is constantly looking ways to exploit it.} 20. cxb3 {There is something to be said about axb3 as White does not seem to be interested in challencing the c-file...} fxg6 {Now black has, somewhat superficially, actived his other rook. However, the f-file turns out to be a good highway to action and the rook now has an ideal square on his mind - f2.} 21. Qe3 {This might be a minor mistake. I think 21.Rc1 would've been more awkward move to meet.} Qc5 {Interesting possibilities here; 21...Nxe4 is worth analysing. If white captures, then after ...Rf2  blacks attack would most probably crash trough. But I couldn't see anything acceptable after the simple 22.Rc1, so I decided to renew the threat while activating the queen. Now White takes blacks word and makes a preventive move.} 22. Kb1 {One gets a feeling that there should be something better here...} Qa3 {Once again renewing the threat; now it is 23...Nxe4 24.Qxe4 Bf5 when the queen is a goner since the d4-knight is pinned against checkmate on b2.} 23. Bh6 {Now white decides to act on the kingside deciding to answer ...Nxe4 with Bxg7 with complications that are far too hard to analyze for me.} Nxe4 {Black steps bravely into the action. With this move black is willing to sacrifice at least a piece, in some lines even more.} 24. Bxg7 {It is not the calculating task that is hard but some positions just are not easy to asses. This is clearly the best move in this situation, removing the "checkmate-pin" of the knight.} Rf2 25. Nc2 {Now it looks like black runs out of steam, he is down on material and the queen is threatened. } Bf5 {Jacob Aagaard, one of my favourite chess authors once established a "90% rule"  - 9 times out of ten the move you want to make for positional reasons works out tactically, too. So, black wants his whole army to work together and this is clearly the best square for this bishop. So we can forget such minor tactical problems as a hanging queen. It is still not sure if blacks gamble work out - he is down a rook for three pawns. However, the activity of black forces and the incoming pin of the knight will give him such a pressure on whites position that (or that is what he trusts) black will win atleast an exchange back and then have three pawns for the exchange - two of them doubled and isolated, though.  I would like to add that this sort of move is very, very hard to resist. It is so aesthetically pleasing that black felt that he must try it. That is probably why he played 23...Nxe4 in the first place.} 26. Bb2 {Clearly the best. 26.Nxa3 Nc3   27.Kc1 Nxa2# or 27.Ka1 Rxa2#} Qc5 {Queen exchange is no problem for black, there is other goals for an attack than a checkmate. All his pieces are better than their white counterparts and he has a nice bind on white, not to mention the two central pawns that may turn into a great force in a endgame. One gets the feeling that white's extra rook is not doing everything it can...} 27. Qxc5 Nxc5 {Now it becomes clear that white cannot mantain all of his material lead. He must now decide the best way to give up the exchange back.  It is suprising how active all black pieces became. Not the same can be said about white pieces, the b2-bishop looks nice, but without other pieces it does nothing. The knight is doomed to a poor square and the rooks can't do much right now. Lead in developement is not, however, a permanent advantage, so black must do something with it.} 28. Rdc1 {Of course it's not necessary to lose a whole piece.} Nd3 29. Rcf1 Re2 {White knight cannot move and black threatens ...Nxb2. White decides to get rid of the suprisingly active black bishop.} 30. Rxf5 gxf5 {So black has three pawns for a bishop. White has a passer and now his rook is in a good position, but black has four (!) connected passed pawns. The game is not over yet, but now it sure looks like black has the advantage - his rook and knight are better than white's so the question is: can the pawns overcome the bishop?} 31. Bc3 {If the bishop goes, then it's all over for black. Knights are not as good against pawns as bishops.} f4 {Passers must be pushed, as the say...} 32. Nd4 Rg2 {Black wants to keep the white king immobilised and out of the pawns way. The activation of the black king is tricky, too, because if it runs too far away the white h-pawn may run through.} 33. Ne6 {White cannot allow ...e5. This is good square for the knight and now he must try to make some play connected with the advance of the h-pawn. Note that now all white pieces expect the king are able to help the h-pawn, so black must act quickly.} f3 34. Bd4 f2 {If black is allowed to play ...g3 and ...Rh2 things are starting to get miserable for white.} 35. Bxf2 {But are things really this desperate? Now the game turns into a Rook and knight endgame with two extra pawns for black, not to mention the superior rook. In my notes I had this line: 35.Ng5 Nf4 36.Ne4 Nh3!? It is a long time ago since I analysed this, since at this point my opponent started using all the 5 days for every move, maybe waiting my rating to rise (his rating had gone up to 1830 or something) so he would not lose so many points.  35.Ng5 is at least something active. If black does nothing, white simply advances his h-pawn to victory. Now 35...g3 36.Nf3 locks the rook out forever, so 35...Nf4 looks best. After 36.Ne4 Nh3!? black threatents to win a bishop with Rg8  or force the bishop out of the long diagonal with ...e5, ...d5 and ...d4. It's not clear if wghite can do anything for that.  } Rxf2 {This should be a matter of technique, altough I'm not sure about mine.} 36. Rg1 Ne5 37. h5 Kh7 38. Ng5+ Kh6 39. Ne4 Rf8 {Black is now playing "safe" moves and intends to place his rook behind the passers.} 40. Ng3 Nd3 {Black now wants to get rid of white's last hope, the h-pawn. After that he can squeeze the win without worrying some random runners on the edge of the world.} 41. Kc2 Nf4 {The plan is to swing rook to g5.} 42. Rf1 e5 43. Ne4 {Does this move really have a purpose?} d5 {These pawns are starting to look scary... This central pawn majority was one of blacks advantages he gained at move three!} 44. Ng3 Rg8 45. Rh1 Rg5 46. Rf1 {White decides to prepare Nf5 .} Nxh5 47. Nf5+ Kg6 {Blunders a pawn. Surely Kh7 was better?} 48. Ne7+ Kg7 49. Nxd5 g3 {Black wants to tie white forces with the passers. The he will have more room to maneuvre } 50. Ne3 Nf4 51. Rg1 g2 52. Kd2 Kf6 {The king comes. At last.} 53. b4 {White is running out of moves.} b5 54. a3 a6 {Black knows that the greater rook mobility will ensure him the privilige to "waste" a move if he wants to. These pawn moves are to take that away from white.} 55. Ke1 {Unfortunately for black the king cannot come to f2 due ...Nh3 } e4 {Making room for the king.} 56. Kd2 Rg3 {Suddenly white has no moves. All knight moves allows Nh3, king moves drops the knight and rook moves of course drops the rook. This leaves 57.a4 and white didn't want to face another passer. He resigned.  I would like to thank my opponent for the game and apologize about the bad language I've been writing. English isn't my native language after all. And please, leave comments and rate the game! :) It's nice to have feedback for annotations.}
