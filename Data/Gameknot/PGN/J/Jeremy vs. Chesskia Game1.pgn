1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 {My opponent opted for a queens gambit declined. The next few moves are common book opening moves} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e3 O-O 6. Nf3 h6 7. Bh4 {Maintaining the tension on his knight until he forces my hand} Ne4 8. Bxe7 Qxe7 9. Qc2 {taking the strong diagonal} Nxc3 10. Qxc3 {I haven't decided if queen takes or pawn takes is better. Sometimes I like taking with the pawn, so it prevents knight manuevers to b4} dxc4 11. Bxc4 {taking the pawn with tempo} Nd7 12. O-O c5 {trying to break down control of D4} 13. Rfe1 {adding to control the e file} cxd4 14. exd4 Rd8 15. d5 {putting more pressure on his e pawn, which is pinned} Nb6 16. dxe6 {At this point, I think it would have been better to back up the bishop and keep the tension on his e-pawn} Nxc4 17. Qxc4 {Had to take the knight, because if I tried to sneak another pawn with e takes f7, he could recapture with the queen and guard his knight and be up a piece} Bxe6 18. Qa4 Qf6 19. Rab1 {I should have just moved my pawn up, now I am going to be down a pawn} Bf5 20. Rbd1 Rxd1 21. Rxd1 Qxb2 22. Re1 Be6 {closing the e file} 23. a3 a5 24. Nd4 b5 25. Nxb5 Bd7 26. Qe4 Rb8 27. Nd6 Be6 28. Qe3 Rb3 29. Qa7 Qe5 {threatning a back rank mate if I take his queen} 30. Qa8+ Kh7 31. Qe4+ Qxe4 32. Nxe4 Rxa3 33. Nc5 Bf5 34. h3 Rc3 35. Na4 Rc4 36. Ra1 Bd7 37. Nb6 {This move sealed the draw as I would win the h pawn after the exchanges on d7} Rc7 38. Nxd7 Rxd7 39. Rxa5 Rd1+ 40. Kh2 {}
