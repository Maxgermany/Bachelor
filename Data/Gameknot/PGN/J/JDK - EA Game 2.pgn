1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5 4. c3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Qb6 6. a3 {This is a very common move for white.} Bd7 {a5 would have been a better move here.} 7. b4 c4 {Locking out the pawns. Until someone makes a breakthrough, the centre will be static.} 8. Be2 a5 9. bxa5 Rxa5 {At this point, taking with the rook I think is the best idea. The idea being to tuck the a8 rook in behind once development is complete. } 10. O-O {A good move. Castling is a good idea for white.} h6 11. Re1 Nge7 12. Bf1 Nf5 13. Re2 {This is a very good move. The rook can attack on the b file  or protect on the a file shortly.} Be7 {Continuing development. Blacks white-squared bishop is the weakest minor piece as it is not really doing much at the moment.} 14. Rb2 {white goes for the attack.} Qa6 15. Rba2 Na7 {7Sep06 - Have been checking this position for quite a while now.  a3 is protected by no less than 4 pieces. The idea behind Na7 is to relocate it to b5 where it is attacking the pawns on a3 and c3. However, before that I should prevent the pawn from reaching a4 by Ba4, attacking the queen in the process.} 16. Ne1 Ba4 17. Nc2 {The bishop on a4 is proving handy for black. If it was not there then there would be Nb4 pretty soon.. Attacking the black queen and making inroads into blacks position via b4->c6 (eventually). However if Nb4 then Bxd1. } Nb5 {Attacking the pawns on c3 and a3. Note Bb2 will have a response of Bb3 claiming the rook on a2 because it has blocked its escape routes.} 18. Qd2 Bb3 19. Rb2 Kd7 {01Nov06 - Freeing up the rook to come to a8 if needed. Whites queenside is looking very cluttered. Possibly the critical position. White has some possibilities, his queen is quite free. There are no attacks on his king. Blacks knight on f5 does not really have many escape options and the f7 pawn could become weak later. For now it is an all out attack of whites pieces!} 20. g3 h5 21. Bh3 g6 {Further protection to the knight.} 22. Qf4 {The tide is turning and white is now making use of the extra space on the kingside. Even so white cannot move too much material the kingside just yet. } f6 23. exf6 Bxf6 24. Bxf5 gxf5 25. Nb4 Qb6 26. Qe3 h4 27. Nd2 {In freeing the knight to attack the bishop and also with the possibility of moving to f3, applying pressure on the h4 pawn, it leaves its guard of the a3 pawn.} Nxa3 {Black duly accepts the offer of the pawn, knowing that it may be a short term thing.} 28. Nxb3 {? That white squared bishop was not doing much. Black is compelled to take the knight. } cxb3 {20Nov06 - if white takes then b3 pawn then 29. ... Nc4 attacking the queen and also allowing Rxa1 possibilities. If 29. c4 then 29. ... Nxc4 forking the rook and the queen. Maybe the best possibility for white is 29. Nxd5? White is now thinking for time over this move.   20Nov06 - Update - White resigns. }
