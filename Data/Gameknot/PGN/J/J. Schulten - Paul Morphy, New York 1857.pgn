1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 {Morphy was never one to accept gambits...} 3. exd5 e4 {The Falkbeer Counter-Gambit, the evaluation of which remains not altogether clear even to this day} 4. Nc3 {More is promised by 4.d3 Nf6 (4...Qxd5 5.Qe2, or, as suggested by Keres, 5.Nd2!? exd3 6.Bxd3) 5.dxe4 Nxe4 6.Nf3 Bc5 7.Qe2 Nf5 8.Nc3 Qe7 9.Be3!} Nf6 5. d3 Bb4 6. Bd2 {After 6.dxe4 Nxe4 7.Qd4 Qe7 Black has a comfortable game: 8.Be2 0-0 9.Bd2 Nxd2 10.Qxd2 c6! (10...Bg4 has also been played) 11.Nf3 (11.dxc6?! Rd8 12.Qc1 Nxc6; 11.0-0-0 cxd5 12.Bf3 Be6 and ...Nc6) 11...cxd5 12.0-0 Nc6 (Bardeleben-Blackburne, London 1895)} e3 {(!?) "Entirely in Morphy's style! We have here a splendid example of a POSITIONAL sacrifice." (Euwe) Later they began making this move automatically, occasionally also trying 6...exd3 7.Bxd3 0-0. But in the game Spassky-Bronstein (Moscow 1971) Black actually preferred 6....0-0 and after 7.Nxe4 Re8 8.Bxb4 Nxe4 9.dxe4 Rxe4+ 10.Be2 Rxb4 (a variation by Falkbeer!) 11.Nf3 Rxf4 12.Qd2 Qd6 13.0-0-0 Nd7 14.Nd4 a6 15.g3 Rf6 16.Rhe1 Ne5 17.Bh5 Bd7 18.Qe2 Re8 he gained a draw. Apparently, after 6...e3, without going into details, Spassky was intending somewhere to improve on Schulten's play...} 7. Bxe3 O-O 8. Bd2 {Black's lead in development and a much safer king make up for the material disadvantage. No better is 8.Be2 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Nxd5 10.Bd2 Qf6!, or 8.Ne2 Re8 9.Bd2 Bxc3 10.Bxc3 Nxd5 (Schulten-Kolisch, Paris 1860)} Bxc3 {Eliminating the knight, which in some cases could have covered the e-file. Ex: 8...Nxd5 9.Nxd5 Re8+ 10.Ne3 (10.Be2!?) 10...Rxde3+ 11.Kf2, or 8...Re8+ 9.Be2 (inferior is 9.Nce2?! Bc5, when 10.c4? Ng4 11.Nh3 Qh4+ 12.g2 Nxh2! is not possible, while after 10.Nf3 Qxd5 Black is OK) 9...Bg4 10.Ne4! with advantage for White.} 9. bxc3 Re8+ {Later there occurred 9...Nxd5 10.Qf3 (10.Nf3 Qf6!) 10...re8+ 11.Ne2 Nc6 with double-edges play, although more active is 10.c4! Re8+ 11.Be2 Ne3 (11...Nf6 12.Nf3 Qe7 13.Ne5 Nc6 14.Bc3! Estrin) 12.Bxe3 Rxe3 12.Kf2! Re8 (incorrect is 13...Qd4? 14.Nf3 Qxf4 15.Qc1 Petroff-Schumoff, St Petersburg 1862) 14.Nf3, and Black still has to find real compensation for the pawn (for example, 14...Bg4 15.Qd2 Bxf3 16.Bxf3 Qd4+ 17.Kg3! etc.)} 10. Be2 Bg4 {Since Morphy won this game quickly, one does not feel inclined to critisize this move. Especially since after 10...Nxd5 11.c4!, as followed from my notes on the previous move, it is not obvious that Black can equalise.} 11. c4 {Greedy and materialistic. According to Neishtadt, this was the decisive mistake, though Kasparov disagrees. Neishtadt writes, "White could have escaped from the pin, firstly, by 11.h3 Bxe2 12.Nxe2 Qe7 (12...Nxd5 13.0-0) 13.Kf2 (Kasparov: "In my opinion, 13.c4?! c6 14.dxc6 Nxc6 Kf2 Qc5+ 16.Kg3 Re6 17.Kh2  Rae8 18.Ng3 is more promising") 13...Nxd5 14.Re1 Ne3 15.Qc1. Secondly, there was also the more useful move 11.Kf2, after which it is not easy for Black to demonstrate that his initiative is worth the sacrficided pawn". According to Estrin, however, after 11.h3 stronger is 11...Qxd5! 12.Kf2 (12.hxg4? Qxg2) 12...Bx2 13.Nxe2 Qc5+! "with the initiative for Black" (although the position after 14.Kg3 is by no means clear), whereas perhaps 11.Kf2 is indeed useful: 11.Bxe2 12.Nxe2 Qxd5 13. Rf1 (13.re1 Nc6 14.Kg1 Qc5+! 15.d4 Qd5=) 13...Nc6 (13...Qc5+ 14.Kg3 Qh5 15.Nd4; 13...Ng4+!?) 14.Kg1 Qc5+ 15.Kh1 Ng4 16.Nd4 with a slight advantage.} c6 {(!)} 12. dxc6 {(??) This REALLY is the decisive mistake, a move of roughly a third category player. Absolutely essential was 12.h3 Bxe2 13.Nxe2 cxd5 14.cxd5 Qxd5 15.0-0 with an extra pawn, for which Black has some compensation, but not more. Now, however, Black has an ENORMOUS lead in development and initiative along with an irresistible attack.} Nxc6 {With the threat of ...Nd4} 13. Kf1 {White would no longer have saved the game by 13.h3 Bxe2 14.Nxe2 Nd4, or 13.Bc3 Nd4 14.Bxd4 Qxd4 15.Nf3 Bxf3 16.gxf3 Nh5, or 13.Kf2 Qb6+ (but not 13...Rxe2+? 14.Nxe2 Nd4 15.Re1) 14.Kg3 Rxe2 15.Nxe2 Nd4.} Rxe2 {(!) disaster strikes on e2!} 14. Nxe2 Nd4 15. Qb1 Bxe2+ 16. Kf2 {16.Kg1 Nxc2 and 16.Ke1 Qe7 are equally hopeless} Ng4+ 17. Kg1 {If 17.Ke1 (17.Kg3 Nf5+ and ...Qh4#), then17...Qh4+ 18.g3 Qe7 or 18...Re8!} Nf3+ {(!) Morphy forces mate in seven moves} 18. gxf3 Qd4+ 19. Kg2 Qf2+ 20. Kh3 Qxf3+ 21. Kh4 {Here Black announced mate in three: 21...Ne3 22.Rg1 Nf5+ 23.Kg5 Qh5#. White resigns. 0-1}
