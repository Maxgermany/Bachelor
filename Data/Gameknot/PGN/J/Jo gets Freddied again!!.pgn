1. c4 {Hi everyone!  Yet another round against Freddy and yet another date with Old Matey.  How did this happen, well, to summarise, I start of with c4 which is the English Opening which controls the squares b5 and d5 and also allows for Nc3 without blocking in the c pawn.  Freddy then surprises me with b5 - a gambit.  I decide to accept the gambit, well you never know, if I can hang on to the gambit material and he doesn't get any play for it then despite the near 500 rating difference I may be able to get an endgame victory.  But there is the saying "Many a slip twixt cup and lip" and boy doese'nt it happen here!  Freddy mixes things up in the database and I end up developing Fou Lenoir on the wrong square, d2 instead of b2.  This made one heck of a difference as I was unable to control the c column and so had to concede that to Freddy.  Freddy then won back the pawn and weakened my kingside pawn structure.  If only I could swap off the heavies.  Freddy only had pawns on the kingside and I had a remote passer - with opposite bishops that would most probably have meant two words ........ draw game ........ but the heavies stayed on.  Ironically the most active piece was, wait for it ............GLENDA!!  Unfortunately she strayed from Henry's side to try to aid promotion of my remote a pawn - unfortunately allowing for a decisive and fatal invasion of the Wicked Witch of the West and that is when Henry met an ignominious end.  Anyhow, on with the game.} b5 2. cxb5 Nf6 3. Nc3 {3. Nc3 - after the b pawn is gambited there are two normal developing knight moves on both sides, one to c3 and the other f6.} Bb7 4. d4 a6 5. e3 axb5 6. Nxb5 {6. Nxb5 - seems to consolidate white's pawn advantage, doubleton removed and I have an outside passed a pawn.} e6 7. Nf3 Be7 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O {9.0-0 - so far so natural.  Normal routine development on both sides and I think I have equality here.   However, it is 2 moves down the line that it starts to go mouldy on me.} Na6 10. a3 Qb8 11. Bd2 {11. Bd2?! - would b3 have been a better try here?} Ng4 12. h3 Nf6 13. Nc3 {13. Nc3? - on second thoughts I wonder if it was this move which was the lemon.  Would Rc1 have been a better plan here?  At least I would have bagged the c column first.} c5 14. dxc5 Nxc5 15. b4 Nce4 16. Bd3 Rc8 17. Nxe4 {17. Nxe4 - I would have loved to have backed up the knight with Rc1 but the a pawn would have been left hanging and the b pawn would have been left weak.} Nxe4 18. a4 {18. a4 - this pawn move releases the rook from the defense of the a5 pawn, now it is defended by ........ guess who ........ well, who else ......... Glenda!  Always, on that back rank, defending pawns.  Right now she would just lurve to be on g7 but she would need to be teleported there!} Nxd2 19. Qxd2 Bxf3 20. gxf3 Bxb4 21. Qd1 Bc3 22. Rb1 {22. Rb1 - after a plethora of exchanges Freddy has regained his pawn and busted up my kingside pawn structure.  I try to defend my valuable a4 passer by attacking the witch and then placing Fou Leblanc onto b5 next move.} Qa7 23. Bb5 d5 24. Qd3 {24. Qd3 - Glenda moves but I think that over the next 4 moves I had the opportunity to put a rook on c1 to neutralise the power of Freddy's rook on the c column.  I could have then moved Henry to h2 and then used my other rook to try and help Glenda attack the enemy king.  But silly me did not do this and I paid the price.  Do you the jury agree?} Qe7 25. f4 Qf6 26. Qe2 h6 27. Qg4 g6 28. h4 {28. h4? - a well intentioned move, this move is intended to try and open the g column and then place a rook on the g file and then Glenda and the rook neatly line up on the enemy king.  But there is the little matter of the Wicked Witch of the West.} h5 29. Qg5 {29. Qg5 - offering a queen trade but Freddy's next move puts the blockers on that.  The h4 pawn will fall.  In hindsight it would have been better to have let it go - at least I would have avoided getting Freddied later on.} Bb2 30. Kg2 Qg7 31. Rbd1 Rc2 {31. ........ Rc2 - invasion!} 32. Qe7 Rac8 33. Qb7 {33. Qb7 - this loses spectacularly - the plan was to try and shepherd that remote passer to a8 to become Glenda 2, but now comes my doom!} Qf6 34. Rfh1 {34. Rh1 - defending the loose h pawn but allowing something worse.  Here come some creeping moves on the light squares by the Wicked Witch.} Qf5 {34. ....... Qf5 - here she comes!} 35. Kf1 Qg4 {35. .......... Qg4 - here she comes!  Notice the rook on d1 is en prise.} 36. Re1 Qf3 {36. ......... Qf3 - here she is!  Oooh, nasty, nasty, now the rook on h1 is en prise.  I move the rook to h2 thinking I have covered everything, but, here comes a stunning Master Pseudo-Sacrifice.......} 37. Rh2 Rxf2+ {37. .......... Rxf2 !!!  Here Freddy announced mate in 11 beginning with:- 38. Rxf2 Qh1  39. Ke2 Rc2  40. Kd1 Rc1  41. Ke2 Qxe1  42. Kf3 Qd1  43. Re2 Qf1  44. Rf2 Qh3  45. Ke2 Qg4  46. Rf3 Qg2  47. Rf2 Rc2  48. Kd1 Qxf2 49. Qc8  Rxc8 50. Be2 Qg1  51. Bf1 Qxf1  52. Kd2 Bc1#.  Like a good little girl I start to play out the moves.  Freddy sets them up as conditionals.  I play out the moves because I will have a hands on tuition on how to conduct a king hunt to the death.  I am very inexperienced at this sort of thing.  I have mounted a few successful mating attacks on lower rated players but with Freddy announcing #11 this all seems so crude and amateurish compared to this awesome thing that Freddy is about to show me.  I suppose the first step to being able to mount a successful mating attack is to be on the receiving end of one!} 38. Rxf2 Qh1+ 39. Ke2 Rc2+ 40. Kd1 Rc1+ 41. Kd2 {41. Kd2 - now here is a fingerslip - I should have played Ke2 but, this turns out to be a happy fingerslip because although I still cop Old Matey I choose the quickest and least painful route.  For, after the game, I was able to access my personal db, call up this game and analyse what would have happened had I continue to play along with Freddy.  The answer - I would have lost all, yes all of my pieces bar Henry.  The bishop checkmate at the end would have been very pretty but I would have hated to give up all my pieces first, so at least I was spared that.} Qxe1+ {41. ......... Qxe1  - #3} 42. Kd3 Rc3+ {42. ........ Rc3  - #2} 43. Kd4 Qxe3# {43. ......... Qxe3#.  An ignominious and undignified end for me pore Ole 'Enry.  But I will be back Freddy, never fear!  Joanne}
