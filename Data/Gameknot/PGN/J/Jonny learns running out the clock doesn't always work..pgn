1. e4 {Let this serve as a warning to those who would quit on games early in, to save their ratings. It doesn't always work. Jonny let's the clock run out after move 4, after suffering a slight setback. The game is rated.} e6 2. d4 {Central pawns. This is how you do it.} Nc6 3. Nf3 {I guard the pawn.} Nxd4 {He attacks anyway.} 4. Nxd4 {He dies, and lets the clock run out, probably hoping the game would not wind up rated, but it is, and he's lost a game official and on the record due more to cowardice than ineptitude. Take that, Jonny97!}
