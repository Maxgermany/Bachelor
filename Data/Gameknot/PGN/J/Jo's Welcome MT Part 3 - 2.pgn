[Opening "Scandinavian defence (B01)"]

1. e4 {Return match against blitzkov. Unfortunately for me, it wasn't a fine demostration form my side. } d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {I am deflectinf from "My" Scandinavian with this move. } 3. d4 {Best response by white by test. } e6 {Trying to develop through the Icelandic gambit.} 4. dxe6 Bxe6 {Two pieces out for a central pawn... hardly a bargain, but let's see. } 5. Nf3 Nbd7 {This was made to leave the "c" pawn free to advance. } 6. Bd3 c5 7. c3 {I considered that in order to take some advantage of my superior developement it was a nice idea to... spend a pawn's move in order to "squeeze" white's position a little. } c4 8. Bc2 {It would be difficult for white to create a battery of Q and B against h7. Now I considered b5, in order to further block white's pieces developement, but then white would have had some countergame with a4. Better to concentrate in keeping ahead in developement. } Bd6 {I don't want the white's dsb to set on f4. } 9. O-O Qc7 {My battery is armed. It's not a very whorty one, but with the bishop and the kinght, conditions for attack are given. } 10. Re1 {Now white is threatening d5, because the bishop is pinned. Time to castle... on what side, dear reader? } O-O {This was the wrong one. I feared a counter attack by white with b3, opening the queenside, thus moving the game on the side of the castled king. But I shouldn't. You'll see why.} 11. Nbd2 h6 {The normal attack was Ng4, hitting h2... but after h3, it goes nowhere. Instead, if I would have castled queenside, after h3 I can confidently play the sac h5!, and if hxN, hxg would have recovered the piece and played a risky but strong attack. Now, I realize that the only way to disrupt white's fortress is to throw in some pawns... uncovering my king. But no way: I cannot play without looking for an attack. And this move covers g5, which is good anyway. } 12. Ne4 {Obvious, since white has to untangle his pieces. I don't want my dsb to be exchanged, so...} Nxe4 13. Bxe4 {...but remember: avoid to exchange piece when you have superior developement, or you'll easily lose it. This way, white owns a very nice diagonal, and supports the lethal d5. I had to act quickly, or the game will return to be even. So I dared, pretty irresponsibly...} f5 {If d5, fxB, dxB, exNf3, exNd7, Bxh2+, and black has a winning attack. But I overlooked the simple 14. Bxb2!, QxB, RxBe6 (who has became undefended when the f pawn was moved!). Instead, the more normal and calm Nf6 leads to 14. d5, Bd7. White has blocked his good white diagonal, and he has to retire or exchange his lsb. It was not a bad result for me. So I played with enthusiasm more than calculation, and this is a very common mistake at chess. } 14. Bc2 {White chooses to retire. Probably he is happy having my own f pawn blocking my lsb's action. And, of course, I have to take care of my lsb, but this is not a problem: } Bd5 {Now it's me who is mastering the good white diagonal. I threat inmediately BxN, and then Bxh2+. Not a big deal, but still something white has to care for.  } 15. h3 {Ha ha, this was the very elegant way white defended: just moving the attacked pawn. Very, very smart. I can lose the bishop's pair, give my check and... nothing. I have to be tricky. } g5 {I choosed the wrong way, but as I said: all my game was based on a quick attack, so I went for it. My own pieces, although well placed, are impotent without a pawn's break. And I have to count on a tempo loss to place the rook behind it, as it should... and, finally, for beginners: this move opens the way for the white Queen to h5. And the white knight can go to e5, because if I exchange it, I cannot retake the white pawn in e5 because I have to spend a tempo defending the bishop.} 16. Ne5 {I suspect that white realized all that, too :-D} Rf6 {Trying to surprise my opponent, depriving him of a place in g6, and defending h6 after the queens goes to h5. } 17. f4 {White uses his advantage and returns me with the same coin. Now I'm not sure it is convenient for me to open the files, since my rook cannot move to the right place (g7) and I cannot exchange. I realized by now how different would have been my position having castled queenside - true is that probably white's moves would have been others. } Bf7 {It's useless to try to keep the advantage of a bishop's pair. At least, I can have white exchanging the strong knight....} 18. Nxf7 {Which he did, of course, since it didn't avoid him to have a strong column all wide open, and, of course, Qh5. } Rxf7 {Here, it is very depressing to try to decide if it is better to take with the rook or the king. It's just choosing the best way to lose. } 19. fxg5 {I don't know what is more sadistic on white's part: to delay the deadly Qh5, or just wait to see me trembling. :-D} Bg3 {I thought that I had to make some room for my pieces. The check was futile, and Bf4 couldn't avoid g6 or gxh. } 20. Re6 {Even more sadistic :-D Beginners, learn how to attack... in a sadistic way. I hoped for Re3?, f4, but of course such things happen only in dreams. } Nf8 {Ah ha! My knight can move, and he does a wonderful job defending, even if never for an attack. } 21. Rxh6 {I feared g6, NxR, gxR+, Kxg7, Qh5, a sure mate net, with those nasty bishop aiming to my kingside. But my problems are still to come, of course. } Re8 {So I sat the only threat I could, just for bringing my rook into the game to help, trying to exchange as much as possible. } 22. Bd2 {Of course not Qh5, Re1#. Now, the tricks are over, sadly.   } Re6 {The only way I saw to avoid the worst. } 23. Qh5 {Finally. I know I can't survive this. } Rxh6 {Limiting white's firepower, but hopelessly. } 24. gxh6 Bf4 {The bishop is no longer useful on g3, so better to exchange it. I know that the f pawn is a goner, but I couldn't allow the white's lsb to look undisturbed to h7. } 25. Bxf4 Qxf4 {I even have a shadow of a check in e3! Oh! :-). To be truthful, I was looking for Rh7, and after the exchanges take the h6 pawn. But this leaves me against two joined pawns for an endgame, so even if I survive the storm, I'm doomed. } 26. Rf1 Qe3+ 27. Kh1 Rh7 {What else? :-(} 28. Qxf5 {Better than Bxf5. And now, everything could hold but for a "residual advantage", as you'll see. My Nf8 is threatened, so I can't take Rxh6. The knight cannot move or Qxh7. So...} Qxh6 {Is was a mistake, but it was hard to see compensation in Qe7. It was in the fact that white has, as a minimum Qd5+, and if black covers the check with the rook, to avoid a subsequent BxRh7+, now, in h6, the queen doesn't help to the defence of f7, as it does in e7. so QxR becomes possible for white. So this was a mistake. } 29. Qxf8+ {White found the right way to had the most of the situation. In any case, BxR will win the piece and the game. } Qxf8 30. Rxf8+ {The "residual tactic" is now that the king is forced to let undefended his rook. } Kxf8 31. Bxh7 {So no point in going on. I have no chance even to be stalled against a strong player like blitzkov. Thank you for the lesson!}
