1. Nf3 {An opening I never faced. } d5 2. c4 d4 3. g3 f6 4. Bg2 e5 5. d3 {Ok, a dangerous closed pawn chain. My bsb will be suffering, so it seems a good idea to exchange it soon. } Bb4+ 6. Bd2 a5 7. O-O Ra7 {An "offline" move, designed to protect the b2 pawn, freeing my wsb, and prepare a future attack on the queenside. } 8. Bxb4 axb4 9. Nbd2 Bd7 10. Re1 Ne7 11. e3 dxe3 12. Rxe3 Na6 {This knight is aiming to c4. I won't block this square with my pawn. } 13. d4 exd4 14. Nxd4 Nc5 {I simply didn't see the white's move, here...} 15. Qh5+ g6 16. Qxc5 {And end of the game. Or not? I could recover the piece, if he lets me. } b6 17. Qxb4 {Why not Qd5? This way he returns me the piece.} c5 18. Qc3 cxd4 19. Qxd4 Kf7 {But I am 2 pawns under. } 20. c5 bxc5 21. Qxc5 Ra5 {Again, I didn't see the white move. Bad game for me. } 22. Rxe7+ Qxe7 23. Qxa5 Rb8 24. b3 Rb5 25. Qa7 Re5 26. Nc4 Re2 27. Rd1 Bg4 28. Qxe7+ Kxe7 {}
