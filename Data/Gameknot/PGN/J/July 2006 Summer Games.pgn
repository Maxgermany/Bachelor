1. d4 {Damn..prefer to see e4 so I can play my favourite..French defence. } Nf6 {My standard reply to d4} 2. Nc3 e6 3. a3 d5 4. Bg5 {I cant have this Knight pinned too long so..} Be7 {Interpose Bish to free Knight} 5. Qd3 h6 {not comfortable with that threatening bishop there...chase it away } 6. Bf4 c5 {time to challenge for centre} 7. Qb5+ {But havent I just lost my pawn on c5 now?} Qd7 8. Qd3 {BUT HE DIDNT SEE IT} c4 9. Qg3 {hmmmm..very threatening ! Knight on B8 and pawn on G7 attacked } Nh5 {so counter-attack is order of the day....} 10. Qg4 Nxf4 {and I get out of trouble for the time being with the exchange} 11. Qxf4 Bf6 {my pieces are woefully underdeveloped so time to get them moving now..} 12. h4 {where is he going with that??} Nc6 {continuing development} 13. e3 {worried I might move knight to B4 then C2 , so this stops me} a6 {similairly stopping his Knight} 14. e4 O-O {I am very restricted al round here..havent made the best job of my opening development. Bishop on C8 has no move...not very good from me so far..} 15. Rh3 b5 {Gives the Bish a move...for what its worth !} 16. Rg3 {Immediate threat is Qxh6 , pawn on G7 pinned so cant re-capture..I should have seen this coming before now} Bxd4 {Stupidly ignoring the previous threat..or have I got a cunning plan?} 17. Qxh6 g6 {Big pices now lined up attacking my King..OH NO !!} 18. h5 {And now the infantry join in...} Bg7 {Have to at least chase away the enemy Queen} 19. Qg5 Qd8 {Still chasing her..happy to take the exchange here.} 20. Qg4 {But he doesnt want it..who can blame him. Its causing me trouble !} d4 {Not going to sit around and wait for him to mate me..so on the counter -attack we go...} 21. Nce2 Ne5 {Determined to keep niggling away at that Queen too} 22. Qh3 {At least its on the sidelines now and not so active..} d3 {sprint for the line.....} 23. Rd1 {But that will stop him...(he thinks!)} dxc2 {I cant take that pawn...it was pinned against my Queen..am I mad?} 24. Rxd8 {yes..there it goes..oh no !} Rxd8 {queen for rook down now..but look where I have got my pawn...} 25. f3 {An escape square for King..as R-d1 was mate} Rd1+ 26. Kf2 {hee hee..talk about cramped positions...lets see if I can take advantage} Nd3+ {Check and covering the square for queening too} 27. Ke3 Bh6+ 28. f4 {only real option for him..K-D4 gives me chance to win queen with a discovered check} Bxf4+ 29. Kf3 {Hopes he would go for the echanges there..I want to remove that knight now} Rxf1+ {but if I attack his King instead...} 30. Kg4 e5+ {I can win back my queen with this pretty skewer...} 31. Kh4 g5+ {no rush to take it just yet though} 32. Rxg5+ Bxg5+ {gettin greedy and having Rook for Bish too..} 33. Kxg5 Bxh3 {Got it...} 34.

Ke7 Ra7+ {which wont take long with the advantage I have now..Well I dont often sacrifice a Queen , but this one was fun !}
