[Opening "Norwegian defence (B06)"]

1. e4 g6 {This is the so-called Modern Defense, where black allows white to dominate the centre in the beginning. It is an opening that requires extensive positional skills from the black player, and which I would not recommend to beginners} 2. d4 c6 {2....c6 is solid, but d6 and Bg7 are more common variants, which would make the defense to closely resemble the Pirc (Jugoslav) opening} 3. Nf3 Bg7 4. Nc3 d5 5. e5 {White's 5. e5 is not the best move, but it is typical of Stalhandske's attack style. One of it's aims here is to make a clamp on black's development (especially the fianchettoed bishop)} Bg4 {Black's immediate reply with 5.....f6 would have been much stronger, I think, than Bg4} 6. h3 Bxf3 {Obviously, the bishop cannot retreat to h5, and any other position would have been passive and loss of tempo. In fact, elimination of white's strong knight at f3 is a good idea and perhaps worth the N/B exchange} 7. Qxf3 e6 { } 8. Be3 {8. Be3 is a solid but dull move. White could (should?) have initiated the K-side attack here by 8. h4 } Ne7 {Black makes himself ready for castling (though he never will!), whereby white finally wakes up......} 9. h4 {...and starts the K-side attack} Nf5 {9.....Nf5 is not bad. It threatens both the bishop at e3 and the attacking pawn at h4. However, I think it underestimates the strength of white's attack, which would have been effectively halted by 9...h5! } 10. g4 {White continues the attack and "sacrifices" the bishop at e3} Nxe3 {10....Nxe3 is an excellent move! Nxh4 would have been countered by Qg3. I think black has managed to pretty much equalise the position here} 11. fxe3 { } c5 {11.....c5 is not bad and presumably meant to open up the lines against white's king as soon as he has castled long. However, I think this would have been the last opportunity to play f6 to "clear up" the K side} 12. O-O-O {White castles long (h5 was another option, but comes later)} a6 {a6 is an excellent move, preventing attacks via b5 and at the same time preparing for a Q-side pawn storm against white's king.} 13. Kb1 {13. Kb1, the "second move" of the long castling. I don't recall why white was so cautious here; 13. h5 would have been quite possible!} Nc6 14. h5 {Well, finally the K-side attack sets in - it is not too late because black has neglected his K-side (for example by not playing f6)} cxd4 15. exd4 {Black completes his plan of "opening the lines" on the Q side} Qb6 {15......Qb6 is a logical consequence of black's attack plan. However, it is premature and underestimates white's K-side attack. It brings away the black queen, who would have been important in the defense. This is the move that loses the game for black (with a little exaggeration).} 16. h6 {16. h6 does not look very strong, but it initiates a sequence of events that lead to black's defeat} Bf8 {16. Bf8 is obvious} 17. Qf6 {17. Qf6 is the key move that starts black's demise. Perhaps as a teaching lesson, it is important to note here that Qf6 brings the black Q into attacking position with a move that at the same time forces white to lose a tempo, because black's move ALSO threatens the black rook. There is, therefore, for example no time to bring the black Q in for rescue!} Rg8 18. Nxd5 {18. Nxd5 is the second key move of this attack. Either black's Q needs to move now or then exd5} exd5 {Black choses 18....exd5, which is the "obvious choice".  However, the perhaps less intuitive 18...Qd8 or even Qa5 also seem possible. But the game is over for all practical purposes.} 19. e6 {Now, the avenue is straight ahead. 19. e6 is the third key move of the original plan } Qc7 {The black Q comes to rescue, but is she too late?} 20. Bg2 {somewhat embarrassingly, the bishop at f1 prevents it all for white....the two rooks MUST connect, otherwise black may be back in full force} Rd8 21. Rde1 fxe6 22. Qxe6+ Ne7 23. Qxg8 Kd7 24. Qxh7 Qg3 {24.....Qg3 does not achieve anything in a game that is already lost} 25. Qf7 {Altogether, I think black played very well. In particular, he managed the beginning and early middle game excellently. However, there was a refrain from playing f6 that could (would?) have helped. Then, there was a clear underestimation of white's K-side attack. "One look away" (moving the Q to the Q side) was enough to trigger the avalanche that followed. }
