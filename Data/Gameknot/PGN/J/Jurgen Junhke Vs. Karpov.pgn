[Opening "Ruy Lopez (C77), Morphy defence"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 {Ruy Lopez} a6 {Pretty standard.} 4. Ba4 {Retreat variation.} Nf6 {Morphy defense.} 5. d4 {5.d4!? This is some variation of the centre attack. I've never seen it ever being played. I think the idea is if 5. ... exd4 6. e5. This line shouldn't be too effective against Karpov.} exd4 6. O-O Be7 {This transposes into the centre attack. Black develops the dark squared bishop while breaking the pin on his king.} 7. e5 {Attacks the knight and gains space.} Ne4 {Nice position for the knight. Since the E file is closed, the square isn't so bad.} 8. Nxd4 {Regains the lost pawn.} O-O {Black finally safeguards his king.} 9. Nf5 {Future threats on g7 and provoking d6 or g6.} d5 {Attacks the knight.} 10. Bxc6 {Shatters blacks pawn structure.} bxc6 11. Nxe7+ Qxe7 12. Re1 {Black doesn't want to play Qxe5 because that just drops a knight after f3.} Re8 {This move is silent but deadly. It contains a little trap.} 13. f3 {It's understandable that you want to chase the knight away and open the file up.} Nd6 {The knight is immune because if 14. exd6 qxe1+ 15. Qxe1 Rxe1+ 16. Kf2 Rxc1. Up a rook and in a winning position.} 14. b3 Nf5 {Black has more active pieces. White is still cramped and struggling to develop.} 15. Ba3 {Attacks the queen. This move isn't too effective as the e7 wasn't the best place for the queen. Better was probably Bb2. Nd2 is playable.} Qg5 16. Bb2 {16. Bb2? A waste of time. He seems to know of blacks attack. Better here was Qd2 trying to exchange queens.} Nh4 {Threatening mate.} 17. Qd2 {Offering the exchange of queens and protecting g2.} f6 18. Qf2 Bh3 {Attacks g2 a third time. Will whtie be able to withstand blacks attack?} 19. g4 {Completely understandable. Now one attacker is gone.} fxe5 {Now black is a pawn up in a winning position.} 20. Nd2 {Although white develops his knight this completely loses. Better was Nc3 or Qg3 or Qe3.} Qxd2 {Karpov finishes Junhke with a tactical shot. If 21. Qxd2, Black will win the queen baack with Nxf3 and then Nxd2. If white tries Nxh4 then Qg2# If any other move he's down a knight and a pawn and will have to survive an attack. Junhke was only an amateur at the time.}
