1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 {2. .......... Nf6 - the more modern way of meeting the Scandinavian Defense or Centre Counter opening, characterised by 1.e4 d5. 2. exd5.} 3. d4 Nxd5 {3. ............ Nxd5 - black regains his pawn after the standard d4 response to 2........ Nf6.} 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bf5 {5. ......... Bf5 - white builds up a centre with c4 and d4 and develops a knight to c3.  The king knight is driven back to f6 and now black develops his bishop to f5 which is a strong deployment for this piece.} 6. Nf3 h6 7. h3 e6 8. Be2 c6 9. O-O Nbd7 10. Bf4 {10. Bf4 - over the last few moves we continue to develop our pieces.} Be7 11. Qd2 g5 12. Bh2 a6 13. Qd1 b5 14. cxb5 axb5 {14. ........... axb5 - this move leaves me with an IQP - fortunately this does not cost me the game!} 15. Ne5 Qb6 16. a3 Rd8 17. Bf3 Nd5 18. Nxd5 exd5 19. Rc1 Nxe5 20. Bxe5 {20. Bxe5 - I was unable to keep my knight on e5 and a lot of wood has been cleared from the board over the last few moves.} f6 21. Bh2 O-O {21. .......... 0-0  - after driving my bishop back to a2 black finally castles.} 22. Re1 Rf7 23. Bh5 Rg7 24. Bg4 Be4 25. Be2 c5 26. dxc5 Bxc5 {26. ......... Bxc5 - my opponent helps me get rid of my d pawn isolani but gets a passer in return.} 27. Rf1 Rgd7 28. Qb3 b4 29. axb4 Qxb4 30. Qxb4 Bxb4 {30. ........ Bxb4 - the queens are now exchanged.  Black's position is preferable because he has superior mobility.  Both of us have passed isolanis but black's is more advanced.  But, incredibly, later on, that vulnerable looking b pawn will spell checkmate for the black king later on, albeit in another form!!} 31. Rfd1 d4 32. Bd3 f5 33. Bxe4 fxe4 {33. ..... fxe4 - one pair of bishops are now swapped off.  The black pawns are connected so my king must start to centralise himself which he does with 34. Kf1.} 34. Kf1 e3 35. fxe3 dxe3 36. Rxd7 Rxd7 {36. ........... Rxd7 - but black exchanges one pair of pawns - his e pawn is passed but is an isolani and I must fix that pawn on a dark square so it is vulnerable to king and bishop attack later on.  This plan succeeds.} 37. Rc2 Kf7 38. Rc7 Rxc7 39. Bxc7 {39. Bxc7 - now the rooks have been swapped off.  Black continues to centralise his king.} Ke6 40. Bb6 Bd2 41. Ke2 Bc1 42. b4 {42. b4 - the e pawn is doubly attacked and once defended.  The black king cannot protect it in time.  My b pawn advances out of range of the black lsb and towards b8.} Ba3 43. b5 Bd6 44. Bxe3 {44. Bxe3 - the bishop is finally able to gobble up that passer.  I now have a one pawn advantage but can I convert it.  If I do then, although this is an unrated game, this will be my biggest triumph on gameknot.  Just look at those ratings!!} Bb8 45. Kd3 Kd5 46. Bd4 h5 47. g4 hxg4 48. hxg4 {48. hxg4 - the h pawns disappear from the board.} Ke6 49. Be3 Kf6 50. b6 {50. b6 - that pawn edges ever closer to b8.} Kg6 51. Kc4 Kf6 52. Kd5 Bg3 53. Kc6 {53. Kc6 - the black king is cut off from the b pawn.  I can draw this game with one fell stroke by taking on g5 with the dsb, but I scent victory!!!} Be5 54. b7 Bb8 55. Kd7 {55. Kd7 - cuts off the black king still further and prepares to shepherd the b pawn to the b8 square.  The black dsb must be driven away from b8!} Ke5 56. Bxg5 {56. Bxg5 - now black cannot win.} Ke4 57. Kc8 Be5 58. Bd8 {58. Bd8!! - the killer.  That bishop cannot be prevented from going to c7.  The bishop will either be driven off the h2 - b8 diagonal or exchanged.  Although black plays Kf4 with a view to taking the white g pawn, I will be left with sufficient material - a WQ to force checkmate.  I do play Bc7 on the next move and black waves the white flag giving me my first victory on gameknot over 1750  oppo.  Ten years ago I did beat an 1800s  player OTB but this has only ever happened to me once, so yes, this is a triumph in more ways than one because my opponent was a joint winner along with Pukism in the GK38 tournament.  Zamzaweck beat me 2-0 and this was during my Big Slump!  I just hope there will be more triumphs like this to come.} Kf4 59. Bc7 {}
