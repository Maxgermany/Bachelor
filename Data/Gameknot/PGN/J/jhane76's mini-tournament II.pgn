1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {Here we go again. I do know other openings. Honestly.} h6 4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d4 exd4 6. Qxd4 c5 7. Qd1 Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. Bf4 Nc6 10. Bb5 Be7 {All fairly routine. I think I have slightly better development at this stage, but its arguable.} 11. Bxc6+ bxc6 12. Qd3 {Prep for castling.} O-O 13. g4 Bg6 14. Nh2 Re8 15. f3 Bf8 {Don't really get the point of that move.} 16. O-O-O d5 17. Qe3 {Or that one.} d4 18. Qf2 Qb6 {Fortunate he can't take the knight this time.} 19. Na4 Qb5 20. b3 Rad8 21. Bd2 c4 22. Nb2 {And this is where it all starts to go horribly wrong.} c3 {Having fallen for it once, you'd think I'd be more alert. You'd be wrong.} 23. Bxc3 dxc3 24. Na4 Ba3+ 25. Kb1 {Forced move since the only alternative sacrifices the knight and forces exactly the same.} Rdb8 26. Nxc3 Qe5 {Can't move the knight as it exposes the mate in one.} 27. Qe3 a5 {I think this was a wasted move. I would have played K-d5 increasing the pressure on the c3 knight. If pxK QxQ, if RxK pxR. Either way white is further disadvantaged.} 28. Rd3 {Just in case the queen is forced out by K-d5.} a4 29. Qd4 {Trying to exchange to relieve some of the pressure.} Qa5 30. Rhd1 axb3 31. cxb3 Bb4 32. Rd1d2 {Can't rem why I thought that was a good idea. It must have seemed like it at the time.} c5 33. Qc4 Rec8 34. Rc2 Ne8 35. Nd5 {I was aiming for the King/Rook fork, but if that doesn't work I'm quite happy to have the bishop off.} Ba3 36. Ne7+ {A potential mistake my opponent doesn't capitalise on. } Kf8 {Thats a forced move.} 37. Nxc8 Rxc8 {Thats not. Q-e1 there would have put me in all sorts of trouble. R-d1 is useless. R-c1 isn't much better.} 38. Rd1 {Stopping the Q-e1.} Nc7 39. Qa4 {Still willing to exchange and double pawns to remove threats.} Qxa4 40. bxa4 Ne6 41. Nf1 Ra8 42. Rc4 Nd4 43. Rd3 f6 {I can only assume he saw the def component of the white move and not the offensive component.} 44. Rxa3 Ne6 45. Nd2 Rd8 46. Kc2 Nd4+ 47. Kc3 Ne2+ 48. Kc2 Nd4+ 49. Kc1 {I did assume here he was trying for perpetual.} Ne2+ 50. Kd1 Nf4 51. Kc2 Nxh3 52. Rxc5 Nf4 53. Rac3 Ne6 54. Rc5c8 Nd4+ 55. Kb2 Re8 56. Rxe8+ Bxe8 {Definately happy to exchange now ;-)} 57. a5 {On reflection I could have left that there to tempt his bishop in then responding with R-c4.} Ne2 58. Rc8 Ke7 59. a6 Bd7 60. Rc4 Bb5 61. Rc7+ Kd6 62. Ra7 Nd4 63. Ra8 Bc6 64. Rg8 Ne6 65. a7 Nc7 66. Rxg7 Nb5 67. Rg6 Nxa7 68. Rxf6+ Kc7 69. Rxh6 Nb5 70. Rxc6+ {That eliminates the last prospects of me losing. I figured I had enough of an advantage to force the win so saccing the rook was an extravagance I could afford.} Kxc6 71. f4 Nd6 72. Kc3 Kc5 73. a4 Kb6 {That allows the fork and effectively seals it, since his king can't be in two places at once.} 74. Nc4+ Kc6 75. Nxd6 Kxd6 76. Kc4 Ke6 77. a5 Kd6 78. Kb5 {}
