1. d4 {Wriggle and Squirm  Close fought battle that I eventually managed to squeak home in.} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {I still hate queens pawn openings. I have no idea what I'm doing.} 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e4 e6 5. Bxc4 Bb4 6. Nge2 Nxe4 {Unusually agressive for me against a Qp opening.} 7. O-O Nxc3 8. bxc3 Ba5 9. Qa4+ c6 10. Ba3 Bc7 11. Rad1 {I think that was a mistake as it allows....} b5 12. Bxb5 cxb5 13. Qxb5+ Bd7 {Pawn cover is somewhat blown, but the pieces combining nicely should ensure some degree of latitude.} 14. Qb4 Nc6 15. Qc4 Na5 16. Qd3 {This is where I get sneaky, with a beautifully crafted move (for me).} Rc8 17. Rdb1 Nc4 {Ooops I made a mistake, do you want a free knight?} 18. Qxc4 Bxh2+ {Well, freeish knight. I liked that one. I so often get caught but rarely manage to do it myself.} 19. Kxh2 Rxc4 {Queen to knight up I made the mistake of assuming this game would be fairly gentle.} 20. Rb7 Qh4+ 21. Kg1 Qe4 22. Rb2 {Forced move really, I'm just pottering around having a good poke....} h5 {This is the start of 'the plan' trying to either force through a pawn, or leave the h file with queen and rook. Either way spells trouble for my opponent.} 23. Rfb1 {Not yet worried about rb2-b8 as c4 can go back and help out.} h4 24. Bd6 h3 {White's bishop move didn't seem much of a threat so still pushing that pawn for all its worth.} 25. f3 Qe3+ 26. Kh2 f6 {Getting worried about that b8 square and having my king attacked. } 27. Bg3 Rc8 {Wuss out time ;-)} 28. Nf4 hxg2+ 29. Kxg2 Rxc3 30. Rf1 {Can't see an obvious way forward so I revert to my bad habit of pawn snaffling at any given chance. } Qxd4 31. Ne2 {Forgetting of course that sometimes my opponent is giving me the pawn for a reason.} Qc4 32. Nxc3 Qxc3 33. Rff2 Ke7 34. Rb7 Qc1 {Being hopeful of Q-h8 mate.} 35. Rf1 Qh6 {Ok, how about Q-h3 then?} 36. Rxa7 e5 {The reasoning here, well Q-h3 pushes the king to f2, he is still safe and there isn't much I can do to attack him. So I'm trying to free up the pinned bishop.} 37. a4 Qd2+ 38. Rf2 Qd4 39. Rb7 Kd6 40. a5 Qd1 {Right lets try it again.... move that rook down and I'll show you a little surprise....} 41. Rf1 Bh3+ {Surprise! Mean of me I know, but relieved to actually win it in the end. After nabbing the queen then losing the rook to the fork I was getting blocked out and could see me making too many mistakes.}
