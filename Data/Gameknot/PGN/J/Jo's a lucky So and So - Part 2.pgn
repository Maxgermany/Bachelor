1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Here is another game where I have had oodles of luck!  In this game my opponent has me well under the cosh until he blundered the exchange.  At the time of this blunder my rating was 1698 and his was in the 1770's.  I only needed a draw to get my rating to 1700 so I offered him one and he declined - this turned out to be yet another stroke of luck as I was able to stave off his attack and in the endgame the extra material proved decisive and so instead of 2 points I gain 8.8 points putting my rating back into the 1740s!  The action unfolds with a Queen's Pawn Opening.} d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 e6 {3. ...... e6 - symmetry.} 4. Bd3 c5 5. c3 Nc6 6. Nbd2 Bd6 {6. .......... Bd6 - over the last few moves I have countered in the centre and am ready to castle.  So how do I get into big, big, bother?  Well, if your name is jstevens1 that is sooo easy!} 7. O-O O-O 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. e4 Qc7 {9. ........ Qc7 - so far so good.} 10. Qe2 Bb6 {10. ......... Bb6?! - here is where I start to go wrong as this bishop retreat allows a pawn thrust to e5.  Would a pawn exchange on e4 have been preferable here?  If so there would have been the possibility of Glenda and Frere Lenoir lining up on the b8-h2 diagonal putting pressure on the h 2 square and leaving the possibility of a knight move to g4 to add still more pressure.  But this doesn't happen and a series of exchanges will leave me in Old Matey's shadow on the h file.} 11. e5 Ng4 12. Bxh7+ Kxh7 13. Ng5+ Kg8 14. Qxg4 Qxe5 15. Qh5 Qf5 {15. ......... Qf5 - Glenda answer's Henry's desperate cries for help.  The Wicked Witch of the West is threatening mate on h7.  Glenda could be driven off this square at any time though so quick action is needed.  We are still in the Gameknot 1900  database btw and the line is favourable to white.  However there is a game involving a guy called Bramster who played his bishop to d8, attacking the g5 knight and the game ended in a draw, so I decided to go down that route.} 16. Ndf3 Bd8 17. Nh4 {17. Nh4 - taking me out of the database once and for all.  This move is very strong as it attacks Glenda.  Glenda moves to c2 staying on that vital diagonal.  Thankfully it will take a couple of moves before Glenda must move again and I will have time to exchange Frere Lenoir for that knight on g5.} Qc2 18. f4 Bxg5 19. fxg5 Qh7 {19. .......... Qh7 - Glenda moves to h7 to drive off the Wicked Witch of the West.  White eschews the queen swap and puts a lot of pressure on my position.  My knight makes his way to the kingside to assist Henry and Glenda.} 20. Qg4 Ne5 21. Qg3 Ng6 22. Nxg6 Qxg6 {22. .......... Qxg6 - the remaining pair of knights are swapped off.  I am dreading an incursion of the Wicked Witch of the West to c7 but this does not happen.  She moves back to the h file instead and now I have a rook lift from white onto f3 preparing to swing onto h3 to worry about.  But as you will see, Frere Leblanc will take care of all that!} 23. Qh4 Bd7 24. Be3 b6 {24. ......... b6 - screens out white's dsb and releases my queen rook for action as he will not be tied down to the defense of my a pawn.} 25. Rf3 e5 26. Rd1 e4 27. Rg3 {27. Rg3 - I now have a passer on the e file.  This passer will ultimately bag me the 8.8 rating swag!  Frere Leblanc backs up my weak d pawn on the next turn.} Be6 28. Qf4 Rfd8 29. Bd4 Kf8 30. Rh3 {30. Rh3? - here white forgets about Frere Leblanc and puts his rook en prise.  I take the rook and here I offer my opponent a draw as explained in my introductory note.  He thinks he still has a strong attack so he declines.  However, I manage to deal with it and he must surely regret this refusal.} Bxh3 31. gxh3 Rac8 32. h4 Kg8 33. Rf1 f6 {33. ........ f6 - I think that this move finally swings the game in my favour.} 34. Kh1 fxg5 35. Qg4 Rdf8 36. Rg1 Qf5 {36. ........ Qf5 - I now make him an offer he can't refuse - a queen trade!} 37. Qxg5 Qxg5 38. Rxg5 Rf7 39. h5 Kh7 {39. .......... Kh7 - unpin.} 40. Re5 Rcc7 41. Kg2 Rce7 {41. ........ Rce7 - yet another offer he can't refuse - a trade off of his remaining rook.  I am slowly squeezing out every ounce of counterplay he has.} 42. Rxe7 Rxe7 43. Be3 Rf7 44. h4 Rf3 {44. ....... Rf3 - keeping the enemy king tied down.  But how should I kill him off here?  I know, Henry.  I have carefully calculated that he has enough time to get to g4 to protect my f3 rook and force white to give up his dsb.  Otherwise he will have Glenda to contend with!} 45. Bg5 Kg8 46. Be7 Kf7 47. Bg5 Ke6 {47. ....... Ke6 - it's just two jumps to the right then two steps to the left!  But Henry has not come to do the Timewarp!} 48. Bd8 Kf5 49. Be7 Kg4 {49. ......... Kg4 - after white potters aimlessly around with his dsb, Henry reaches his destination.  He makes no attempt to even get his bishop into place to stop my e pawn from crowning!} 50. Bd8 e3 51. h6 gxh6 {51. ........ gxh6 - white gives up his h pawn - maybe it is to try and break my concentration - it does not wash with me, however.  I just capture the pawn and await white's next move.} 52. Be7 e2 {52. ........ e2 - white doesn't prevent my pawn's advance to e2.  Not only will Glenda appear on the board next move, but it is mate in 3!  He waves the white flag.  This rounds off a nice weekend for me.  Au revoir!  Joanne}
