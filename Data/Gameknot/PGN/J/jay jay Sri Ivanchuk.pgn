1. d4 {Black surrendered, and I still dont see why} d5 2. c4 e6 3. g3 c5 {I dont like playing aganst this move. The result is usually balck accepting a weak pawn on d5, in return for taking the initiative.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. O-O Be7 7. cxd5 Nxd5 {I would have expected 7...,exd5; 8.dxc5; Black has an isolated center pawn, but he also takes the initiave.} 8. Nc3 Nf6 {Another move with the same piece, this should give me the lead in development} 9. Bf4 {Fighting over control of e5, hoping to play Ne5} a6 10. Qa4 {This move took me a lot of thought. After carefull consideration I concluded blacks next move was harmless. } Bd7 11. dxc5 {Whites idea is playing Rd1 and Ne5,  combining forces against d7 and c6; If he can white would also like to keep the c5 pawn, after say 11....,Ne5?!, Qc4;} Bxc5 12. Qc4 {Moving the Queen ou of harms way} Ba7 13. Bd6 {Hoping to pin the black king in the center} Rc8 14. Qh4 Ne7 15. Ba3 {Better is an immediate Ng5, with some tactical play against blacks kingside. THis is one reason the white Queen went to h4} Bc5 {Annihilating the pin, white completely missed this move} 16. Bxc5 {The only way to continue, but much of whites initiative is gone now} Rxc5 17. Ng5 Nf5 18. Qb4 {Hoping to pin blacks king yet again} b6 19. Nge4 {With some ideas of Nd6+} Nxe4 20. Nxe4 Rb5 21. Qa3 {If black noiw play Qe7, he will be in trouble after g3-g4!} Ra5 {White still has a dangerous initiative, but to many pieces have been exchanged. Black has good odds of equalizing} 22. Qd3 O-O 23. Rfd1 {Now back surrendered, saying "I must be blind" The strange thing is he still can play Rd5.  Then we could have 24.Qxa6, Bb5; 25,Rxd5; Qxd5; 26.Qxb6 whcih threatens Nf6+;  Probably black has to accept losing a pawn, but that should be the worst of it  }
