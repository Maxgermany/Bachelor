Be3 {Probably the most solid move.} e6 7. f3 Be7 8. Qd2 {You'd expect me to castle - but I usually don't} Qc7 9. g4 b5 {Let's get started with our attacks.} 10. g5 Nfd7 11. O-O-O {Castles to safety.} Bb7 12. Kb1 {I'm always afraid of Nxb5.} Nc6 13. h4 Nce5 {Planning Nc4.} 14. Qf2 Nc5 {I like to work my knights.} 15. Rg1 b4 16. Nce2 Rc8 {So far, I think I have a slight advantage.} 17. Rc1 Nc4 18. Nb3 {She's reacting to all my moves. Something you shouldn't do unless forced.} a5 19. Nxc5 dxc5 20.

Qg1 {Trying to trade.} Qe5 {! Threatening mate in 1.} 30. bxa3 bxa3 31. c3 {! You may be surprised by this move. But it's not too bad! If Qxc3? Qb6! Guarding mate and attacking my bishop.} Qb5+ {!! The best reply.} 32. Kc2 {She resigned here. I'll let you figure out why. Happy 4th of July!! :)}
