1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {I hate playing against the Sicilian defense as White, but once I open with P-K4, my opponent can force it on me. } d6 3. d4 {The best thing I can do is force a variation of the Sicilian which I feel is bad for Black. If I can play P-QB4, it will negate the effect of Black's opening move.} cxd4 4. Nxd4 {The usual exchange.} Nf6 5. Bd3 {By playing this move instead of 5 N-QB3, I preserve my ability...} g6 6. c4 {...to do this. } Bg7 7. Nc3 {Now I can develop my Knight *behind* the Pawn.} O-O 8. O-O {Both sides tuck their Kings away, and the middle game can begin even though development still needs to be finished.} Nfd7 9. Bf4 {Oops. 9 B-K3 was the correct move. i simply overlooked the fact my Knight was en prise.} Bxd4 10. Nd5 {Another oversight. 10 N-R4 guards the Pawn, which now falls.} Bxb2 11. Rb1 {I *did*, however, see that my Rook was attacked.} Bd4 12. Qg4 {Now that I'm down a piece and a Pawn, I have no choice but to launch an attack. Passive play will surely lose.} Nc5 13. Qg3 {Ducking out of the line of fire.} Nxd3 14. Qxd3 {I have to retake, of course. But every exchange is to my detriment, as it simplifies the position.} Nc6 15. Rb3 {I'm hoping to generate a K-side attack with the Q and R, in conjunction with my well posted Knight and Bishop.} e5 16. Bh6 {The beginnings of a plan. If I can get my Q to KB6... but the problem is that Black's Q is guarding that square. } Re8 17. Qf3 {I move the Q into position. But now what?} Na5 18. Rd3 {Must duck out of the way. It's now 4th and 26, and I'm down to one desperation play.} Nxc4 19. Nf6+ {And the pass is complete! I win the Rook, reestablishing material equality. } Kh8 20. Nxe8 {If Black doesn't retake, I simply retreat the Knight, having reestablished material equality. If Black does recapture...} Qxe8 21. Qf6+ {...I gain access to the crucial square, and have a mate in 1. Black resigns.}
