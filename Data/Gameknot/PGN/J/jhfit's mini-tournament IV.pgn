[Opening "Sicilian (B26), closed, 6.Be3"]

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {I'm going to play the Closed variation against the Sicilian, looking to close off the queenside and attack and win on the king-side---although here it didn't work out that way. But my position was strong enough to allow changes to the plan and still deliver a strong attack.} Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d6 6. Be3 Rb8 7. Nf3 Nd4 {This is pretty much book so far. Rb8 is not the best although it does get the rook away from the g2 bishop. } 8. h3 Nxf3+ 9. Bxf3 Be6 10. Bg2 Nf6 11. O-O Qc8 {...Qc8 was the point of the curious ..Be6 move} 12. Kh2 b5 13. a3 h5 14. d4 h4 {Now with the coming g4, I know he is going to sacrifice the Bishop for the 2 pawns and what he believes will be a strong winning attack.} 15. g4 a6 16. Qd2 Bxg4 17. hxg4 Nxg4+ 18. Kh1 Rb7 19. dxc5 dxc5 20. Rfd1 h3 21. Bf3 Ne5 22. Be2 Rd7 23. Qe1 {Qe1! Simple and effective. If Black castles, there will be no kings-side assault , and if he does not, it's not clear how he can activate the rook.} Qc6 24. f4 {f4! Good enough to secure another slight advantage here as the knight goes to c4.} Nc4 25. Bxc4 bxc4 26. Kh2 Rb7 27. Qd2 O-O 28. Rab1 {The h pawn isn't going anywhere.} Rfb8 29. Kxh3 Bxc3 30. Qxc3 Qxe4 31. Kg3 {Kg3! To prevent ...Qf3+. My king is out in the open and yet is the safest piece on the board.} f6 32. Rde1 e5 33. fxe5 Qxe5+ 34. Qxe5 fxe5 {This sequence of moves by Black gives him a losing position. The doubled and isolated pawns can't all be protected.} 35. Bxc5 Rb7xb2 36. Rxb2 Rxb2 37. c3 Rd2 38. Rxe5 Rd3+ 39. Re3 {Another key move is Re3!} Rd5 40. Bd4 Ra5 41. Re6 Kf7 42. Rf6+ Ke8 43. Rxg6 Rxa3 {Now the king begins his trek over to the queen-side to secure an unusual win. While I'm not eager to see this position again, I'm satisfied with my play in the opening, middle game and the endgame.} 44. Rc6 Kd7 45. Rxc4 Ra1 46. Kf4 a5 47. Ke4 Ra2 48. Kd5 a4 49. Kc5 Ke6 50. Kb5 {And Black resigns.}
