1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Sadly I have to report on a second loss in my MT against the masters.  This is also the second time that I have castled kingside and my opponent has mounted a successful mating attack.  This attack did not result in me copping Old Matey but I lost ruinous amounts of material which was sufficient grounds for me to wave the white flag.  How did this happen?  Well, gameknot analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15890363&fb=1&rnd=0.3149043367856525.} d5 {2. ...... d5 - we both play a double d pawn opening and Dongoodman follows up with the Mason Opening, 2. Bf4.} 2. Bf4 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Nd2 Bg4 5. Ngf3 {5. Ngf3 - both sides develop their pieces rapidly.} e6 6. c3 Bd6 7. Qb3 Rb8 {7. ..... Rb8 - this move is forced, to defend my b7 pawn.} 8. Bd3 O-O {8. ..... 0-0 - In retrospect, I wonder if I was now castling into it (yet again!).  Was Bxf4 an improvement?} 9. Bg5 h6 10. Bh4 g5 11. Bg3 Bxg3 {11. ..... Bxg3?! - apparently GK analysis did not like this move.  I think it is 'cos it opens up the h column.   Henry is certainly gonna need that pair of medieval stockings from Glenda, plus 5 extra wolf pelts, plus some p(r)awn vindaloo in order to keep warm in that draughty castle of his!} 12. hxg3 Kg7 13. Qc2 Ne7 {13. ..... Ne7 - Glenda's steed comes over to the kingside to help in the defense of Henry.} 14. Ne5 Bh5 15. f4 Bg6 {15. ..... Bg6 - trying to keep the position as closed as possible so Fou Leblanc challenges Dongoodman's lsb on the b1-h7 diagonal.} 16. fxg5 hxg5 17. O-O-O {17. 0-0-0 - castling on the opposite side and preparing a line up of rooks on the h column, perhaps?} Rh8 18. Rhf1 Bxd3 19. Qxd3 {19. Qxd3 - the exchange of lsbs was to try and relieve some of the pressure around Henry.  I thought I had things well in control here, particularly as I have a rook controlling the h column.  I just wish I could swap Glenda and my b8 rook around though then I could have got an attack going down the h column onto white's doubletons on the g column.  Alas, I only realised two moves later that it is the F COLUMN that is under the hammer and white exploits this very well.} Rh6 {19. ..... Rh6 - this move is meant to be versatile, to prepare a future doubling of rooks on the g column and to also defend my knight on f6 which is pinned to my f7 pawn.  Yup, the f7 square is certainly gonna be my achillees heel here.  My next move, c6, which turned out to be an outright blunder, was to prepare such a move as Qc7 followed by Rh8.  But white side-tracked me with 21. Qe3.} 20. e4 c6 21. Qe3 {21. Qe3 - which puts my g5 pawn under the hammer and thanks to that pesky white knight on e5 I cannot play Rg6 to defend it.  Hmm, was Rh5 a better try than my plausible but erroneous next move?  You the Inquest Jury decide!} Neg8 22. Qxg5+ {22. Qxg5+ - sssss and double sssss, here comes the Wicked Witch to devastating effect.} Kf8 {22. ..... Kf8 - forced as either alternative king move to h8 or h7 will result in a nasty knight fork on f7.} 23. g4 Rh7 24. Qf4 Qe7 25. Ng6+ {25. Ng6+ - Ouch and double ouch!  A devastating knight fork/discovery combo on Henry, Glenda and my rook on b8 now results in ruinous loss of material.  I waved the white flag after white swiped my rook.  Coach Ion is quite correct, I still need to brush up on my tactics in order to hold my own against The Titans and to retain Class A status.  The only thing I can say is that I fell into the tactical shot under extreme pressure.  I just hope I can redeem myself a little with the white pieces in my return challenge against Dongoodman.  I hope you have a good read and a nice evening.  Bye for now - Joanne} fxg6 26. Qxb8+ {}
