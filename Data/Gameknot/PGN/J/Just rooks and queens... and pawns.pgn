[Opening "Queen's Pawn (A41)"]

1. d4 d6 2. Bf4 c6 3. c3 {On purpose more passive than the overplayed c4. } g6 {Opens holes for my dsb, that I have to use wisely. } 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Nbd2 d5 {Kind a loss of time, but I can understand black' desire to control the center. } 6. h3 Bxf3 {Against the logic, I decided to take with the knight, since it was a little blocked where it was, and it wasn't my intention to play c4. } 7. Nxf3 Qb6 8. Qc2 {Without a lsb, this is harmless, but still I have to control it. } Nf6 9. e3 {Nothing comes from Be5, Nb-d7.} Nbd7 10. Ne5 Nxe5 11. Bxe5 {Normally I take with the pawn, but in this case...} Bg7 12. g4 O-O 13. Be2 {Threatening g5 and BxN... if it is a threat. } Ne4 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 {NOt the best. Now is up to me to solve the Ne4 problem. } 15. Bd3 Nd6 16. f3 {I should have played f4, bravely...} Rae8 17. b3 {I wanted to free my queen from defending b2, and stop the black knight to jump to c4, a deadly move my opponent overlooked. } e5 18. O-O-O {Black has e4, now. My attack has vanished, because of my previous week moves. } exd4 19. exd4 {Well, that was better, but still black has Re3!, probably winning. } f5 {This gives me an idea: } 20. Rhg1 fxg4 {As planned, black doesn't think much about it...} 21. Rxg4 Rxf3 {and greedily takes f3, a very good spot, indeed, but for...} 22. Bxg6 {What can black do now?} Ne4 {To stop the queen, but losing hard material. I wondered here if something like Qg2 could have decided the game right now, but black gets a perpetual as a minimum after Rxc3+.} 23. Bxe8+ Kf8 {...and this is kind of bizarre. I should retreat my bishop on d7? It looks dangerous black's possible Rf2, with a possible counterattack. So I tried to force the game under my terrain. } 24. Rxe4 dxe4 25. Qxe4 {...and I save the bishop, with threat. But it will be not so easy to get out of this. } Rxc3+ 26. Kd2 Qb4 {Ok, now I have +3, but I am under a strong attack, and I doubt I can save the bishop! Very interesting, isn't it?} 27. Qf5+ {I tried to go for a perpetual or something. In the meanwhile, I started to think that simply Ke2 could have be the best one. But it became so tricky and nasty that it was difficult to analyze everything in a blitz. I had to be effective.} Kxe8 28. Qe5+ Kd8 {If black exchanges queens, loses the rook, so he can only hide. If Qb8+, after Kd7 the black queen has no check anymore, and white loses. } 29. Qf6+ Kc7 30. Qf7+ {I am running out of checks... I have lost my bishop for nothing!} Kb6 31. Ke2 Rxh3 {Where the hell move the queen to cover every possible danger???} 32. Qf4 Qc3 33. Qf2 {I decided I could try to provoke exchanges with this, but I was not in danger. Can you tell? But in the meanwhile, my queen is po(i)sitioned...} Qb2+ 34. Rd2 Qc3 35. d5+ {Interesting... attacking from the defence. Kind of rare, and it is the second time in this game. } c5 36. d6 {The little pawn can become a threat... more than the bishop!} Qe5+ 37. Kd1 Rh1+ 38. Kc2 Qe8 {Black seems to have ran out of useful checks, too! Of course, my king is blocking the c column for the rook... my opponent played well. } 39. d7 Qd8 {...but not his queen is badly trapped!} 40. b4 {And this is the attacking move "my stile". I won't betray it anymore! :-)} Rh5 41. Kb3 {The king must threat to join the fry so my rook can eventually move to the c column. } Kb5 {Losing move. a4+, Ka6, and white must find a way to checkmate. But it was so obvious...} 42. Qe2+ {...that I wanted to be sure - so many surprised seemed to deserve this game. } Kc6 {Qd6+ was deadly. I was in bad shape, really!} 43. b5+ {Well, not completely bad, too!} Kc7 44. Qxh5 {Do you want to go on, my friend?} Qg8+ 45. Qd5 {No more surprises, Joe... } Qg3+ 46. Rd3 {...and the checks are over. Now it's curtain... whew! I didn't deserve this one!} c4+ 47. Qxc4+ {}
