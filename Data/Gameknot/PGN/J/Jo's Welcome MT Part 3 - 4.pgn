1. d4 {A beautiful London. I hardly believed it. Specially after losing a game with easy19 in the same tournament, in which I played very, very badly. With this game, I think I mantain the balance... blitzkov will have another chance to crush me, anyway :-)} Nf6 2. Bf4 d5 3. Nf3 e6 4. e3 {When black plays e6, h3 is not really necessary anymore. I like h3 because it supports g4-g5, a standard attack. } Bd6 5. Ne5 {Once Nf6 is played, this knight cannot be kicked anymore - or not that easily. } O-O {A common response is Nh5, to which I'll go Bg3, and if NxB, hxN, I get a free semiopen column. } 6. Nd2 {Better than Nc3, because I want to restrict black's dsb movements. If ever Bb4, c3. } Nbd7 {Black can take the N, but only at the cost of his dsb. And now black cannot play Nh5 anymore. } 7. Qf3 {!? An antinatural move. Another chance is g4 at once. No advantage, but white is where it is supposed to be: attacking. } Qe7 {It seems a normal move, but black "had" to play c5, in order to open his position and activate his pieces. } 8. Bd3 {Another gun over the black kingside. } c6 {Dubious, I'd say. Black wants a solid position, but his lsb stays inactive. I'm already thinking on sacrifices (it doesn't work for a win... still:  9.	Qg3 (threatening Bh6)		Nh5 (a standard defence) 10.	Bxh7+	Kxh7 11.	Qh3		f6 (black cannot avoid white to recover the piece) 12.	Qxh5+	h7-g8 13.	Ng6, winning.   Or:   9.	Qg3		Nh5 10.	Bxh7+	Kxh7 11.	Qh3		Bxe5 (say) 12.	Qxh5+	Kg8 13.	dxBe5		e7-b4 14.	o-o-o		Nc5 15.	Nb3		Ne4 16.	Rd4		Qb5 and white's attack vanishes.  } 9. Qg3 Bb8 {Black guards his bishop on a safe square, foreseeing danger for his dsb.    10.	f4-h6	f6-h5 11.	g3-g4	d7-f6 12.	h6-g5	f6-g4 13.	g5-e7	g4-e5 14.	d4-e5	f8-e8 15.	g2-g4	e8-e7 16.	g4-h5	b8-e5 17.	e1-c1	c6-c5 18.	c2-c3	b7-b6} 10. Bg5 {Much better than Bh6, IMO. Now black is cramped, since it cannot exchange without losing a piece. There are a lot of variations, but the main point is that Nf6 is pinned. } Kh8 {Probably seeking for h6. I think black should have tried Qb4 at once. If I go NxN, NxN; Qh3, f5 and my attack vanishes. (Not BxN because of Qh4, and black cannot defend the king's position). } 11. O-O-O {After some calculation, I decided that there was no reason for hurry, since if I don't exchange pieces, black is cramped. } a5 {I feared c5. This is only a lost tempo, since my pressure against the kingside becomes now stronger, now. } 12. f4 {Again, I had to be patient. This makes my e5 knight free to move. The point of all my attack is to avoid a black knight to be on f6, so I can attack h7. If black exchanges now, in addition to the threat on the pinned knight, I can open the f semicolumn. Anyway, Nh5, trying a queen's exchange, fails because my bishop, after BxQe7, Nh5xQg3, hxNg3, threats the black Rook. } c5 {At last, but a move too late. } 13. Qh4 {Of course, if h6 at some point, I would have played h4, since hxB, hxg5+ was deadly for black. } c4 {I expected this, but my attack is ready to spring. } 14. Bxh7 c3 {The last try. } 15. Nxd7 {The only correct move to win, IMO. I analyzed Nxf7+, too, but after RxN, Bg6+, Kg8, I have to save two pieces and I have no mate. } cxb2+ {Or cxNd2, it would have been the same. } 16. Kb1 {Of course I don't fall for Kxb2.} Bxd7 17. Bd3+ {Of course not BxN, QxB.} Kg8 18. Bxf6 {An mate the next, whatever black does. I guess black has other defences, but how much should we go back to find it?} Qxf6 19. Qh7# {}
