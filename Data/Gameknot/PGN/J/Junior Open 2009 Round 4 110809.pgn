1. g3 b6 {I never know what opening to do when someone pushes g3 or b3 so i just copy normally} 2. Nf3 Bb7 3. Bg2 Nf6 4. O-O Nc6 5. e3 Ba6 6. Re1 e5 7. d4 Bb4 8. Nc3 O-O 9. a3 {He should have taken e5 as i only have 1 piece covering it} Ba5 10. dxe5 Ne4 11. b4 Nxc3 {b4 gave me the opening to take his knight and check his queen} 12. Bf1 {trying to take both my bishops just for his queen, his queen was completely trapped} Nxd1 13. Rxd1 Bxf1 {if am going to love it might as well be for a reason} 14. Kxf1 Qe7 15. Rd5 f6 {I don't know if i should have done this move or not Any problem with it? now that i think about it i should have taken b4 with my bishop, then taken with my knight and put his rook into check i guess... but i don't know} 16. Bb2 Bxb4 {wow and now i do it lol} 17. axb4 Nxb4 18. Rc1 Nxd5 19. Rd1 c6 20. g4 fxe5 21. Nxe5 Nxe3+ {discover check if he takes with pawn} 22. Ke2 Rxf2+ {i was hoping he would take the rook and then i would take his rook and split kf2 and bb2 but he didn't. Now that i look at it i should have moved my queen to (q)c5} 23. Kxe3 Rxc2 24. Rd2 Rxb2 {plan is to kill knight put in check then kill rook} 25. Rxb2 Qxe5+ 26. Kd3 Qxb2 {and then he tips his king}
