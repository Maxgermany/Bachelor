1. e4 {Hi everyone!  Yup, you will come across a scene that is all too familiar.  I get a reasonable game against a Master and look as though I will be able to hold out for a Master Draw then it all goes belly up.  Indeed, I even had high hopes of a Master Victory in this game, particularly as I was the white player in a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  If you are the white player in the Exchange Variation, you should be doing all you can to ensure that you a. keep the existing pawn structure intact and b. exchange down to a K & P ending, as my opponent Paolo, inflicted this on me in my game against him which I annotated as follows.http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  Sadly, although I managed to exchange down to a single rook ending, still keeping the kingside pawn majority while so doing, it was that wretched black rook that turned the game in my opponent's favour.  So the way Ken kept me tied down in that ending until I eventually cracked (I did not want to wait for the executioner like I did against Master Drhpatron - game annotated as follows http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/moving-the-king-in-the-opening?gm=38665) sucked big time - I am really, really trying to break the Experts' and Masters' psychological hold over me.  One day, I just hope it will finally come.  Anyhow, here is the Gameknot Analysis version:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15970775&rnd=0.3195287162576994} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 {4. ...... dxc6 - the first few moves have been the standard moves of the Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  dxc6 is more commonly played than bxc6 for some reason.  Note the pawn structure and visualise it with all pieces bar the kings on the board.  Certainly with correct play, if it is a K & P ending then, provided the WK (in my case, Henry) and the white pawns can move up the board at an appropriate juncture then white should win.} 5. O-O Bg4 {5. .... Bg4 - I remember a comment from Ken in that Paolo game in which he recommended this move for me.  It is an aggressive way to counter the Lopez and prevents for now, Nxe5.} 6. h3 h5 {6. .... h5 - it is very dangerous to play PxB here because it opens up the h column to a black rook.  Now just stick the Wicked Witch of the West on h4 (should the f3 knight evade capture) and white is suddenly in Old Matey's shadow.} 7. d3 Qf6 8. Nbd2 {8. Nbd2 - I concentrate on developing my queenside for the nonce.} Ne7 9. Re1 Ng6 10. d4 {10. d4 - I play it because it is recommended in the World DB but why not exd4 in reply?  Ken decided to pile on the pressure with Nf4.  Now and only now do I get rid of Ken's lsb.} Nf4 11. hxg4 hxg4 12. g3 {12. g3 - this move is played to prevent the Witch from landing on h4.} gxf3 13. Qxf3 {13. Qxf3 - one set of pawns and two sets of minor pieces have been exchanged but I still keep my kingside pawn majority.} Ne6 14. dxe5 Qxe5 {14. ..... Qxe5 - another set of pawns have been exchanged but there is still my kingside pawn majority!} 15. Qf5 Qc5 16. Qxc5 Bxc5 {16. ..... Bxc5 - on initiating the queen trade I moved out of the DB into open play.  Ken develops his final minor piece.  I continue to improve my development - I have to clear the line for Fou Lenoir and the quickest way to do this is to stick my knight on f3 which I do next move.} 17. Nf3 O-O-O 18. Be3 Bxe3 19. Rxe3 {19. Rxe3 - in order to keep my kingside pawn majority intact I recaptured with the rook.  That is another set of minor pieces off the board.} Nd4 20. Nxd4 Rxd4 {20. ....... Rxd4 - Ken also allows his knight to be traded off but at a price - he puts his rook in a dominant position.} 21. Rae1 Kd7 22. Rd3 Rxd3 23. cxd3 {23. cxd3 - now we move into a R & P ending but you would never believe that my position will go south from here now, would you?} Rh5 24. Rc1 Ra5 25. a3 Rb5 26. Rc2 {26. Rc2 - although Gameknot Analysis did not give this as an innacuracy I think this was where I went wrong.  I think, in retrospect, that b4 was called for here.  Do you, the Inquest Jury agree?} Rb3 27. Rd2 {27. Rd2 - passive but the only way to prevent myself from immediately losing a pawn.} Ke6 28. d4 g6 29. Kg2 f5 30. exf5+ gxf5 {30. ..... gxf5 - pawn trade.} 31. f3 a5 32. Kf2 Kd5 33. g4 {33. g4?? - gameknot analysis did not class this as an innacuracy but here I think that shuttling Henry from e2 to f2 was a better plan until Ken showed his hand, but this felt so much like my game against drhpatron that I decided to break out of this passivity.  But it was to my detriment - sigh and double sigh!} fxg4 34. fxg4 Ke4 35. Re2+ {35. Re2+ - wrong plan, g5 had to be tried here.} Kf4 36. Re7 Rxb2+ 37. Ke1 {37. Ke1 - this move should have been played instead of Re7 on the last move according to Gameknot Analysis, but all my pawns will now fall like rotten apples, tears!} Kxg4 38. Rxc7 Kf4 39. Rd7 Ke4 40. a4 Rb4 41. Kf1 b6 {41. ...... b6 - here I decided to wave the white flag as there is no way I will be able to save my remaining pawns.  Ken will be spoilt for choice as to which pawn to crown.  I still have a lot to learn.  Anyhow, hope you have had a good read and do enjoy your weekend.  Bye for now - Joanne}
