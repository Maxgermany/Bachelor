1. e4 {Hi everyone, some of you may have seen this game posted in the general forums but not annotated on gameknot.  Alas, posts do get deleted from the general forums after a while so I thought it was high time to annotate it here, especially as I have recently played another game which involved a player promoting a pawn two moves before me which I will annotate as Jo's Great Escape Part 2.} e5 2. Nf3 d6 {2. ............ d6 - this is the Philidor Defence, it backs up e4 and gives black a solid but rather cramped game.} 3. d4 exd4 {3. ................ exd4 - this is the Exchange Variation of the Philidor} 4. Qxd4 {Ion stated here that he prefers 3.Nxd4 rather than the queen recapture, even if it does mean the knight being moved twice. After 3.Qxd4 Black could have developed with gain of tempo by a timely ...Nc6 (though 3...Nc6 at once is met by 4.Bb5)} Qf6 {Ion stated here - I would also criticise Black's 3...Qf6. You could have done better than to exchange at once on f6 with almost any developing move. Clearly Black wanted to exchange queens. Very well, your queen is protected, let him exchange in his time. E.g. 4.Nc3 (say) 4...Qxd4 5.Nxd4 and you have some threats coming up against the c7-square. 4...Nc6 won't help him much after 5.Bb5.} 5. Qxf6 Nxf6 6. Nc3 Be7 7. Be2 Nc6 8. Bd2 {8. Bd2 - over the last few moves we have been developing our pieces and both sides are now ready to castle.} Bg4 9. O-O-O {9. 0-0-0.  Bad move, allows white pawns to be broken up on the kingside.  ID however says "Be3 instead of 0-0-0 looks fine, covering the d4 square. I don't think, myself, that 0-0-0 was a bad move, but it seems likely the preparatory Be3 might be a better. Not easy to spot since it had already moved a couple of moves ago. "} Bxf3 10. Bxf3 Nd4 {Ion stated here - After 10...Nd4 I rather liked White's anticipation of the opening of the g-file. But sometimes it's worth looking at odd-ball moves. I would certainly look at 11.e5 here, with the idea 11...dxe5 12.Bxg7 Rb8 13.Ba6... Yes, this trades a centre pawn for a flank pawn - not usually a desirable bargain, but here, Black's Q-wing is broken up, and White keeps the bishop-pair. Very hard to assess.  Alternatively Black might play 11...Nxf3 12.exf6 Nxd2 13.fxg7 Rg8 14.Rxd2 Rxg7 15.g3... Black has the bishop for knight, but there are plenty of pawns about, and White's form the tidier set. Again, not easy to assess. But one might consider either outcome at least as good as the game continuation... } 11. Rhg1 Nxf3 12. gxf3 g6 13. Bf4 {Ion stated here - A good alternative to Bf4 is 13.Nb5, which inhibits castling for the moment, and may induce Black to move his K to the d-file. I haven't looked closely into the possibilities, but it looks reasonably promising for White...} O-O-O 14. Bg3 Nh5 15. Ne2 {Ion stated here - Instead of 15.Ne2, 15.Nd5 came into consideration } f5 16. exf5 gxf5 {16. ............... gxf5 - now black's pawns are split but I think black will make better use of the g file than I will.} 17. f4 Bf6 18. Nd4 Bxd4 19. Rxd4 Rhg8 20. Rd3 {20. Rd3?? loses pawn.} Nxf4 21. Re3 {21. Re3 - Bxf4 loses the exchange to Rxg1 .} Nd5 22. Ree1 Nf6 23. Bh4 {23. Bh4 - this move triggers off a plethora of exchanges.} Rxg1 24. Rxg1 Rg8 25. Rxg8+ Nxg8 26. f3 Kd7 27. Kd2 Ke6 28. Ke3 Nf6 {28. .............. Nf6 - inviting me to exchange B for N - no way.  Remember, if you are down a pawn, exchanging into a K & P ending is tantamount to suicide!} 29. c4 {29. c4 - I think this may be called "The Minority Attack" because this may force an exchange of pawns on the queenside.} c6 30. Kf4 {30. Kf4 - keeping Henry, my king well centralised.} h6 31. Be1 Nh5+ 32. Ke3 {32. Ke3 - Henry is pushed back, now black forces an exchange of one pair of pawns.} d5 33. cxd5+ Kxd5 34. Bc3 {34. Bc3 - the bishop gets on to a diagonal which will protect the b pawn so if the knight or king comes over to attack my queenside pawns I can play a3 creating a fortress on the queenside.} b5 35. b3 Ke6 36. Bd4 a6 37. Bc5 {37. Bc5 - blockade.} Nf6 38. Kd4 Nd5 39. b4 Nf4 40. Bf8 h5 41. Kc5 {41. Kc5 - this king march will win back a pawn for me.} Kd7 42. Kb6 Nd5+ 43. Kxa6 {43. Kxa6 - mission accomplished - gets rid of black's remotest queenside pawn as well as winning my pawn back.} Nc3 44. Kb6 Nxa2 {44. ................ Nxa2 - this pawn could not be saved as a3 would be met with Nb1.} 45. Kc5 Nc1 46. Kd4 Ke6 47. Kc5 Kd7 48. Kd4 Ne2+ 49. Ke5 f4 50. h4 {50. h4 - Here Ion stated - At move 50 or (possibly better) 51, it looks simpler to go for the h-pawn with 50.Kf5 or 51.Kf5. 51.Bc4 (ordinarily a desirable move) rather spoils things because after 51...Nc1 White dare not take the f-pawn on account of the knight fork leaving Black a remote passed pawn on the b-file...  F] ... but the ensuing pawn race is quite exciting, and White's drawing method a queen down is very neat - worth studying and adding to one's own technique.} Kc7 51. Bc5 Kd7 52. Kf5 Nc1 53. Kg5 Nd3 54. Bf8 {54. Bf8 - Frere Lenoir must not allow himself to be exchanged off - see my earlier note about K & P endings with a pawn minus.} Ke6 55. Kxh5 {55. Kxh5 - again Henry wins back a side pawn for me.  This h pawn of mine is going to be a vital pawn as you will see.} Kf5 56. Kh6 Ne5 57. h5 Nxf3 {57. .................. Nxf3 - but black goes in front again - sigh!} 58. Kg7 Ng5 59. Kg8 f3 60. Bc5 Kg4 61. h6 Kg3 62. Be3 f2 63. Bxg5 {63. Bxg5 - here I decide to let the black pawn crown as my pawn is only 2 squares away from queening and Frere Lenoir will help protect Henry and the h7 pawn which it will be on the next turn.} f1=Q 64. h7 Qc4+ {64. .............. Qc4  - now comes a series of checks.} 65. Kg7 Qd4+ {65.  Qd4  - after the game had finished I asked Ion whether Black had winning chances in taking my b pawn and he replied "In my view 65...Qxb4 could have been a very good try for the win: 65....Qxb4 66.h8=Q Qd4ch 67.Kg8 Qxh8ch 68.Kxh8 ... Now, the WK is a lomg way from those pawns, and it is Black to play. Try the unsubtle: 68...c5 69.Be7 c4 70.Bb4 Kf4 71.Kg7 Ke4 72.Kf6 Kd4 and I reckon White is busted: 73.Ke6 c3 74.Kd6 (74.Ba3 won't do: 74...Kc4 75.Kd6 b4 76.bc1 b3  /-) 74...Kc4 75.Ba3 b4  /-. Probably White has to begin his K chase at once after 68...c5 69.Kg7 Kf3 70.Kf6 Ke4 71.Ke6 b4 72.Kd6 c4 73.Kc5 b3 74.Bf6 Kd3 75.Kb4 Kc2 76.Kxc4 =. Maybe Black can improve on this (try it and see!), but it's clear White would have had work to do to save the game. Try a king move instead of 68...c5." } 66. Bf6 Qd7+ 67. Kg8 Qe8+ 68. Kg7 Qd7+ 69. Kg8 Qe8+ 70. Kg7 Qd7+ {70. .................. Qd7  - after this move Gameknot posted a message alerting me to the threefold repetition and asking me whether I wished to draw the game.  I clicked on the yes button without any ado whatsoever.  Phew, what a nailbiter.  I have another one in store for you, just you wait and see in Jo's Great Escape Part 2.}
