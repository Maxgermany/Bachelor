1. d4 {Hi everyone!  This is my second game in my match, Jo against The Titans.  It is against my Master buddy Janet.  Things seemed ok until the middlegame when Fou Leblanc got caught in a Noah's Ark type of trap but this time it was on the kingside.  I played on and tried to counter-attack but unfortunately her extra piece proved way way stronger than my pawn and her rook and bishop were enough to ensure that I had to choose between losing ruinous amounts of material or allowing sudden death.  I allowed the latter.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18563516&fb=1&rnd=0.8143384377108815} d5 2. c4 dxc4 {2. .... dxc4 - Queen's Gambit Accepted.  It has been advised that either e6 or c6 is better but accepting the gambit, I thought, allowed a freer or more open game.} 3. e3 e5 4. Bxc4 exd4 5. exd4 Nf6 {5. .... Nf6 - like this.} 6. Nf3 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 O-O 8. O-O {8. 0-0 - at least Henry has not been caught in the centre this time!} Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. a3 Bd6 {10. .... Bd6 - could have played B x N but wanted to keep my B pair.} 11. g4 Bg6 12. Ne5 {12. Ne5 - this makes it impossible to create a bolt-hole with h3?? because of NxB and my f pawn cannot recapture because it is pinned!} Nbd7 13. f4 Bxe5 14. dxe5 Ne4 {14. .... Ne4 - trying to wriggle out of the mess but Fou Leblanc will get trapped all the same.} 15. f5 Nxc3 16. bxc3 Nxe5 17. Be2 Qh4 {17. ...... Qh4 - hoping for a perpetual but Janet prevents this by moving her king forward.  I try and lose my bishop in the most destructive way possible and that is to break up Janet's kingside pawns and to increase my chances of creating a perpetual check later on.  However, Janet ensures that this is not to be.} 18. Kg2 Bh5 19. gxh5 Qe4+ 20. Bf3 Nxf3 21. Qxf3 Rfe8 {21. ..... Rfe8 - cannot avoid the queen trade else my pawn on b7 will fall.  I decided to exchange on my terms by putting a rook onto the e column so that I will be in a position to double rooks on the e column on the take-back.} 22. Qxe4 Rxe4 23. Bf4 c6 24. Rad1 Rae8 25. h6 g6 26. Rd7 Re4e7 {26. ..... R4e7 - this retreat is forced.  If I move my other rook to e7 then Rd8+.} 27. Rfd1 Re7e2+ 28. Kf3 Rb2 {28. ..... Rb2 - hoping to fork the split queenside pawns on the next turn and win back one of them.  Janet does not allow this.} 29. Re1 Rc8 30. Rde7 {30. Rde7 - I expected the other rook to land on e7 but this move is just as good.} f6 31. Rg7+ Kf8 32. Bd6# {32. Bd6 MATE!!  Out of nowhere Janet delivers the coup de grace.  I guess I could have kept both my rooks back but then I would have been subjected to a slow, passive, death. Maybe, if you are behind on material, going out with as many guns blazing as possible is a lot less depressing.}
