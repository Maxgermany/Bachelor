[Opening "Robatsch defence (A41), Rossolimo variation"]

1. e4 g6 {Not surprisingly, Ken responds with the Owen's Defense.  And, I follow through with what I learned and taught milly64, as well as, other students being that 2.d4 is the main response when black only advances a pawn one square, in response to, 1.e4.} 2. d4 Bg7 {I'm not surprised to see Ken complete the fianchetto.} 3. Nf3 {Not sure what to do, I develop with the idea of castling.} d6 {Preparing to advance his Bc8, and possibly, pin my Nf3.} 4. Bd3 {Meanwhile, my focus is continuing to develop and castle.} a6 {Preventing 5.Bb5+ which wasn't my plan, anyway because of what I do next which was my real goal.} 5. O-O Nc6 {Meanwhile, Ken continues with his development.} 6. c3 {The idea behind this move was to connect my d4 and b2 pawns.  As now, I have a solid pawn chain which is useful even in the opening as noted by GM Susan Polgar.} e5 {Of course, Ken tries to exchange pawns.} 7. d5 {But, remembering his advice about exchanging, I refuse.  Instead, I had a different idea, and that was to hit his N for tempo gain.  I also kept in mind that if he doesn't undevelop the N, place it on the rim, or cram it on the seventh rank, I'd win a piece.  With him retreating in an inferior spot, I started feeling comfortable about where I stand.} Nb8 8. Qa4+ {As now, I dish in a check.  I also kept in mind that 8...b5? isn't possible without losing a pawn.} Nd7 {As I calculated him playing this and have a ready answer.  The idea being is that moving his K takes away Ken's chance to castle.  Therefore, this was played, and what I know is that the N is left pinned which is how I intend to keep for the time being.} 9. Nbd2 {Being that the c pawn had advanced, I continue developing.  The idea is finding a better square for my N.  That's generally a good idea, but this way of thinking is where I start to go down.  That's because where I will repost it is going to get me in trouble.} Ngf6 {Meanwhile, just like me, Ken develops and prepares to castle.  } 10. Nc4 {?? But, I thought nothing of it because I just wanted a good square for my N.  However, this is my first blunder as it interferes with my Bd3.  As the B is what prevented Ken from playing 10...b5.  But, with the N there, it is now possible which will result in a fork.  Consequently, I'm about to lose a piece for a pawn or two.  I'm not sure what the best move was, but just about anything was better then what I played.} b5 11. Nxd6+ cxd6 12. Bxb5 {Thinking that I could compensate, I took.  As now, Ken can't take back without losing the R.} O-O {So, he castles, instead.} 13. Bg5 {?? And, I respond by pinning his N.  However, Ken has a ready answer which is more powerful then I thought.  In fact, this loses, as now he is going to win more then just a piece without compensation.  Much better was to retreat my B because of his next move.} Nb6 {I didn't think much of this attack except for just the loss of tempo.  But, as fiercequeen told me, I should've waked up and smelled the coffee here.  } 14. Qa5 axb5 {This is when I first realized that this was a little more then tempo gain.  As I almost played 15.Qxa8??  What stopped me was knowing where Ken's N is placed since he could take.  So, went to plan b.  At this point, I knew that I was lost.  As after I take the pawn, I'm now down the equivalent to an entire piece.  But, it's about to get a whole lost worse.} 15. Qxb5 Ba6 {As I thought that my Q was just attacked.  And, once again, the loss of tempo is the only thing that came to mind.  But, this is a skewer which is going to lose something else.} 16. Qb4 Bxf1 {So, I resigned here.  Even if I take back, I'm down the equivalent to an entire R.  Against someone of my strength or weaker, I might have continued.  But, I don't do for someone a lot stronger then me.  The moral here is that against much stronger players, it only takes one or two mistakes to lose the game.}
