[Opening "Queen's pawn game (A45)"]

1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 d6 3. Nf3 e6 4. Nbd2 b5 {Fisrt burst is from black. An "os√©" move, interesting. Of course I can go e4, attacking the pawn, but then b4, and maybe black can cause the game turn its way, not mine...} 5. a3 {So this was profilactic. I'm not sure black's pawns storm would have been good or bad, should I?} Be7 6. e4 {Black seems not to be in a hurry, so I can take my room in the center. } Nfd7 {Now, this was innecessary. Black could have defended the pawn with a6, or he can even thought about to sac it with b4 at once, while axb will be followed by d5, with no tempo loss because white has to care about his b4 pawn. } 7. Bxb5 {Of course. } O-O {Natural was c6, this is the purpose to leave the Nb8 in b8, right?} 8. h4 {Consolidating the kingside, preparing for an attack. } a6 {Three moves (not BxN, of course!). 9. Ba4, and I keep the bishop preventing the black knight from developing. Good. 9. Bc4, and I prevent black to advance the d or the f pawn. Good. and 9. Bd3, and the bishop is aiming to h7. Good. So it is one of the most difficult moves to do: which is the best? What I am not seeing?} 9. Bd3 {Black is already half-cramped. Ba4 is kind of "naive". Black can move Bb7, Nc6, and that's it. Bc4 has to cope with Nb6... Ba2 or b3, and black wins a tempo to untangle himself. Is tempting, true, to keep control on the diagonal against the king. } Nc6 10. c3 {I want to move e5, but it should be prepared. Ng5, Nxd4 have to be calculated at any moment, so I better waste a tempo in preventing it forever, and... open a square for my queen on c2. } Rb8 11. Qc2 {"Cool". Two in one. } f6 {Clever, since if now e5, f5! and I cannot open the diagonal! Very, very subtle, I liked it! Of course, it opens a hole in e6. } 12. g4 {But I was sticking to my pawn's storm first plan. When the opponent advance its pawns, they become threatable of exchange or else. } Bb7 {Seeing I am not attacking e6, black takes his chance to put the bishop on a very nice diagonal (since e5 is coming). } 13. g5 {Only way to open files. Now black cannot move f5. } fxg5 {The bishop is hanging, ok, but after RxB, if the knight is in g5, it can jump to e6, forking the Q and the R. But the knight has to be in that square, so hxg5 doesn't work. Bxg5, BxB, hxg5 is ok. I choose the risky way, just for fun and for testing my intuition. } 14. Nxg5 Rxf4 15. Nxe6 {Black falls into it. But chess is not simple. } Nxd4 {This sac seems to be meaningless, but look. } 16. cxd4 Qc8 {Qe8, but after Nxc7, Qh5 and black attacks. Now, note that e5 is followed by BxR, and I'm not sure my attack will overwhelm him up to that point. } 17. Rg1 {The knight plays a much better role where it is. I am giving my h pawn, but... who cares? This is almost good for me. And after it, o-o-o (I don't care about the f2 pawn either) is very strong. } Rxh4 {Black thinks correctly that to counter white's rook and to guard h7 is better than to threat f2, but...} 18. Rxg7+ Kh8 {Now, e5 is just fine, but I was playing in "blitz" mode. } 19. Rxe7 {Greedy, wasn't I? Not at all. } Rh1+ 20. Ke2 {This was the plan behing RxB. Not Nf1, because I wanted to have the black rook out of the column first. } Rxa1 {It was probably better to retire the rook. But note that now I am "only" -1. } 21. e5 {And now this is lethal. } Qg8 {Nf8 doesnt work because of NxN.} 22. Rxh7+ Qxh7 23. Bxh7 Rh1 24. Be4 {Or Qxc7. } Bxe4 25. Nxe4 {Not QxB beacuse of Rxb2+. } Rh6 {Black resigns, there is no trick for black. An interesting game, I would say. }
