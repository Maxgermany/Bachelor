1. d4 {Hi everyone!  Another loss in my Masters MT.  I have two games that I need to either win or draw to avoid the dreaded Nul Point.  This was my longest and best game (so far) against Dave Rundle.  I got absolutely trounced in my first two games against him so I am glad to have taken him some distance.  I set out here the Gameknot Analysis version of the game so that you can follow the action:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15904877&fb=1&rnd=0.005913757023437383.  Anyhow, he starts off with 1.d4 and I decided to reply with the Dutch Defense.} f5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 {3. Bg2 - this fianchetto occurs a lot in the Reti Opening, the English Opening and the Dutch Defense in response to the QP opening.} g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 {4. .... Bg7 - of which I fianchetto my own bishop, Fou Lenoir.} 5. O-O O-O {5. .... 0-0 and Henry is tucked away on the kingside.  Thanks to Fou Lenoir and his steed he does not feel the cold ...... yet.} 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 {7. Nc3 - Dave continues to get his pieces out.} Qe8 8. Qb3 Na6 9. Be3 c6 {9. ..... c6 - exploring the possibility of d5 later on.} 10. Rad1 Nc7 11. Bc1 Kh8 12. Bf4 Nh5 13. Bd2 e5 {13. ..... e5 - but it is the e pawn and not the d pawn that gets pushed to black's fourth rank.} 14. dxe5 dxe5 15. e4 f4 {15. ...... f4 - keeping the centre closed but trying to cobble together a pawn storm which does not come off.} 16. Ne2 b6 17. gxf4 Nxf4 18. Nxf4 exf4 {18. ..... exf4 - these trades have exposed the WK a little but allowed white a passer on the e column.  Can Glenda exploit this exposure?  Sadly no.  She is just soooo used to defending, sigh and double sigh!} 19. Bc3 Bg4 {19. ..... Bg4 - pin.} 20. Bxg7+ Kxg7 21. Qc3+ Kg8 {21. ..... Kg8 - now Henry really does need a supply of those good old medieval stockings.  The Wicked Witch of the West and Dave's lsb will have some really good diagonals to put Henry under fire, namely the a1-h8 diagonal and the a2-g8 diagonal, aaargh!} 22. c5 b5 23. Rfe1 {23. Rfe1 - supporting the passer on the e column.} Rd8 24. Rd6 Bxf3 25. Bxf3 Rxd6 26. cxd6 Ne6 {26. .... Ne6 - over the past few moves there have been a couple of trades of one pair of rooks and one pair of minor pieces.  These have proved advantageous to white, sigh and double sigh!} 27. e5 c5 28. Bd5 Kg7 {28. ..... Kg7 - Henry sidesteps the pin but moves onto a discovery diagonal in line with the Wicked Witch of the West.} 29. f3 {29. f3! - this move rules out the possibility of Glenda giving a handy check on g4.} c4 30. Qa5 Rf7 {30. ..... Rf7 - the only move to guard the a7 pawn.} 31. a4 bxa4 32. Qc3 Rf5 {32. .... Rf5 - I can see nothing better.} 33. Qxc4 Nf8 34. e6 {34. e6 - this is very reminiscent of how my game with GM Cyrano ended, only I had the white pieces!} Rg5+ {34. .... Rg5+ - a spite check.} 35. Kf2 Qb8 {35. ...... Qb8 - Glenda is threatening Qxb2+ but the Wicked Witch of the West can deal quite easily with that with a check of her own forcing Glenda to capture her and then the Witch will reappear on c8.  As I will be a whole queen down I decided to resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Here were Dave's comments to this move "...... Qb8 cost you the game! For a long period I was thinking draw but when I played c5 and you played b5 that gave me a chance I would have a look at bxc, I also think Rxd6 caused you problems but I could see why you did it so maybe look at alternatives to Rd8 because that move allowed me to put my rook on d6."    Well played Dave!} 36. Qc7+ Qxc7 {}
