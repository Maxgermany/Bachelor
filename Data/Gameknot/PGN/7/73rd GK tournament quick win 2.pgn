1. e4 {A common move for white.} e5 {A common move for black.} 2. Nf3 {A common 2nd move for white.} Nc6 {A common 2nd move for black.} 3. Nc3 {Going for the four knights game.} Bc5 {Only three knights.} 4. d4 {Loses a pawn.} exd4 {--} 5. Bg5 {A very bad move for white. After 5...f6 either the bishop or knight is gone.} Nge7 {Black missed their chance.} 6. Nd5 {Not the best move. Black can't take the knight because the queen is pinned.} g6 {The losing move. I don't see a move that could be worse.} 7. Nf6+ {White sees the chance to win early} Kf8 {--} 8. Bh6# {An 8 move mate. Remember that this game was played in the casual section of the tournament.}
