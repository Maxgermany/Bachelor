1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. d3 Bb4 4. Bd2 Nc6 5. e4 O-O 6. Nf3 d6 7. Nd5 Bxd2+ 8. Qxd2 h6 9. O-O-O Be6 10. h4 Bg4 11. Be2 {very interesting how an english opening ends where it is not supposed to ends: white attacking on king side and black on queen side...} Bxf3 12. gxf3 {this gave me the excellent approach on g-column} Nd4 {no bother... the usual excellent horse on d4 found out to be unproductive.} 13. Rdg1 {I ignore and continue.} Nxd5 {eliminates the only piece that could have attacked his d4 knight, but who cares?} 14. exd5 Qf6 {interesting. in appearance: protects the h6 pawn and seemingly attacking f3. Actually it does not, because the queen HAS to defend the h6-pawn.} 15. Bd1 {giving me breath for my queen; if i don't do that, she is forced to keep an eye on the bishop.} Nxf3 {hu?} 16. Bxf3 Qxf3 17. Qxh6 {quite logical... I really was surprised black gave me this option.} Qf4+ {totally forced. Only move to avoid mate.} 18. Qxf4 exf4 {and now, black has to lose a pawn} 19. Rg4 {this f4 one...} Rae8 20. Kd2 {preventing Re2} f6 {losing time: there is no way he can save f4} 21. Rxf4 Rf7 {could have spare one move with 20 ... Re7, then R8e8} 22. Re4 {i cannot accept to lose the e-column too easily} Rfe7 23. f3 f5 24. Rxe7 Rxe7 {but I have to concede it temporarily.} 25. Rg1 {Re1 would have lost too many tempos for my king after the exchanges the rooks that would have led to draw} Kh7 26. Rg5 {forcing g6 for a good purpose} g6 27. h5 {this purpose: my h5 pawn is too isolated with my king barred by his rook. So I have to exchange.} gxh5 28. Rxh5+ Kg6 29. Rh2 Re8 {if 29 ... Kg5, then it would have become more difficult to keep the rooks on the board.} 30. Rg2+ {Now I feel better about the f3-pawn.} Kf6 31. a4 {made a mistake here: I should have pushed b4 first.} a5 {that is why: my king is barred over there too... Passing will be much much harder.} 32. f4 {blocking the black king, at least forcing him to many moves before arrifing in front of my f-pawn. Note the e column is very well guarded: e4, e5, e6 are forbidden.} Kf7 33. Rg5 Kf6 34. Rh5 Kg6 35. Rh3 {I was a little bit dry here. Looking for the way to enter. He proposed me twice the draw. I refused at that time, because I needed the entire pawn to assure the first place of the round. If I knew the results of the other games, I may have accepted.} Kg7 36. b3 {now i have some plan, but not sure it will work.} Kg6 37. Rg3+ Kf6 {i needed him to lose some tempo first. this is done} 38. Kc3 Rh8 {this is a bit strange. More constructive would have been to enter on the e-column, on e2 or e1, maybe. But I guess he wanted to refuse me to enter on 8 line.} 39. d4 {alea jacta est. There is no return ticket.} Re8 {dazzling ship.} 40. Rf3 {preventing next move.} Re4 41. c5 {this is a slight mistake: i had no clear plan to make my king pass. Maybe I should have given my d4 pawn by playing b4 axb then Kxb4 Rxd4 followed by Kb5...} dxc5 {i thought he would not do that. } 42. dxc5 {here, I realized he could have obtain the draw not too hardly} Ke7 43. Kd3 {the idea was to threat him with Re3,,, it worked.} Kf6 44. Rf2 {i was thinking about a continuation implying a lot of tempos and I was not sure how I could push him to force the passage -again.} Re1 {thanks: you gave me the line I needed. this moves clearly let me win.} 45. Kc4 {this was one of the equation solved. But i have to recognize that I had no idea how to force it without the previous move.} Re8 {much too late. And what if he played Re4? I would have faced a new threat on b3. blablabla: I would have had to push my c and d pawns... but then, the king, blablabla...} 46. Kb5 {well, now this is it: this is the one move that wins the game.} Ra8 {panicking} 47. Re2 {now I am on e-column, and i will take care of it.} Ra6 {maybe thinking of Rb6 in case of c6} 48. Re3 {so, planning c6 followed by Rb6+} Ra8 {but it wont even happen this way} 49. c6 {now it even is easier.} b6 {the appearance of security.} 50. d6 {there is always a way to destroy a fortress... this is why the fortresses exist. black resigns. I have to recognize that at move 44 I would have considered a draw if he proposes me.}
