1. e4 e5 2. f4 Qh4+ {Bad idea - you will lose time when the queen is pushed back by the pawn.} 3. g3 Qf6 {The knight would prefer to go here, but I suspect this is still the best move.} 4. d3 Bc5 5. Ne2 Nh6 6. Bd2 O-O 7. fxe5 {In general, letting him liquidate your centre like this isn't good. Better to have shored it up with d6 earlier so you can recapture with a pawn.} Qxe5 {Qf2 and Bf2 were both checkmate.} 8. Bc3 Qe8 9. Nf4 b5 {There were better moves, e.g. d6 to get a little central control or Nc6 to develop another piece.} 10. Qh5 g6 {Hangs a piece. White's threat was e.g. 10...a6 11.Bxg7 Kxg7 12. Qg5+ Kh8 13.Qf6+ Kg8 14.Qxh6, winning a pawn and opening up your king. The simplest counter was probably 10...f6.} 11. Qxh6 f6 12. Nh3 b4 13. Bd2 a5 14. a3 Qe7 15. Bg2 Ra6 16. Bf4 d6 17. Nd2 Nc6 18. Nf2 Nd4 19. Rc1 Be6 {19...bxa3 looks to win a pawn or two.} 20. O-O g5 21. Be3 bxa3 22. bxa3 Bxa3 23. Bxd4 {So you lost on time here? You win an exchange back, but you're still worse materially. 2 knights and a bishop (3x3=9) are worth more than a rook and a pawn (5+1=6). Still, well played, barring the knight you dropped on h6. }
