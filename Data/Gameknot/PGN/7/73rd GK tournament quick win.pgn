1. e4 {A common move for white.} e5 {A common move for black.} 2. a3 {This is a waste of a move. It doesn't help develop any pieces or attack the center of the board. The only thing this move does is prevent the bishop from going to b4 later.} Nf6 {--} 3. Nc3 {--} Nc6 {--} 4. Bb5 {--} a6 {--} 5. Bc4 {Another waste of tempo. The bishop moved twice for no reason. } d6 {I would have played 5...Nxe4 6.Nxe4. and then d5. It gives black a good position. d6 only prevents the dark squared bishop from getting into a better position.} 6. Nd5 {A move that doesen't acomplish anything. Another weak move from white.} Nxd5 {That pawn on e4 was just wating to be taken. Oh well.} 7. Bxd5 {--} Bd7 {--} 8. Qf3 {Attempting a mate on f7. The mate can be stoped many ways.} Be7 {Ouch!} 9. Qxf7# {White wins with a simple mate early in the game. Remember that this game was played in the casual section of the tournament.}
