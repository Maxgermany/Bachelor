[Opening "Sicilian (B20), Gloria variation"]

1. e4 {The best chess game I've played to date.  A winning positional battle as black against a very strong opponent.  I can also probably call this my first "perfect" game. As in essentially no mistakes from my point of view.} c5 {Another opening where I get to play my favourite stuff.} 2. c4 {Interesting.  Apparently it's called the "Gloria" variation. My first crack at this variation.} Nc6 3. Nc3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 e6 6. Nge2 d6 7. O-O Nge7 8. d3 O-O 9. f4 {This is turning into a closed game where pawns are positioned like trench warfare. Neither side can safely advance their pawns to any useful extent. I get this pawn formation played against me quite frequently when I play the Sicilian against an opponent of approximately 1700+ rating. Fortunately I don't think I have ever lost when it comes to this position, due to a few reasons.  1) The moment the game breaks open, white's king is in trouble.  2) This becomes a positional battle where each player maneuvers their pieces behind their pawn barrage as artillery support.  I happen to be good at that.  3) While my opponent's position "looks" good and solid, "impenetrable", they tend to let their guard down on defense and concentrate on formulating an attack plan. The thing about these positions is that it's extremely difficult to predict what will happen (or what the opponent had planned in mind) once the position breaks open.  Except maybe for masters and gms who see everything.} a6 {The first step in preparing a b5 pawn push.} 10. Be3 Nd4 {I love blocking my opponent's plans before they even start.} 11. Qd2 Nec6 {Reinforcing my strong d4 knight.} 12. h3 Bd7 {The second step in preparing b5.  This protects my knight from his LSB in case white plays e5.} 13. Rad1 {Most players think massing pieces in the centre is awesome for an eventual attack, but in this game bishops are the more important as they can get in between the pawns.  White's bishops are both oriented in the direction of the queenside, where there's not much important stuff to attack.  My bishops are acting as guardians right now, but their roles will change VERY swiftly.  While white's bishops look more aligned and powerful now, my bishops are the actual threats, as will be seen in the end.} Rb8 {The final step in preparing b5.  White has done nothing to stop it.  Rb7 prevents the g2 bishop from having any threats.  While it may seem to have taken an awful lot of time to prepare b5, it is worth it as white has not prepared any counterdefenses to b5.} 14. Bf2 {I know white is trying to position his pieces to carry out his own plan, whatever it was.  I haven't bothered to find out. However in light of what happens in the future, it does nothing to help, and instead just impedes white's ability to defend against my eventual onslaught. It's a liability white had no way of predicting.} b5 15. b3 {? White invites me to attack the c3 knight and render it useless for the remainder of the game.  While all my pieces are perfectly coordinated in the eventual attack, white's knight is the only thing missing from action.} b4 16. Nb1 {?! What a way to make yourself useless! White was worried about Na4 in that after 16....Nxe2+! 17. Qxe2 Nd4 18. Bxd4 Bxd4+ 19. Kh2 (Kh1) Bxa4 20. ba, leaving white with horrible doubled pawns.  The correct response was 16. Nxd4! bc 17. Nxc6! Bxc6 [if 17. ... cd then 18. Nxd8 Rbxd8 19. Rxd2 and white wins a pawn] 18. Qc2, with a somewhat equal position.  } Qe7 {I am looking at the eventual possibility of attacking white's e2 knight in the event the e pawns clear up.} 17. Nxd4 {White probably sees this and so prevents it.} Nxd4 18. g4 {White prepares f5.} a5 19. Rde1 {White thinks my queen may be susceptible to attack after the pawns clear.} a4 {White cannot take it or else be left with a shattered queenside pawn structure.} 20. Bxd4 {White gets rid of a defender of f5. However this leaves him a move behind as he has to deal with the check first. I see the reasons for this move, but according to the computer analysis it's an inaccuracy.} Bxd4+ 21. Kh1 {? Kh2 is much better since it prevents the eventual checkmate that was inevitable with Kh1.} Qh4 {! This pins the white bishop to the pawn.  White still doesn't suspect Bc6's threats.} 22. f5 {? The results of this exchange allows Bc6 to be disastrous for white, especially with my DSB where it is.} exf5 23. exf5 Rbe8 {! Essentially giving white the delusion that white must take the e8 rook because of my rook +queen both attacking it. A clever trap.} 24. Rxe8 {?? Now Bc6 is unstoppable and both my bishops, queen and rook are all pointed pretty much directly at white's king. White only has 3 pieces to defend against my 4, because of the useless b1 knight.} Rxe8 25. Qf4 {?? Now instead of a large material loss, it's a checkmate. The only defense is Kh2. White still doesn't see the threat of Bc6, and tries to initiate its own attack.} Bc6 {If 26. Bxc6 then Qxh3+ 27. Qh2 Qxf1 28. Qg1 Qxg1#.  If white does anything else other than Kh2, black plays 26. ...Qxh3+ 27. Qh2 Bxg2#.  } 26. Kh2 Re2 {You can calculate the remaining moves. This is my best attack in terms of planning and execution to date!}
