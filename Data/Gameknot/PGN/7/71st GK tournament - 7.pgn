1. Nf3 {once again a lot of fun with a very offensive game due to many mistakes by my opponent. I annotate it because I like to replay the few funny traps I made here. Once again the game has no value in se, but just for the fun of it.} a6 {is this theorY?} 2. d4 d5 3. Bf4 Nc6 4. e3 h5 {well, once again, i guess bluemarble "tries" strange stuff to disturb me} 5. c4 Bg4 6. Nc3 {"I don't care" and i play my moves...} dxc4 7. Bxc4 Nf6 {all my pieces are now developed, my king is about to castle anytime and black is not exactly coordinated. e5 is not an option to open the game... I don't see anything for them, and I will restrict him other possibilities} 8. h3 Bxf3 {chooses to drop his most active piece} 9. Qxf3 e6 10. O-O {i feel very comfortable. Even my queen is not too badly placed.} Bd6 11. Bg5 {i don't mean to offer him the possibility to equal again like in the first game where I made a stupide mistake after having gained a pawn.} Qd7 {once again, bluemarble gives me a pawn... best was to come back with bishop on e7} 12. Bxf6 gxf6 13. Qxf6 {gloup} Rg8 {of course this rook is not really comfortable. And the h5 pawn is too well exposed. I have a few targets here. On the other side, I have to be careful for eventual traps on h3 and g2} 14. Ne4 Rg6 {that is not accurate.} 15. Qh8+ {that is why: if he moves the king, I take the rook. I cautiously calculated that there is no danger for my king to let my queen in a8 in case i have to go there.} Bf8 {but he thinks he has a better defense. } 16. Nf6+ {well, it only loses quality.} Rxf6 {forced or loses queen.} 17. Qxf6 {gloups} Be7 18. Qh8+ {again? I am pointing to the h5 pawn, now} Bf8 19. Qxh5 {gloups} O-O-O {looks like THE move to try something -though it is obviously over here} 20. Rfc1 {let us find some other targets} Be7 21. Qf3 {like this beautiful knight} f6 {he may have thought i was pointing the pawn: i didn't event see it} 22. Bxa6 {and here is the trap of course. We are now two on the knight and the b7 pawn is pinned} Rg8 {open the fire for his own trap that will never come to end} 23. Qxc6 {because we are going to exchange now...} Qxc6 24. Rxc6 bxa6 {all of this for... one more pawn... } 25. Rxe6 {well lets say two pawns} Kd7 26. Rxa6 {well, no, three pawns (though this last one was not in my mind)} Bd6 27. a3 Rg5 28. Rc1 Rb5 29. b4 {limitating all the possibilities} f5 30. f4 {closing doors} Rb6 {?? things get worse and worse for black by simplifying...} 31. Rxb6 cxb6 32. g4 fxg4 33. hxg4 {it is now clear that nothing can stop all this stuff...} Ke6 {but bluemarble just likes to fight. } 34. Rc6 {one last pawn away} Kd5 35. Rxb6 Bc7 36. Ra6 Ke4 37. Kf2 {may be my only mistake here: i could have played Re6+ to make it quicker} Bxf4 38. exf4 Kxf4 39. d5 {that's all folks, thank you} Kxg4 40. d6 Kf5 41. d7 {i said thank you :-)} Kg4 42. d8=Q Kf5 43. Qe7 Kg4 44. Rf6 Kg5 {was he thinking about a mistake to get a draw?} 45. Qg7+ {}
