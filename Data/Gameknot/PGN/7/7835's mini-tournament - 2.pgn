1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. Be2 {The classical approach} O-O 6. O-O c5 {This turns out to be quite a good variation. Maybe time to check my openingsbook???} 7. dxc5 dxc5 8. Be3 b6 9. h3 {theory..} Bb7 10. e5 {theory..} Ne4 {Now it seems like white can get some advantage. Again...maybe i should check my openingsbook, for at first i thought blacks set-up was OK, and now i do get a plus....} 11. Qxd8 Rxd8 12. Nxe4 Bxe4 13. Ng5 Bb7 {if 13..Bxc2? then 14.Bf3 at least wins the exchange (14...Nd7 or 14...Na6 15. Bxa8 Rxa8)} 14. e6 {interesting play!} f5 {Or 14...f6 15.Nf7. After ...f6 black has no pressure against b2/d4} 15. c3 Bf6 16. Rad1 {16.Nf7!?} Nc6 17. Nf7 Rxd1 18. Rxd1 Kf8 {What can black do?? His position is very cramped.} 19. Bf3 {Rd7 coming up!} Na5 20. Bxb7 Nxb7 21. Rd7 {Bisshops exchanged, black still cramped...} Na5 22. Bh6+ Kg8 {Look at this position! The black king is stalemated, white just needs a check and its mate...even without queens mating attacks occur!} 23. g4 {idea: gxf gxf Rd7-d3-g3 and mating} fxg4 24. hxg4 Nc6 {now the g-file will stay closed but the black play is more and more limited.... He has only his knight to play with.} 25. f4 {e5 is mine! g5 is mine! f5 is mine! h5 is mine! d4 is mine! d5 is mine! e4 is mine!} a5 {the black rook can move now, without losing the a-pawn} 26. Rc7 Na7 {only move, 26...Nd8 26.Nxd8 Rxd8 27.Rd7 and black has no counterplay at all} 27. Kf2 {simple strategy: black cannot improve his position, so meanwhile the white king can be activatedb before white actions take place} a4 28. a3 Nb5 29. Rd7 Bxc3 {Despair....but helps to create a nice finish of the game} 30. bxc3 Nxa3 {Simple thinking: N-away, a4-a3-a2-a1Q and wins So white has 5 moves to knot the mating net... FIVE moves,....} 31. Rxe7 Nc4 32. f5 gxf5 33. gxf5 a3 34. f6 a2 35. Ng5 {Now black can queen his pawn. But then 35...a1Q 36.f7  Kh8 37.Re8  Rxe8 38.fxe8Q mates} Ne5 36. Rg7+ Kh8 37. Rxh7+ {37...Kg8 38.f7  Nxf7 39.exf7 CHECKMATE!!}
