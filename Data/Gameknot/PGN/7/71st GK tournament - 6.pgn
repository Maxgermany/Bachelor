1. Nf3 {A good attacking game by my opponent mabar. Congratulations to him. I progressively lost the space... he just conquered it step by step.} c5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nc6 4. e4 {until here, i felt comfy} Nd4 {oh, come on!!! :-) } 5. Be2 Ne7 6. O-O Nec6 {a horse ready to take his pal's place.} 7. a3 {just in case his target was b4} Bd6 {but now i see that he wanted to avoid e5 too. and he is already point to my king.} 8. d3 {freeing my last officer} a6 {don't worry i had no bad intention. Actually, right here, i was already thinking: defense, defense, defense... } 9. Be3 {here, i was thinking: get out, get out, get out.} Qf6 {i guess this scared me. I should have put my rook on b1, calmly and wait for the storm.} 10. Bxd4 {but no...} cxd4 {this was made to eliminate one of my officers from the center for a while.} 11. Na2 e5 {opening the flank for light bishop.} 12. b4 O-O 13. h3 b5 {and I thought this eased my next move...} 14. c5 Be7 15. Nc1 {officer gets back} Qg6 {a new pressure on g2 and h3} 16. Kh2 d6 17. Nb3 {a long way to arrive on d2.} f5 {yes, of course: i had this in mind for a long time, and maybe i should have played g4 sooner...} 18. cxd6 {trying to open a new front.} Bxd6 19. Nbd2 Ne7 {a new officer on my king's front} 20. Nh4 Qh6 21. Nhf3 {a stupid attempt... to lose a tempo} Ng6 {and giving him the time to welcome his officer} 22. Rh1 {gives an escape to the king.} Nf4 {because of this excat move.} 23. Kg1 Rf6 24. g3 Ng6 25. Rc1 Ne7 {the officer has accomplished his work... now he lets the place to the colonel.} 26. Rh2 a5 {GOSH! Now i realize that I lose a pawn and that the bishop will be perfectly positioned. And I still have no countergame...} 27. Rb1 axb4 28. axb4 Ra4 29. Qc2 {trying to find space, coutergame, anything.} Bxb4 {forbidding Nxe5, because of Qxd2.} 30. g4 {i had three moves in mind that occured...} fxg4 31. hxg4 Qf4 32. g5 Rg6 33. Rg2 Bg4 {.... but i forgot that this could happen...} 34. Kf1 {I panicked!} Bh3 {And I lose...} 35. Kg1 Bxg2 36. Kxg2 Qg4+ 37. Kh2 Raa6 {this is beautiful: nothing can prevent Rh6+, gxh, Rxh6+ or x... Even Nxe5 is worthless... Congratulations.}
