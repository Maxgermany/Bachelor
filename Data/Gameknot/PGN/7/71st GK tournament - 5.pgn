1. d4 {so this is my second game against mabar, in the 71st GK tournament. mabar is going to win our group and I congratulate him. But I am happy (if not proud) of this game where I succeeded to force a draw although I really thought my beginning was bad} Nf6 2. e3 {a little bit shy, isn't it?} d5 3. c4 {actually arriving here, mabar is playing with white one of my favorite start...} e6 4. Nf3 {except I would have played Nc3 here} Nc6 {i decided to be prudent for once...} 5. a3 Be7 {so i may look very shy to some of you} 6. Bd3 O-O 7. O-O b6 {until now, i don't see any mistake from my part} 8. b4 {wow! mister shy disappeared!!!} a6 9. Nc3 dxc4 {by playing that, I foresaw situation at the end of move 11, and thought it was good for me} 10. Bxc4 b5 11. Bd3 Bd7 12. e4 {and here i started to foresee the strong attack white could gain on my very last lines especially on c7, d7 and e7.} Qc8 13. Bg5 h6 14. Bxf6 Bxf6 15. e5 Be7 16. Be4 {diagonal threatened + Rc1 threatened + d5 threatened + a4 threatened + Nxb5 threatened... many threats: i am weak} Rb8 17. d5 {first threat} Na7 {protecting b5} 18. Rc1 {second threats} Qd8 19. Qc2 {pretending the attack on diagonal (third threat)} Rc8 {But of course it is c7 that is in mind... Or, is it?} 20. Rcd1 {No, it is not! (brilliant!)} Qe8 {Where can I go, I cryed!!!!} 21. Qd3 {So, why Qd3 and not Qd2? Anyway, my mean fear was now d6, so...} exd5 {i thought it was quite forced.} 22. Nxd5 {My! this is one of the strongest centered attack I have ever seen. Look like a swedish attack in the 1994 world cup, when they arrive at semi-final... (i may be wrong for the date)} Be6 {of course not Bd8: there is no interest in keeping the pair of bishop and emprison all my pieces.} 23. Bf5 {but until then I kept strong optimism: the worst that could happen to me was to lose a pawn...} Bxf5 {eliminating a good bishop, according to my own point of view} 24. Qxf5 {there still was no reason to panic, I though. So, now, I will expell a second strong piece: the knight.} c6 {go away, you fierce horse!} 25. Nb6 {And this is when it occurred to me that d7 was not so well protected, and my rook on f8 was blocked... So i cryed a big Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!} c5 {Here is when I had in mind: ok, i will lose a quality, so I have to find a counter-attack: and i thought about the queen side pawns. I had a good idea...} 26. Nd7 {Rook trapped, as i said. Maybe White could have thought about bxc before going to Nd7, because my rook is still blocked.} cxb4 {go on, take my rook... } 27. Nxf8 {now, I have to decide... Who is going to take back?} Bxf8 {I decided not too brightly, but anyway, we'll see that my choice was not so wrong.} 28. Rd7 {once again, white puses to threat many different things. I don't want to reduce my last rook to defense and I am afraid of Rfd1. So...} Nc6 {I thought he could not take f7, you'll see why. } 29. Rxf7 {white's idea is: he can't take the rook, because I'd take c8... BUT!} Ne7 {hehe! you did not see that, did you? Now, i protect my rook and emprisonned your rook!} 30. Rxf8+ {the best move} Qxf8 31. Qe6+ {And this is why it was the best: white recuperates a pawn!} Kh8 32. Qxa6 bxa3 33. Qxa3 {so as a result, white has still a pawn in front. But black has recuperated air and now has a beatiful b-pawn far from the white king. By now, tension has been very high. From now it will be higher!!!} Qe8 {protecting-attacking} 34. Qb2 {attacking-protecting.} Ng6 {attacking, but mostly threatening Nf4-d3 and b5-b4.} 35. Re1 Nf4 {here is the d3-perspective} 36. Qd2 {of course!} Ne6 {And so I can block his pawn for a while! That was my real purpose.} 37. Qd5 {Hm... i guess he wants to pre-pin my horse, here.} Rc5 {so i intend to active my rook} 38. Qb3 {good thinking: still pre-pin my horse!} Qc6 {protecting-attacking!} 39. Qe3 {protecting c1, preparing an eventual Nd4.} Rc4 {counter-attacking an eventual Nd4 AND preparing b4} 40. h3 {eliminating the threat of an eventual mate on line 1. Good thinking (i whisppered to myself: damn!) :-DD} Kg8 {so, as i am no more pinned, i can go with my king, as it is a future attacking piece.} 41. Rd1 {here is a good move: now it becomes hard to prevent Nd4 and i have to consider Rd6! So i carefully planned the next two moves.} b4 {I want to go to b2!} 42. Rd6 {as planned: good but foreseen! I guess white expected Qc8 from an average player as myself. } Rc1+ {but I prefer Qc4... So i played first this!} 43. Kh2 Qc4 {Hm, i feel good here. See why? I have f4 in mind!} 44. Nd2 {unexpected, but it does not matter} Qf4+ 45. Qxf4 Nxf4 {my king is better place, so I thought it compensates the lack of a pwan.} 46. g3 {unepexcted, because now f2 and f3 are nice target to thnk about.} Ne2 {only possibility... I guess this is why white made this: to force my knight far from e5.} 47. Rb6 {of course! Rb1 and Rc4 are prohibited by the knight.} Rc2 {So, eliminate the knight. But not Rd1, because Nb4 would ruin all possible protection to my pawn!} 48. Ne4 {Now, i cannot play Rc4, because Nd6 would be too strong. And Rb2 would be too passive...} Nc3 {here is what i found best: threatening to take f2 after Rxb4 Nxe4 Rxe4, with check and approaching of the king.} 49. Rc6 {this is good!!!but he cannot take, because the exchanges would lead to a more approaching pawn and a too far king. I have thought considerably to b3 and to Nxe4, but the white rook is still too strong.} Kf7 {So i have to approach more my brave king.} 50. h4 {this is a mistery to me. Except that he might think i am almost on zugzwang? But i am not.} Rc1 {freeing his f pawn, but planning the exchange of the rooks.} 51. f4 Na2 52. Rxc1 Nxc1 {now my idea is that my b pawn will monopolize his knight and my knoght can come back to defense.} 53. Kh3 b3 54. Nd2 b2 {so here i am, the most threatening possible. And this white king that should have come sooner to my pawn...} 55. Kg4 {finally moves forward: he prefers the attack, always the attack! I must recognize that my polish friend is not shy: he is an attacker!} Nb3 {taboo: you take, I win. But I didn't think he was sufficiently a fool and offered draw here. He gently refused and continued for a while} 56. Nb1 {only move} Nc5 {i come back to protect.} 57. f5 Nd3 {refusing the f4 square to the white king.} 58. e6+ {does not care} Kf6 {from here, i will place a ? on every move, and ask for variations from every one of you... I think it is a question of centimeters, and we may have missed something. many times, i thought i could have missed the winning move. } 59. Kf3 {?} Nc5 {?} 60. g4 {?} Nxe6 {I thought only to draw here.} 61. fxe6 {forced} Kxe6 {forced} 62. Ke4 {?} g6 {?} 63. Nc3 {?} Kd6 {?} 64. Kf4 {?} Ke6 {?} 65. Ke4 {it is over and I accept the draw.}
