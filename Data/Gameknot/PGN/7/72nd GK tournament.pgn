1. d4 {Started annotating this around move 25. Started out trying to play the Stonewall Dutch against the d4 opening Never got to play a standard Stonewall  Has been an interesting game - some blunders on my part.} f5 2. e3 d5 {maybe should have played e6 - later was hard to play e6} 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. c4 {went with c6 - could have done e6} c6 5. Ne5 Nbd7 {want to trade off that White Knight on e5 } 6. cxd5 cxd5 {cxd5 was somewhat unexpected - kind of different style} 7. g3 {looks like White will finchetto the white square bishop} Nxe5 8. dxe5 Ne4 {was planning Ne4 at some point anyway } 9. f3 Nc5 {didnot see f3 coming } 10. e4 fxe4 11. Be3 b6 {some protection for the N} 12. Bxc5 {didnot expect White to trade a bishop for a knight,  If I was playing white and wanted to chase the knight, would have considered b4.  bxc5 gives me connected pawns in the center} bxc5 13. fxe4 {Don't want to capture dxe4 - gives me isolated stacked pawns} d4 14. Qf3 {White Qg3 -This is a problem - will be hard to castle kingside and queenside is not appealing} e6 {Wish I had done this sooner} 15. Nd2 Qa5 {Qa5 - not sure if this is a good move } 16. Bc4 Be7 {thinking white could castle resulting in a battery of Queen and Rook - would leave the knight open} 17. O-O {white castles - free knight?} Qxd2 18. Qf7+ Kd7 {I could be in trouble} 19. Qxe6+ Kd8 20. Rf2 {my next move is a blunder.  If white does Rf7 - that would create a lot of pressure on me} Qe3 {While Qe3 pins the rook - did not see the check/attack on the rook - should have traded queens} 21. Qd5+ {I think I am in trouble now} Kc7 22. Qxa8 {Really in trouble now - about to try a hail mary - will trade the remaining rook for a shot at checkmate - Bb7 Qxh8, Qxe4  followed by Qh1# .  If he sees it and does Kf1, will get the rook back} Bb7 23. Qxh8 Qxe4 24. Kf1 {so I will get the rook back after Qh1+} Qh1+ 25. Ke2 Qxa1 {back to -2 - could be a wild game Think I have a shot if I keep up a series of checks with the Queen and the Bishops Have to be careful to avoid another blunder I anticipate Kd3 so that the Rook will defend the b pawn.  Response would be Qd1+ } 26. Kd3 Qd1+ {got to keep checking - could lose the black square bishop otherwise} 27. Rd2 Qf1+ 28. Re2 Qf3+ {continuing with the checks - keeping queen on 3rd rank forces a retreat} 29. Kd2 Bg5+ {get the black square bishop involved - however will lose it as soon as I don't check.  Think I can win both the rook and the bishop for the black square bishop} 30. Kd1 Qf1+ {Kc2 will cause problems for me long term - still think I can win - have to avoid taking the Rook since it is guarded by the bishop - will have to take the bishp first  if Kc2, I will lose the ability to continue the checks at some point - one sceanrio even had black being checkmated - Kc2  Qc1, Kb3 Qd1, Ka3  now what - Bc6 threating mate with Qa4.  That would allow White  Qxg7+ with Q attack on g5} 31. Kc2 Qc1+ 32. Kb3 Qd1+ 33. Ka3 Kb6 34. Qxg7 Bc6 {Will give up the Black square bishop for a shot at checkmate} 35. Qxg5 Qa4# {He takes the bishop but gives me checkmate}
