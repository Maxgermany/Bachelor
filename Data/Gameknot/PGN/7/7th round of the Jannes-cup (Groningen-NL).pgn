1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {A friend told me my opponent played the sveshnikov, an opening I dont know very well. } Nc6 3. Bb5 {Bb5!?   I wouldnt call Bb5 the best move, but from the psychological point of view, the character of the opening changes from very tactical, to positional (mostly) . I dont mind playing all kinds of positions, as long as my opponent feels uncomfortable with it. Another reason is, that i wanted to play a long game, eventually keeping a small  , and then waiting for a mistake. I thought, if i have to play for a win as a maniac, I could do it later as well.  } g6 4. O-O Bg7 5. c3 Nf6 6. Re1 O-O 7. d4 cxd4 8. cxd4 d5 9. e5 Ne4 {A very well known position for so far. I was out of my book at 3... g6 already, but the nice thing about all the Bb5 lines, is that one doesnt have to know all the complicated sicilian lines. The position might not be very exciting, but this could change at ay given moment. Here I had to think for ca. 10 minutes. The Knight on e4 must leave. Maybe I overreacted here, but i came with a pretty original idea.} 10. Bxc6 {It's not easy to give away such a nice bishop, and i had my doubts, whether this move deservs a question- or an exclamation mark. Anyway, there is a deeper idea behin this "silly" move, and that was the only one wich seemed promising to me at that moment. Later on i checked the book and it turned out that Bxc6 has been played frequently on GM-level. (not any given GMs but names as Kasparov and Ivanchuk)} bxc6 11. Ng5 {11.Ng5?! N  I couldn't track this move back in any of my books. Although it looks very simplifying and eventually premature ( In the GM's games this move is played a bit later), I get exactly what I was hoping for. Both of us are out of the book. I still have a playable position. Black has to more problems to solve then white. } Nxg5 12. Bxg5 f6 {12.. f6.  That's the only move in order to make some progress. Otherwise the white bishop paralizes black's development. It's also a direct assault on the white centre, in order to open it up, and let his bishops dance all over the board. Although the white centre looks fragile it's hard to come through, without taking serious risks.} 13. Bf4 Qb6 14. Qd2 {For a short time i thought at Nc3 here, but since it's not neccessary to sac a pawn and the compensation is not clear, i decided to "keep my stuff together". Black could have played 14. ..c5 here, but i dont think he'd like the position after 15.dxc5 Qxc5, with the idea to switch the bishop to d4 after 16. Be3.} a5 {14..a5! A great move. Black sensed that he'd be lost positionally if he'd wait any longer with a5. The threat was Nc3-a4-c5, and white has it all. Now that's not possible because after Nc3, black simply replies with a4! and wins the opening. } 15. b3 {Maybe not the best, but certainly very creative. With b3, white again threatehs Nc3 and there is nothing what would prevent the Knight to reach the best square c5. 15.b3 anyway leads to great complications, but what else should white do in a game he has to win?} a4 16. b4 {One doesnt play b3 if  not willing to play b4 afterwards. } a3 {Again good, and again the only move, since white looks much better after playing a3 himself. The a3 pawn will remain weak till the end, but what to say of his "friend" on b4. Here white has to come with drastic measures, because Ra4 is on his way. Note that Nc3 doesnt work because it leaves the b4 pawn unprotected, and that the continuation Qxb4, Nxd5, Qxd2, Nxe7 loses a piece after Kf7} 17. exf6 {Suicidal, one would say, since white opens the centre, while instead of taking care of his undeveloped pieces, but this is the best move, with good practical chances, and with a nice idea behind it. } Bxf6 {Bxf6, is the only way to take the pawn back because exf6 would probably cost the game after Bd6! followed by Bc5 where white has the control and all the time in the world to "pick up" the a3 pawn. } 18. Be5 {The next moves seem to be forced.} Ra4 19. Bxf6 exf6 20. Nc3 {We reached the critical point. Here Black has 2 choices. The best move is Qb4, but i think that white has enough compensation after Re3. Now Qxd4 is not so great since it looses the exchange due to Rd3!, and white can block the "bad pawns" on c6 and d5. If not Qxd4 then the rook has to move, what gives white enough time to double his rooks, and eventually play Rg3 trying to organize an not to be underestimated attack with eventually h4-h5 etc.} Rxb4 {I took a deep breath when i saw what black played. Although it doesnt look dangerous, suddenly white is better. } 21. Re7 {A great shot, and a big shock to my opponent. After Qxd4?  Qh6 decides, and almost after all the other moves. g5 doesnt help much in view of Qd3, f5..and now since there is a black pawn on f5, Qh3 wins. Probably black should have played Rf7, but white's attack gains on strength after Rae1. } Qd8 {Chosing the "safest" way. But..} 22. Nxd5 {And black is in complete shock. He probably thought that this move is not to be considered, because after taking his rook away..for example to a4, there are 2 of white's pieces "hanging". But then he noticed that the e7-rook is temporary covered and that Qh6 is killing again. That's why Rb7 is the only move, and also a very ugly one to play.} Rb7 23. Rxb7 Bxb7 24. Ne3 {Now white is clearly better, but there is still a long way to go. } Qd7 {We reached some kind of an endgame, although the queens are still there. c5 was also considerable, but i dont doubt white's advantage after d5. At this point both of us were in slight time trouble. } 25. Rc1 {Not Rd1.. No reason to be afraid of Rd8, as we shall see. Rc1 is more active. Although having struggled a lot with my development, i finally brought my last piece in to play. I got exactly what i was hoping for. A position where my opponent has a couple of weaknesses (a3, and c5... his bishop is more a pawn then a bishop), but no counterplay at all.} Rd8 26. Qc3 {A good move, indirectly covering the d4 pawn because of the threat of Qb3 .} Kg7 {The best square for the king.} 27. Qxa3 {Yes, white wins material. Qxd4 doesnt work again, coz this time white can win the bishop by another queen-check. Qe7 } Ra8 28. Qb2 {I had 5 minutes more here, and i was a pawn up. Qb3 was probably better, because the rook cannot come to a4, but i thought "let's keep the man busy and let him think, not trying much until move 40."..and indeed he accepted the complications again. } Ra4 29. Nc4 {Complicating, the way i like it. Black has to think again, how to justify Ra4.} c5 {c5! not because he achieves something with the move, but mostly because the bishops is back at the board again. } 30. Nb6 {Transposing into a probably won ending.} Qg4 {Note that Qc6 would have lost to d5! followed by Nxa4. -} 31. f3 {A multifunctional move. The kings can escape, it sets a small trap trying to seduce white to try out Bxf3. Maybe he'd overlook that g2 is covered by the queen and i could win his rook i thought. With time trouble, one has to be practical in first, and everything else in second place. Anyway, my trap didnt work of course, and we got the ending i mentioned already. } Qxd4+ 32. Qxd4 Rxd4 33. Rxc5 Ba6 {In view of Rc7 . } 34. a4 Rb4 35. a5 Rb5 {?? Now black is lost. He should have kept the rooks on the board. But with a flag to fall one has the need to simplify. The rest is not so interesting any more. I didnt play very accurate and could have won quicker but i shall show it to the bitter end. } 36. Rxb5 Bxb5 37. Kf2 Kf7 38. Nd5 Bc6 39. Nb4 Ba8 40. Ke3 Ke7 {the time control was reached, but there was not much left to play for.} 41. Kd4 Kd6 42. Nc2 h5 43. Ne1 g5 44. g3 f5 45. f4 gxf4 46. gxf4 Be4 47. Nd3 Kc6 48. Nc5 Bc2 49. h4 Kb5 50. a6 Kb6 51. Kd5 Bb1 52. Kd6 Bc2 53. Kd5 Bb1 54. Ne6 Kxa6 55. Ng7 Be4+ 56. Ke5 Bf3 57. Kxf5 Bg4+ {A bad move but with less then a minute it's not a miracle. White will not have the time to mate, but that makes no matter. I was very glad with how i handled the pressure before, and during this game. Finnaly i should mention that both of us had 1 hour and 45 minutes for the first 40 moves, and 15 minutes each for the rest of the game. I hope u enjoyed it as much as I did. If someone finds an improvement, i'd be happy to hear it, coz i didnt put it in the computer yet. Also i hope to hear why someone rated the game the way he did. Have a nice day folks } 58.
