1. e4 {A nice miniature} e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 {Fried liver attack} Bc5 {I have been dying to play this variation for ages now} 5. Nxf7 {Better is Bxf7+} Bxf2+ 6. Kxf2 {Again not recommended. Play is just too wild if white takes on f2 and white usually comes off worse} Nxe4+ 7. Ke3 {Again not the best continuation. this just exposes the king to too much attacking combinations.} Qh4 {Now white needs to make the correct move or he will be sorry.} 8. Nxh8 {??? Wrong move. Mate is now unavoidable.} Qf4+ {Both Ke2 and Kd3 lead to mate. If Kd3 then Nb4+ Ke2 Qf2#  If Ke2 then Qf2+ Kd3 Nc5+ Kc3 Qd4#} 9. Ke2 {White chosses the option that holds out longest} Qf2+ 10. Kd3 Nc5+ 11. Kc3 Qd4# {Hope you enjoyed this quick game. Played in one day :)}
