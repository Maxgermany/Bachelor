1. e4 {My best ever miniature game to date.  } e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 {Petrov defence.} 3. d4 {I like to play openly hence this central thrust. } exd4 4. e5 {Kicking the knight.} Ne4 5. Bd3 {Developing my bishop and preparing to castle.  I was expecting black to play 5.  d5 here.  } Bb4+ {But an aggressive response.  } 6. c3 {Might as well sac another pawn.} dxc3 7. O-O cxb2 {And another!} 8. Bxb2 Nc5 9. Nc3 {Completing my development of my minor pieces.  } Nxd3 {Black takes my light squared bishop.} 10. Qxd3 {And I recapture.} O-O {I really like my position here.  Lots of open lines and no defenders near my opponent's king!} 11. Nd5 {Attacking black's one developed piece.  } Ba5 12. Nf6+ {Time to sac the knight!  } gxf6 {Forced as otherwise Qxh7 mate. } 13. exf6 h6 {Trying to prevent 14. Ng5 threatening mate.} 14. Ng5 {But I play it anyway. } hxg5 15. Qf5 {Now the threat is Qxg5+ and mate on g7.  } Bd2 {Protecting g5.} 16. f4 {Threatening Qxg5 again and clearing a path for my rook to come to f3 and h3.  } Be3+ {A delaying check.} 17. Kh1 Bxf4 {Desperation. } 18. Rxf4 {Another sacrifice to clear the way for a final attack.  } Kh8 {Hoping to allow Rg8 but it's too late.  } 19. Qxg5 {The final position.  Nothing black can do to stop Rxh4 mate and Qg7 mate is also threatened.  Hope you enjoyed!  }
