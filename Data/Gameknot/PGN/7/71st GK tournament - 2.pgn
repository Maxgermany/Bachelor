1. e4 {I found out to play solidly here to try to earn the  2nd place in this 1st round of 71st tournament. I did not have the pretention to be 1st, due to the excellent quality of the favorite.} c5 {became my favorite move against e5...} 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 {Najdorf} 6. Bd3 {quiet version} g6 7. Be3 Bg7 {will authorize me to castl king side, which is not common in Najdorf} 8. h3 {white is decisively not agressive. I was supposed to be the favorite of this game. This may explain. But at that level of the game, I said to myself: come first, I want to draw here and win with white. (actually I lost with white...)} Bd7 9. O-O b5 10. Qd2 O-O {I feel solid here... } 11. Bh6 {This sounds strange to me, because white forces are unsufficient to attack my king.} Nc6 {So i continue to develop} 12. Nf3 Rc8 {and I continue} 13. Bxg7 Kxg7 14. Nd5 {without the dark-square bishop, this Knight is less dangerous than it looks like.} e6 {But I needed to free my queen; in compensation my d6 pawn is weakened.} 15. Ne3 {Now white forces are more like on the "good side"} Qc7 {But I'll make the action happen on the other side.} 16. c3 Na5 17. Rac1 Bc6 {pointing the center pawn,} 18. Ng4 {actually good defense. I thought a lot about what I could do, after having gained the precious e5 pawn.  A good old mate: Nxe5 19 Qh6+ Kg8 20 Ng5... hehehe} Nxg4 {so this sounds more than logical} 19. hxg4 {and creates a first weakness to white.} Rfh8 {my toes on both sides.} 20. Qg5 {Booh! said the queen.} h6 {well... I am not really scared. } 21. Qh4 Nb7 {21 ... g5 is out of question, to my opinion. It would allow the queen to win a tempo. Instead, I recuperate the knight for the center.} 22. Rfe1 Nc5 23. Bb1 e5 {f4 and d4 prohibited. this structure of d6 and e5 is stronger than it looks. } 24. Qg3 {the queen became really passive here. } Qe7 25. b3 Ne6 {I still had a passive plan here, though I considered my situation better than his. But, if I remember correctly, I still had not lost the other game at that time and did not feel the pression to win here.} 26. c4 {I think this is not a very clever plan by white.} bxc4 27. Rxc4 {taking with the b-pawn would have been worse.} Bb5 28. Rcc1 Rc7 29. Rxc7 Qxc7 {I freed my position here, thanks to white, I admit.} 30. Nd2 Nd4 31. Bd3 {decisive for me.} Qc3 {I now can exchange the queen by tripling his pawns.} 32. Bxb5 Qxg3 33. fxg3 {Oh, boy, this is good.} axb5 34. Nf3 {hoping the exchange} Ne6 {I wont give it to you, of course. My knight will be very strong later.} 35. Rc1 {attacking all the pawns, potentially.} Rd8 {But they are already all protected for a while} 36. Rc6 Rd7 {preparing the eventual Nc7 to protect b5} 37. Rb6 Nc7 38. a4 bxa4 39. bxa4 {This is the last threat by white. If it does not succeed, it is over.} Ne6 40. a5 Nc5 41. Nd2 Ra7 42. Rb5 Kf6 43. Kh2 {white had no real counter game. The Knight is confined to defense and the rook too. I guess he expected me to play Kg5.} Ke6 {but i preferred to accumulate force on the center.} 44. Kg1 Ra6 45. Kf1 Kd7 {and now, a5 is doomed.} 46. Ke2 Kc6 47. Rb6+ Rxb6 48. axb6 Kxb6 49. Nc4+ {last baroud} Kc6 50. Ke3 Kd7 51. Nb6+ {compensating check} Ke6 52. Nd5 {trying a repetition of moves, I guess.} Nd7 53. Nc7+ Kf6 {but i have sufficient places.} 54. Ne8+ Ke7 {Here, on Nc7, I would have answered with Nf6 and I can progres further... There is nothing more White can do to impeach my further advance: King will be confined to protect g4 -or lose it- and knight will be pursued by my king until this arrives to c4 or d4. white resigns}
