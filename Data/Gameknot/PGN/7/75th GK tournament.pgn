1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 O-O 5. f3 d6 6. Be3 Nbd7 7. Qd2 c5 8. d5 {Nge2 is more flexible. Nh3 is also playable.} Ne5 {...a5 is also possible here.} 9. g4 {A bold and slightly risky move, but logical now that the centre is closed.} e6 10. h4 exd5 11. cxd5 Re8 12. h5 a6 13. hxg6 fxg6 14. Be2 b5 15. a3 Bb7 16. Nh3 b4 17. axb4 cxb4 18. Nd1 a5 19. Nf4 Bc8 {A bad move. Black should take on g4 immediately.} 20. b3 {Too passive. White should push on with his attack. 20.g5 is winning.} Nexg4 21. fxg4 Nxe4 22. Qc1 Bxa1 23. Qxa1 Ng3 {The losing move. 23...Nc3 would have put Black in a strong position.} 24. Nxg6 Re5 {If Black plays ...Nxh1 he gets mated.} 25. Nxe5 Nxh1 26. g5 Qf8 {After 26...dxe5 27.Qxe5 Black's weakness on the black squares leaves him helpless.} 27. Ng4 Bxg4 28. Bxg4 Qg7 29. Be6+ Kf8 30. Qf6+ Qxf6 31. gxf6 Rd8 {This loses quickly, but the result is not in doubt at this stage.} 32. Bh6+ Ke8 33. f7+ Ke7 34. Bg5+ {}
