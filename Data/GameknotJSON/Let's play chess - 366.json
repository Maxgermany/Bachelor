        "1. Nf3": "Greetings! This is my first annotated game, simply because my adversary had a high rating, so beating him became my record. Actually, as I noticed, he's not a genuine 1700 rating range type of player, because he got it by winning over others players having the 1200-1600 rating range. Anyway...He started the development with the king side knight.",
        "1... Nf6": "When we started the game, I was at the end of the \"learn how to open\" phase. Back then, I responded with the same king side knight. I no longer do that... :)",
        "2. b3": "Yada, yada, yada, the typical opening, continued by Bb2, Nc3 and a short castle.",
        "2... g6": "Same here.",
        "3. Bb2 Bg7 4. c4 O-O": "His majesty goes to a safe place.",
        "5. g3": "Okay, so he intends to dominate both long diagonals...",
        "5... Nc6": "Back in the days I used to go Nc6 before c5. Nowadays I do it the other way around.",
        "6. Bg2 d6": "I open up my white bishop.",
        "7. d3": "A strange move...or maybe I'm just not illuminated enough. :)",
        "7... e5": "Taking control of the center.",
        "8. Nbd2": "Okay, now I get it...he's coming for my king.",
        "8... Ne7": "So, in response, I attack it as well...:))",
        "9. e4": "Nice move, it passed my attention, I'm pretty much blocked there with the traveling knight...I can't and won't go back to c6...I would look like a fool...",
        "9... c5": "Blocking.",
        "10. O-O": "Finally, he puts his suveranity into safety.",
        "10... a5": "Attacking...the wrong side, but still attacking...",
        "11. h3": "???",
        "11... Nc6": "Eventually, I get where I want with both the c pawn and the queen side knight.",
        "12. a3": "Okay, so now he controls the entire 4th rank...so what? :)",
        "12... Qb6": "Placing your queen on the enemy king's diagonal, especially in a \"waiting, to errupt\" type of attack, is always good.",
        "13. Rb1": "He thought I wanted to achieve something on that file.",
        "13... Be6": "I'm just developing my pieces...that's all.",
        "14. Re1": "He's preparing for war with the heavy pieces.",
        "14... Rab8": "Mee too.",
        "15. Nf1": "The only possible square for his queen side knight.",
        "15... Rfe8": "Face to face, cowboy! Heads up!",
        "16. Ne3": "And here we go!",
        "16... Nd4": "Back at you!",
        "17. Nxd4": "He accepts the exchange...",
        "17... exd4 18. Nd5": "Theoretically not a bad move...",
        "18... Bxd5 19. cxd5": "The exchange takes place, we both have doubled peasants.",
        "19... Qa7": "I open up some space for the b pawn.",
        "20. f4": "Pressurising my king side, heh?",
        "20... Nh5": "Hoping to get that g3 pawn...not the best of moves by the way.",
        "21. Qf3": "It's not gonna' happen', not today...",
        "21... b5": "He's out as well.",
        "22. g4": "WTF?!? I didn't see this coming.",
        "22... c4": "Realising that moving the knight back to f6 will make only worse, because of g5 or e5, I give him something to think about on the other side.",
        "23. bxc4": "He calls my bluff, instead of taking my knight.",
        "23... bxc4 24. dxc4": "Not the best move, I'd say, when his king is on my queen's diagonal. ",
        "24... d3+": "Bang! He overlooked this one...",
        "25. Kh1": "Okay, that will do.",
        "25... Bxb2": "Bang-bang!",
        "26. gxh5": "It's too late, mate, especially when my black bishop is in the nearby of a possibly promoting pawn.",
        "26... d2": "Bang!",
        "27. Red1 Qd4": "With a single move, defending two pieces...God, I love and hate queens...:))",
        "28. hxg6": "Trying to fork my king and rook.",
        "28... fxg6": "No way, dude!",
        "29. Qe2": "The only sane solution to the situation.",
        "29... Bxa3": "Only because it evened out the material standings.",
        "30. Rxb8 Rxb8 31. Rxd2": "Okay. In this move there's the key to the game. I was kind of afraid that he will take it with the queen, which would have been the good move. Now I can check his majesty.",
        "31... Rb1+": "He can defend with three pieces or run.",
        "32. Kh2": "He runs. Bad for me...:)",
        "32... Qg1+": "Run Forrest, ruuuun!!!",
        "33. Kg3 Bb4": "Not achieving any progress in checkmating him, I start an attack with a good positioned bishop.",
        "34. Rc2": "Didn't understand why did he chosed that specific square...",
        "34... Re1": "Run queen, ruuuun!",
        "35. Qf2": "Nice, opened up the e3 square for another check.",
        "35... Re3+ 36. Kg4 Qd1+": "And so on...I was hoping he would put some pieces between, but he preferred running.",
        "37. Kg5 Qh5+": "My king at f7 would have been nice...",
        "38. Kf6 Bc3+": "I'm sorry mate, but I want to checkmate you.",
        "39. Rxc3": "Didn't think he'll sacrifice it, but he had an ingenious plan all along, as you'll see...",
        "39... Rxc3": "The fool me exploits the situation, without anticipating his next move.",
        "40. Qb2": "Bang!!! WTF?!? Imminent checmate against my king or losing the rook? I didn't see this coming...",
        "40... Qh4+": "I was lucky, I managed to think a way out of the situation.",
        "41. Ke6 Rxc4": "For material advantage, clearing the c file and perhaps because of promotion danger.",
        "42. Qb8+ Kg7": "The only possible square to run to.",
        "43. Qb7+": "Draw by threefold repetition, mister?",
        "43... Kh6": "No way, today I'm winning!!!",
        "44. f5": "The second big wrong move from my opponent, not seeing that if we both accept the exchanges, the e file will free up.",
        "44... gxf5 45. exf5": "From this move on, I'm going after his queen.",
        "45... Qe1+ 46. Kf6": "Blunder, blunder, blunder...",
        "46... Qe5+": "Only square to go is f7.",
        "47. Kf7 Qg7+": " He resignes, because of my skewer upon the king against his queen."
