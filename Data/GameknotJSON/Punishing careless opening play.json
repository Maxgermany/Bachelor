        "1. e4 d5": "This game was in a Scandinavian Defense mini-tournament. \n",
        "2. exd5 Qxd5": "The main line. \n",
        "3. d3": "?! Not a book move and very passive, blocking the light squared bishop. More common is 3.Nc3. \n",
        "3... e5": "Taking control of the center. \n",
        "4. a3": "? Wastes a tempo. ...Bb4+ is not a threat here. \n",
        "4... Nc6": "Continuing with development.\n",
        "5. Nc3 Qe6 6. h3": "? Another tempo waste.\n",
        "6... Nf6 7. Bg5 Be7 8. Bxf6": "? Gives up the bishop pair for nothing.\n",
        "8... Bxf6 9. Qe2": "? Blocks in the f1-bishop even further, and allows my next move.\n",
        "9... Nd4": "Violates the principle, 'Move every piece once before you move any piece twice unless there is a tactic,' but this move does not lose a tempo because white's queen is forced to move again and keep an eye on the c2 square. My knight position improves, but white's queen position does not, so this is a free beneficial move.\n",
        "10. Qd2 Bd7": "Preparing queenside castling. I want my rook on the d-file.\n",
        "11. Nge2": "GK computer says this is an inaccuracy because of 11...Bg5 12.Qd1 f5, but what if 12.Qxg5? Then 12...Nxc2+ wins a rook, but there likely would be tactical complications with open lines on the kingside and the a1 knight trying not to get trapped. I considered 11...Bg5 but preferred a lead in development, pressure, active pieces, and the bishop pair to being up the Exchange with complications.\n",
        "11... O-O-O": "Should I have played 11...Bg5? Is it better?\n",
        "12. O-O-O Rhe8 13. Kb1": "?! Wastes a tempo in my opinion. I would have tried to get the f1 bishop out via g3, Rg1, and Bg2.\n",
        "13... Bc6": "This move turns the f1 bishop into a tall pawn on the 1st rank, and clears the path of the d8-rook.\n",
        "14. Nxd4": "Logical move, trades a 2nd rank knight for a 5th rank knight.\n",
        "14... Rxd4": "I recaptured this way to make my rook more powerful.\n",
        "15. f3": "The f1 bishop is completely useless now.\n",
        "15... Red8": "Doubling rooks to increase the pressure on the d-file.\n",
        "16. Be2 h6": "Threatening 17...Bg5 then ...f5 and ripping open the center.\n",
        "17. Qe1 Bg5": "Unblocking the f-pawn to prepare ...f5 and an attack in the center.\n",
        "18. Qf2 f5": "As planned.\n",
        "19. h4 Be7": "I changed plans and now target white's king.\n",
        "20. g3": "Trying to restrain the kingside/central attack.\n",
        "20... b5": "Pawn storm. My pieces' activity and open lines compared to white's passivity and blocked pieces means that my king is safe while white's king is not.\n",
        "21. Rhe1 b4": "Logical follow up.\n",
        "22. Na2": "? Computer says best was 22.axb4 Bxb4 and only a small disadvantage for white.\n",
        "22... bxa3": "Ripping open white's king shield.\n",
        "23. b3 a5": "The a-pawn prepares to advance and attack the weak b3-pawn.\n",
        "24. Bf1 a4": "Attacking. My advantage is 3.56 pawns.\n",
        "25. b4": "? Best was 25.Nc1. This costs white about 1 pawn worth according to the computer.\n",
        "25... Bxb4": "26.c3 fails to 26...Qb3+.\n",
        "26. Ka1": "?? Loses to the computer recommended next move.\n",
        "26... Bxe1": "?? Logical move: attack the king, win material, simplify, then win the endgame. But better was 26...Qc4!! and 27.dxc4 loses so computer gives best play as 26\u2026Qc4 27.Kb1 Bc3 28.dxc4 Rxd1+ 29.Nc1 Rxe1 30.Qxe1 Bxe1.\n",
        "27. Qxe1": "Loses the f3 pawn but it makes no difference already.\n",
        "27... Bxf3 28. Rb1 e4": "If 29.dxe4, then 29...Rd1!\n",
        "29. Qe3 Qf6": "Preparing a discovered check.\n",
        "30. Qe1": "?? 30.c3 was much better according to computer.\n",
        "30... Rd4xd3+ 31. c3 Rd3d1 32. Qf2": "If 32.Rxd1 then 32...Rxd1+ wins a queen for a rook.\n",
        "32... Rxb1+ 33. Kxb1 Qb6+": "?? 33...Rd1+ and mate in 12! But simplification is good enough to win.\n",
        "34. Qxb6 cxb6 35. Ba6+ Kc7 36. Nb4": "Opponent resigns.\n"
