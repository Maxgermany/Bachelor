        "7... Nf6": "Is ok. You're thinking, what if moves e5?",
        "8. d4": "Take that pawn! What if he moves it again to d5? You have to move your knight, and you lose momentum.",
        "8... O-O 9. Ng5 Be6": "You've blocked in your pawn on e7. Also, now his move to d6 captures a minor piece for him.",
        "10. Bxe6 Qb6": "This move seems like a blunder. He took a minor piece, and you didn't take it back when you could. f7xe6",
        "11. Bf5 gxf5": "This you should not have done. It's what he wanted you to do. You've broken your main defense piece of your castle.",
        "12. exf5 Bh6 13. Ne6 Rfe8": "Take the knight with your pawn? f7xe6. But more important, move your king to h8, and slide your rook over to g8 to protect the column. But, the main mistakes were made earlier.",
