        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nTwo games finished recently, one which involved me being on the receiving end of a successful mating attack and in the other game I was the one to dish it out.  Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first Ladies and Gentlemen.  This game is my 36th against Master Freddy and the outcome is becoming far too much of a ritual for my liking.  We pick up the action on move 5 where Freddy puts his king on e7.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5 5. Bxf7+ Ke7": "5. ...... Ke7 - the popular choice in this tournament.",
        "6. Bb3": "6. Bb3 - Freddy played that move against me in my game against him with the black pieces so I thought I would play it.",
        "6... Rf8 7. d3 h6": "7. ....... h6 - here Freddy shows me the right time to play h6.",
        "8. Nf3 Qe8 9. Nc3 d6 10. h3 Bd7 11. Qe2": "11. Qe2 - all fairly normal looking development from white.",
        "11... Kd8 12. Bd2 Nd4 13. Nxd4 Bxd4": "13. ....... Bxd4 - knight trade.",
        "14. O-O-O": "14. 0-0-0 - and I think I have castled into it.",
        "14... a5": "14. ....... a5 - and now we get some standard castled-position busting stuff from Freddy - a pawn run down the a column.",
        "15. a3 Kc8 16. Rhf1 Nh5 17. Nd5": "17. Nd5 - turns out to be a time-waster.",
        "17... a4 18. Ba2 c6 19. Nc3": "19. Nc3 - would Ne3 have been an improvement?",
        "19... Nf4 20. Bxf4 exf4": "20. ...... exf4 - B for N trade.",
        "21. f3": "21. f3? - I think this is where I went wrong, I now leave the g2 pawn weak and Freddy does make a target of it.",
        "21... Qe5 22. Qe1 Qg5 23. Qe2": "23. Qe2 - the usual dire role for Glenda, defending the g2 pawn.",
        "23... Rf6 24. Rfh1 b5": "24. ..... b5 - Freddy does not put his rook on g6 as I expected so I play h4 preparing h5 to stop this.  When Freddy misses a chance to win a pawn it does not mean an oversight - it may be a very bad sign - that he is after your king! ",
        "25. h4 Qe5 26. Qe1 b4 27. axb4": "27. axb4 - virtually forced, the only alternative was to play Ne2 but that fails to Bxb2+.",
        "27... a3 28. Kb1 axb2": "28. ..... axb2 - a novel way of trying to hide Henry, behind Freddy's pawn - he cannot take his own pawn, haha!",
        "29. Ne2 Qb5 30. Nxd4 Qa4 31. Kxb2": "31. Kxb2 - but Henry must take on b2 and now my horsie and Fou Leblanc perish.",
        "31... Qa3+ 32. Kb1 Qxa2+ 33. Kc1 Qa1+ 34. Kd2 Qxd4": "24. ....... Qxd4 - like this.",
        "35. Ke2 Ra2 36. Rc1 c5 37. bxc5": "37. bxc5 - I take what I can.",
        "37... Ba4 38. cxd6 Rxd6": "38. ...... Rxd6 - material is even but not for long and look at those heavies swarming around Henry.",
        "39. Kf1 Bxc2 40. Qd2 Rc6 41. Ke1": "41. Ke1 - short of moves.",
        "41... Kd7 42. h5 Rb2 43. Rh4": "43. Rh4 - dreaming of a kingside counter-attack ....",
        "43... Bxd3 44. Qxf4": "44. Qxf4 - this allows Henry to meet his usual fate at the hands of the Wicked Witch of the West but I think I was busted anyway, do you the jury agree?  Anyhow, part 2 is coming up .....",
