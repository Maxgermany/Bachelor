        "1. d4": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis game had echos of my previous game against Master Janet in which she gave me an exchange sac in the middle game and later on, Henry got caught in a mating net on the d column.  A similar thing happens in this game, only this time, just like the times Steve Backshall managed to evade the bees, hippos and alligators (taking photos at the same time!) and get back to the truck, Henry manages to escape from the clutches of the Wicked Witch and find sanctuary on the a column.  I end up being a whole rook up and with Bob's mating attack completely burnt out it was only a matter of time before I forced a queen swap and ensured safe passage for a pawn to get to Glendadom before Bob waved the white flag.  So, how did this happen?  Well, you can follow the action by the Gameknot Analysis link below.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15462595&fb=1&rnd=0.16887384178856135",
        "1... d5 2. c4 dxc4": "2. .... dxc4 - after Bob starts with a Q pawn opening, I decided to play the QGA as it gives me more open play and I feel a little less vulnerable to passivitis.",
        "3. Nc3 a6 4. a4": "4. a4 - to interfere with b5 - if b5 then PxP and my a6 pawn cannot recapture due to the fact it is pinned against my a8 rook.",
        "4... Nc6 5. e3 Na5": "5. .... Na5 - with the possibility of putting a knight in on b3.  As is now, my steed backs up my extra pawn on c4.",
        "6. Nf3 Nf6 7. Bd2 e6": "7. ...... e6 - opens up the a3-f8 diagonal for Fou Lenoir.",
        "8. Ne5 Nb3 9. Bxc4 Nxa1 10. Qxa1": "10. Qxa1 - and here we have another exchange sac.  Will this one work?  Only time will tell.",
        "10... Bb4 11. O-O O-O 12. Qc1 Nd5": "12. ..... Nd5 - I must counter in the centre to completely avoid being over-run.",
        "13. Nxd5 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 exd5 15. Bd3": "15. Bd3 - quite a few exchanges here, but white could have a very dangerous attack going against Henry even though Bob has castled on the same wing.",
        "15... Qf6": "15. ..... Qf6 - so out comes Glenda the Defender!",
        "16. Qc2": "16. Qc2 - ouch - my c7 pawn and my h7 pawns are both en prise.  I do not want the Wicked Witch of the West deep into my position so it will have to be the h7 pawn to jettison.",
        "16... c6 17. Bxh7+ Kh8 18. Bd3 Qh6 19. f4 Kg8": "19. ...... Kg8 - as Bob's mating attack gathers pace, Henry prepares for a Deadly Dash towards the queenside.",
        "20. Rf3 Rd8": "20. ...... Rd8 - my rook gives Henry the room to do so.",
        "21. f5 Qd6 22. f6 gxf6 23. Rg3+ Kf8": "23. ...... Kf8 - and so the race against time is on.  Can Henry make it?  Only time will tell.",
        "24. Nxf7 Kxf7 25. Bg6+ Ke7": "25. .... Ke7 - Bob has given up his knight for the f7 pawn but has he overreached himself?  Maybe.",
        "26. Bh5 Rf8 27. Qh7+": "27. Qh7+ - Henry will get out of check by going to d8 but is he safe there?",
        "27... Kd8 28. Rg8 Rxg8 29. Qxg8+": "29. Qxg8+ - Henry must leg it again, as much as his tired old body will allow - thank god his partiality to a seafood diet has kept him fit.  Also, Bob only has his queen and lsb to get hold of Henry so it looks as if he will get his much needed sanctuary.",
        "29... Kc7 30. Qf7+ Kb6": "30. ...... Kb6 - made it!",
        "31. Qh7 Qb4": "31...... Qb4 - at last, Glenda defends her other half, aaaaah!  She is also thinking about obtaining more p(r)awns for Henry's table tonight - there are two really juicy ones on a4 and b2 and she is mentally compiling a list of ingredients for a p(r)awn seafood mornay!  Can you see something else that Glenda is also eyeing up and do you see a dark, dark, shadow of that Chessic Grim Reaper hanging over Bob's king?  If so, on what square is he about to descend?",
        "32. h3": "32. h3 - to create an escape square for his king, but now Glenda just starts gathering in those p(r)awns!",
        "32... Qxb2 33. Kh2 Qb3": "33. ..... Qb3 - forking two pawns.",
        "34. a5+ Kxa5 35. Qc7+": "35. Qc7+ - because my pieces inter-defend one another this check is merely a spite check.",
        "35... Ka4 36. Qe7 Bf5": "36. ...... Bf5 - on MOVE 36 I finally complete my queenside development.",
        "37. Qxf6 Be4": "37. ..... Be4 - after the Wicked Witch turned my weakie pawn on f6 into dust, I have designs on the g2 square.",
        "38. Qf2 Qc2": "38. ..... Qc2 - trying to force an exchange of queens.",
        "39. Qg3 Qxg2+": "39. ..... Qxg2+ - Bob tries to duck the exchange but I exchange anyway even though Fou Leblanc will be given up for the g2 pawn.  This leaves Bob with just his king and bishop and three pawns.  I have a rook and four pawns at my disposal.  White is lost and can only try for a stalemate.",
        "40. Qxg2 Bxg2 41. Kxg2 Kb4": "41. ..... Kb4 - Henry now makes way for my a pawn to proceed to Glendadom.",
        "42. Be2 a5 43. Bd1 a4": "43. .... a4 - the best Bob can do is give up his bishop for my a pawn, but I have my b pawn who will get to Glendadom instead.  Meanwhile my rook will prevent a white pawn from ever going to the 8th rank.",
        "44. h4 a3 45. h5 a2": "45. .... a2 - just one move away from Glendadom but Bob now waves the white flag.  Commiserations Bob, you gave me a terrible scare in the middlegame but somehow Henry escaped and I am just sooooo relieved.  Coach Ion and Gameknot analysis will not hesitate to point out just how Henry managed to get away!"
