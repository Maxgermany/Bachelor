        "1. e4 e6": "This is the French Defence. I used to play it a lot, so I know what is coming.",
        "2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4": "This is something different than the closed positions arising from moves like 3...Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 etc.",
        "4. Nxe4": "This called Rubinstein Variation. ",
        "4... Nd7 5. Nf3": "I can also play 5. Bd3 which can lead to the same kind of positions than in this game.",
        "5... Ngf6 6. Nxf6+": "I practice I have to exchange the knights anyway. For example, 6. Bd3 Nxe4 7. Bxe4 Nf6 8. Bd3 etc.",
        "6... Nxf6 7. Bd3": "There are other moves here that I could play, such as Bg5, c3, Be3, Bc4 etc. The one that I selected takes the e4-square and potentially targets h7.",
        "7... c5": "This is logical. Black challenges the central control by attacking d4.",
        "8. O-O": "I could take on c5, but instead, I move the king to a safer place. There is a little tactical trick that makes this possible, although d4 is threatened.",
        "8... cxd4": "Black takes it.",
        "9. Nxd4": "And I take back! 9...Qxd4 would be followed by 10. Bb5+ winning the queen.",
        "9... Bc5": "So Black develops a piece with tempo.",
        "10. Nf3": "Keeping it simple.",
        "10... Qc7": "Now I cannot pin the f6-knight.",
        "11. Bg5": "I still move the bishop to g5, because other active squares are covered by Black pieces. I also have the option to break Black's kingside pawn structure.",
        "11... O-O 12. Qe2": "Breaking the pawn structure here is probably not worth losing the bishop pair.",
        "12... b6": "Preparing to bring the bishop to b7.",
        "13. Ne5": "This is a good square for the knight.",
        "13... Bb7 14. Rad1": "The rook takes the open file.",
        "14... Nd5": "I do not like this move. Bringing a rook to oppose mine on the d-file would be better, I think.",
        "15. c4": "Driving the knight away.",
        "15... Nb4": "This seems like a good move, but it is not.",
        "16. Bxh7+": "Surprise! Black steps into a trap.",
        "16... Kxh7": "What else?",
        "17. Rd7": "This is an important move.",
        "17... Qc8": "The queen must retreat.",
        "18. Bf6": "Making it more spectacular than necessary. 18. Qh5+ Kg8 19. Bf6 also works.",
        "18... gxf6": "If Black does not take, White delivers checkmate anyway. For example, 18...Kg8 19. Qg4 g6 20. Qxg6!! fxg6 21. Rg7+ Kh8 22. Ng6#",
        "19. Qh5+": "Not the fastest way to win. 19. Rxf7+ Rxf7 20. Qh5+ Kg8 21. Qxf7+ Kh8 22. Ng6#",
        "19... Kg8": "19...Kg7 is not better. ",
        "20. Ng4": "This is a bad move which allows Black to defend a bit longer. Instead, 20. Nxf7 wins: 20...Bxf2 21. Rxf2 Kg7 22. Qh6+ Kg8 23. Qh8# or 20...Rxf7 21. Qxf7+ Kh8 22. Qh7#",
        "20... Qxd7": "This returns the favor. Instead, 21...Be7 22. Rxe8 Qc5 23. Nxf6+ Kg7 24. Rxb7 Qxh5 25. Nxh5+ etc. and there is no checkmate, although White is two pawns up and probably winning.",
        "21. Nxf6+": "And it is over.",
        "21... Kg7 22. Qg5+ Kh8 23. Qh6#": ""
