Kf1 Kf8": "\nHere the lesson begins:how to lose a draw game...Why I didn't think to play Be7,hitting the b pawn?It would have to move,and I could have control both pawns,with 35...Bc5.At the same time his f2 pawn would have to be protected by King or left to its fate...\nIn e7 the bishop  would have been on the right diagonal to control the a pawn.\nThen we could have:\n34...Be7 35.a5  bxa5 36. bxa5 Bc5 (and white can only hope in a pawn)37. Ke2 Kf8(now the King goes toward queen side to block black King)38. Kd3 Ke7 39. Kc4 Kd6 39... Bxf2?? 40. Kd5! and King goes to the right way)40. Kb5 Bxf2.So black King blocks the white King to the king side,white pawn will never pass the case a7,and nothing can be done from white bishop.",
        "35. Ke2": "White King wisely advances",
        "35... Ke7": "Again here:Be7!But my King decided to block his poor bishop...",

        "37. Kd3 Kc6": "Try to advance,but...",
        "38. Bd5+": "He make me recede",
        "38... Kc7 39. Kc4 Kb8 40. Kb5 Ka7": "Dear reader,here you can understand that I have no idea how to play endgames...my King,instead of face the enemy King,with Kc7,scared of him,like a coward soldier,recedes,and almost stoop and let the way to him!\n\n\n",
        "41. Kc6": "And triumphantly black King takes possession of the case c6!",
        "41... Kb8": "Again Be7!And if  42. a5 bxa5 43. bxa5 Ka6! And still it's draw,since black captures pawn a5 by King when he wants,then the bishop will go in d2 and then in f4 defending the king side pawns.White will capture f6,but will be not able to do something in the king side.\nIf instead 42. b5 Bb4!\nBut after this move,41...Kb8 black cannot do anything .",
        "42. Kd7 Bc7 43. Ke6": "here b5 better,black would have had a zugzwang,and any move would lose a piece.",
        "43... Bd8 44. Kd7 Bc7 45. Ke7": "Finally I resigned.\nI hope this lesson is helpful for me and for some of you."
