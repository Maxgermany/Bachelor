        "1. e4": "My first game against tag1153. Striving to play an open and tactic game.\n\n(The above note is my thinking at the time playing the game. Notes like this is post-game notes)",
        "1... d5": "Scandinavian defense challenging the center very aggressively . Trade mark move by tag1153.",
        "2. exd5": "White grabs the pawn.",
        "2... Qxd5": "Black retakes with the Queen.",
        "3. Nc3": "White develops with tempo. Black will move to the a-file setting up a future pin on whites King.",
        "3... Qa5": "A book move for black.",
        "4. d4": "Grabbing the center. Mental note: \"Must have plan to defend it later...\" \n\n(Which failed... you will see soon.)",
        "4... c6": "Creating a retreat option for the Queen expecting white to set up a discovered attack with Bd2...",
        "5. Bd2": "And here it comes...\n\n(This is where white leaves book moves and proceeds to loose the d pawn. The book move should have been Nf3)",
        "5... Qd8": "Attacking d4. The Queen have moved three times in the opening. White will soon will have three pieces developed compared to blacks zero...",
        "6. Nf3": "Three developed pieces. White wants to castle quick and open up the board.",
        "6... Bg4": "Developing the Bishop and setting up a pin.",
        "7. Be2": "White develops preparing to castle instead of threatening the Bishop with h3. I am calculating to loose the pawn on d4 with BxN BxB QxP. But I see that as a gambit as I will have all my pieces developed compared the blacks single Queen, and I will own the two Bishops in an open game.",
        "7... Bxf3": "Black takes the Knight.",
        "8. Bxf3": "And white takes the Bishop.",
        "8... Qxd4": "And the Queen eats the pawn and black is a pawn up...",
        "9. Be3": "Castle or attack? Attack of course! If black accepts trade of queens, white will have a rook on d-file.",
        "9... Qxd1+": "Well... There goes the white Queen.",
        "10. Rxd1": "And there goes the black Queen. Sanity check. Pluses: White have four pieces developed and owns \"the two Bishops\" (which is considered worth 0.5 pawns), and owns the d-file. Minuses: White lacks central pawns. \nPlan: White will have to attack swiftly if he wants to exploit the lead in development.",
        "10... e6": "Opening up for black Bishop and grabbing a piece of the center.",
        "11. O-O": "Castled and fully developed. Now white have to figure out how to exploit the lead in development.",
        "11... Nf6": "Developing Knight and black is one move closer to castle.",
        "12. Rd3": "Preparing to double up on the d-file.",
        "12... Nbd7": "Developing the second Knight to central defensive position.",
        "13. Rfd1": "Double up on the d-file. White now has all pieces developed and all are placed centrally.",
        "13... Be7": "Develops black Bishop to a defensive position and black is now ready to castle.",
        "14. Bg5": "Attacking the defender of the Knight on d7 (i.e. if white takes Nf6, the other black Knight is free lunch for the Rook). The text will create a pin on the Knight on f6 when black castles.",
        "14... O-O": "Black castles and is nicely tucked in behind his pawns and has defendable position. The text enhances the pin on the Knight at f6.\n\n(This is the position where white has a winning combination... Can you see it? I didn't...  Scroll down for a small hint.\n\nHint: One black piece is attacked twice but only defended once...)",
        "15. Ne4": "Bring another attacker in. Attacking the pinned piece.\n\n(My good friend ChessMaster 10th Edition ;-) helped me with this winning combination: RxN, NxR, BxB. Now Nd7 is attacked by Rd1 and Rf8 is attacked by Be7. Black Rook can't move to defend the Knight so black has to give up either Knight for nothing or Rook for Bishop.)",
        "15... h6": "Black wants to simplify...",
        "16. Bh4": "White doesn't. (The threat to take is often more effective than the execution.) White is opting to keep the tension up.",
        "16... Rfd8": "Black challenges the d-file and brings in another defender for the Knight on d7. Analysis: White own more space. Black has a solid defense. How can white improve the position or attack? \nPlan: I'll try to create an outpost on d6 for my Knight. Grabbing space at the same time...",
        "17. c4": "Space grabbing... with the target square of c5. Where the pawn will park and give support for a Knight outpost on d6.\n\n(This is where white looses the initiative and lets black run the game...)",
        "17... g5": "Space grabbing with threat. It also breaks the pin on f6. Bravo! But it also opens up the kings defense...",
        "18. Bg3": "Retreating, giving black the initiative... White did have the choice to trade a Bishop or Knight for two pawns, but didn't think it was a good trade. I expect another space grabbing pawn stab: g4.",
        "18... Nb6": "But the pawn stab didn't come. That would have weakened the defense to much. Instead black opens up for some reduction in material and attacks the undefended pawn at c4. How can I exploit the fact that Be4 looks overworked? (I.e. it's pinned to the defense of both Nf6 and Rd8.)\n\n(Blacks bishop is in fact not overworked, as the two guarded pieces are on the same diagonal)",
        "19. b3": "Defending c4, stopping any Knight movement on the queen side and grabbing space.  If black takes Rd3, white retakes and will still own the d-file.",
        "19... Nxe4": "Black is keeping the initiative and trades a defensive Knight for an active Knight. If white takes with Bishop, it's posted on a more active diagonal (b1-h7).",
        "20. Bxe4": "White takes the Knight, but sees a pawn storm on the king side. Black can play d5! before or after trading rooks.\n\n(This is the position where black misses a winning combination.\n\nScroll down for a hint...\nHint 1: Whites black Bishop is almost trapped. How can you get to it? You need two moves, and the first needs to be forcing. Scroll down for another hint\nHint 2: Push a pawn...)",
        "20... Rxd3": "Black simplifies still with one pawn up.\n\n(\"ChessMaster recommends d5\" (you know how it sounds ;-) threatening white Bishop and when the Bishop retreats. d6 and the black Bishop is trapped... I saw the threatening d5, but didn't stop to calculate the effects as can be seen on my previous note.)",
        "21. Rxd3": "White retakes. Can't find any intermezzo moves.",
        "21... Rd8": "Black wants to simplify even more.",
        "22. Rxd8+": "White needs to activate the King very soon and start trading down pawns so that the two Bishops get room to maneuver.\n\n(White is complying to blacks plan to reduce material while being a pawn up) ",
        "22... Bxd8": "Analysis: White has two Bishops, black is on an active diagonal h2-b8, white on b1-h7. Black has a black Bishop and a Knight, has some space advantage and is one pawn up. \nPlan: Activate the King and clear some space (i.e. remove some pawns) to be able to utilize the Bishop pair more effectively?",
        "23. f4": "Open up for the King and offer a trade of pawns.\n\n([?] The text turns out to be a blunder and the loosing move.)",
        "23... Bc7": "(!) Nice move by black. White looses the two bishops. Black will get a passed protected pawn and white will have doubled pawns...",
        "24. fxg5": "White has to comply. The other options are not any better. White hopes to get a more active king than black.",
        "24... Bxg3": "As expected",
        "25. hxg3": "The only response.",
        "25... hxg5": "Now black has a protected passed pawn... not a pretty sight if you play white. White wants to keep black pawns on white squares where they can be attacked.",
        "26. Kf2": "Centralizing the king",
        "26... f5": "Pushing the pawn with tempo",
        "27. Bd3": "Retreating",
        "27... Kf7": "Centralizing king supporting the passed pawn",
        "28. Ke3": "White is aiming toward the queen side. It's the only counter play that exist. Aiming for d4, c5 and d6.",
        "28... Kf6": "Supporting passed pawn.",
        "29. Kd4": "As planned",
        "29... Nd7": "Moving the Knight to an active position and stopping the white king from entering the queen side.",
        "30. b4": "Trying to execute my counter play on the queen side.\n\n(The following moves till the end where played quite fast, ca 30 minutes for all moves.)",
        "30... e5+": "Pushing the passed pawn with tempo...",
        "31. Kc3": "Giving up my central position",
        "31... e4": "Pushing the passed pawn with tempo, again...\n\n(At this point I considered to trade the Bishop for two paws, which still would (most probably) have been a lost game for white. But a bit harder for black. In hindsight I should have tried.)",
        "32. Be2": "(At this point I had already mentally given up. But my fingers hadn't realized it yet so I kept on moving my pieces) ",
        "32... Ke5": "Centralizing the King.",

        "34. Bh5": "(Didn't really know what to do)",
        "34... cxb4+": "Forcing my King even further away from the center but it can support my queen side attack.",
        "35. Kxb4": "Retakes the pawn and the King is way off from the passed black pawns...",
        "35... Kd4": "Supporting the passed pawns.",
        "36. Kb3": "(Going the wrong direction abandoning the plan for counter play)",
        "36... Nb6": "White will loose a pawn...\n\n(Here my fingers caught up with my brain and I finally realized I had lost. I resigned.)"
