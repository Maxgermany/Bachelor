    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e5": "Correct or not, I tend to assume opponents in certain ranges are more familiar with 1...e5 and feel responding with a more aggresive opening gives an unfair advantage.",
        "2. d4": "Center game.  An opening I'm not familiar with, but one that seems vunerable, especially when white recaptures with the queen.  I'm sure someone can prove me wrong, but I don't like moving my queen so early.",
        "2... exd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6": "Forcing the queen to move a second time, hoping to gain tempo.",
        "4. Qe3 d6": "I don't like to move my queen early, Bb3 c3 seemd to be a waste (though now I see it has it's own name), and Nf6 e5 looks bad.  I probably should have played Be6, but decided on d6 to prevent e5 and free my white bishop.  Jeremy Silman says that e5 is a mistake for white and that an early d6 is a sign that black doesn't know the opening (which I've already stated).  :)",
        "5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bd3 Ne5": "Blockading the pawn, though probably not wise.  I think I wanted to prevent white from opening the b1-h7 diagonal after I castled.  If white had replied with f4, I would have traded pieces.",
        "7. f3": "This prevents Nf3 and weakens the e1-h4 diagonal, though I don't see a way to take advantage of it.  White's kingside knight didn't emerge till move 28 and the rook never stirred.  Either Nf3 or f4 would have challenged my center knight and given white much better chances.",
        "7... Be7 8. b3": "Preparing to fianchetto the bishop and possibly castle queenside.  It weakens the queenside pawns, but gives a strong bishop.  I wouldn't play it if I intended to castle to that side, especially since d2 is already open.",
        "8... O-O 9. Bb2 Bd7 10. O-O-O": "Castling on opposite sides often indicates attacks on both sides.  Whomever has the faster attack usually wins.",
        "10... a5": "Starting my attack against the exposed b pawn.",
        "11. Nb5": "Opening up the long diagonal to attack my centralized knight, possibly also attempting to trade the knight for my bishop targeting a4.",
        "11... a4 12. b4": "Refusing to trade, that was unexpected, but may force me to change my plans slightly if he can protect it with a3.",
        "12... c6": "Forcing the knight to retreat, so I can push the a pawn again.",
        "13. Na3": "Blocks my pawn, but weakens the knight by placing it on the edge of the board where it has less influence and mobility.",
        "13... d5": "Sacrificing my knight to remove the b pawn.",
        "14. Bxe5 Bxb4 15. Be2": "Protecting his knight.",
        "15... Qe7": "Attacking the bishop and adding pressure to the knight.",
        "16. c4": "Bb2 was expected, to help protect the knight and save the bishop.  Not sure what this was meant to do, but it strips away the king's remaining defender.",
        "16... Bxa3+": "Taking the free knight with check, though Qxe5 is probably better.",
        "17. Kd2 Bb4+": "Preventing the king from fleeing to the kingside.",
        "18. Bc3 dxe4": "Opening the center since I have a material advantage and foresee us trading several pieces in the next few moves.",
        "19. Rb1": "Threatening my bishop.",
        "19... Bxc3+ 20. Kxc3": "I expected Qxc3, but perhaps he hoped I'd hang my queen with exf.",
        "20... Qe5+ 21. Kd2 b5": "I didn't want to lose material, though this pawn didn't really play a role after this.",
        "22. f4": "Forcing my queen to move, perhaps hoping I'd abandon the defense of my b pawn.",
        "22... Qf5 23. g3": "Protecting the f pawn, but fatally weakening the white squares.",
        "23... Rfd8": "Taking the open d file, I should have played this earlier.",
        "24. Ke1 Ng4": "Attacking the queen, and looking at Qc5 followed by f5 to protect my passed pawn.",
        "25. Bxg4 Qxg4": "I didn't expect the trade, but give up defense of my e pawn and hope to win his queen.",
        "26. Qe2": "Offering a trade.",
        "26... e3": "I push the pawn, seeing Qxg4 Bxg4, which will blockade the king.",
        "27. Qf3 Qf5": "Attacking the rook and thinking about advancing my b pawn.",
        "28. Ne2": "Blunder, setting up my mating attack.",
        "28... Qxb1+ 29. Nc1": "Forced.",
        "29... Qxc1+": "30. Ke2 Qd2  31. Kf1 Bh3  32. Kg1 Qe1 33. Qf1 Qxf1#",
        "30. Qd1 Qc3+ 31. Kf1": "Ke2 leads to mate 1 move quicker.",
        "31... Bh3+ 32. Ke2 Bg4+ 33. Kf1 Rxd1+ 34. Kg2 Qd2#": "0-1"
