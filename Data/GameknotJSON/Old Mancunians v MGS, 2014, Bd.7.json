    "moves": {
        "1. c4": "There was some speculation about what opening I might try, given that I've traditionally been a 1.e4 player and haven't played 1.c4 over the board since 1983, but I've been playing this on GK for some time.",
        "1... Nf6 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O": "White can always play d2-d4 and transpose to a King's Indian, but if I wanted to play that, I'd play 1.d4.",
        "5. e4 d6 6. Nge2": "Keeping my options open, although I have a reasonable idea of what I'm going to do.",
        "6... c5 7. d3": "Even now 7.d4 is perfectly reasonable, but my opponent is sniffing, again, and he gives the impression that I'm some old fart who's going to manoeuvre around for 30 moves whilst he tries to hit me down the long diagonal.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Bg5": "Apparently, I'm supposed to play 0-0, h3, Be3 and work towards d3-d4, all of which begs the question 'Why not play d2-d4 in the first place?'",
        "8... Ne8": "?! Too slow surely.  The Nf6-e8-c7-e6-d4 is seen in some lines, but this is simply slow.  8. ... Rb8, ... a6, ... b5 is one way that Black is going to give himself play here, or he should be playing 8. ...h6, 9.Be3 Kh7 and trying to blockade.  ",
        "9. Qd2 Nc7 10. Bh6": "Nobody said that I had to be subtle.  Now 10. ... Bxh6, 11.Qxh6 followed by h2-h4-h5 is a standard Yugoslav style attack from the Sicilian Dragon, but without the open c-file to allow Black counter-play.",
        "10... Ne6": "Still very slow though.  It might be worth playing 10. ... e5 first to clamp down on the centre and try to force ... f5.",
        "11. O-O-O": "White shows his hand.  A straight-forward K-side attack against anything that Black has to offer. ",
        "11... a6 12. h4": "English purists are busy getting upset around now, but Black's play is just too slow.  White can always throw in e5, opening the h1-a8 diagonal, or f2-f4-f5.  Importantly, if Black can play b5, so what?  b5-b4 isn't going to help him, and bxc4, dxc4 won't achieve much either.  Suddenly, White has a free attack.",
        "12... Re8": "Too slow.  If anything, the rook belongs on the f-file, looking to play f5 or f6 and coming to f7. ",
        "13. h5 Bh8 14. f4": "Not disimilar to last year's game. ",
        "14... Ned4": "Black gets his knight to d4, but that's not where the action is at the moment. ",
        "15. hxg6 fxg6 16. f5": "White continues his brutal attack.  Is it sound?  The more important question is how do you defend against it at 30 moves in an hour. ",
        "16... Ne5 17. fxg6 hxg6": "Black's knights look pretty and give him some counter-play, but with the f-file and the h-file open, his centralised knights aren't helping. ",
        "18. Bf4": "White opens the h-file for the Rh1.  If, say, 18. ... Rb8, 19. Rxh8+ Kxh8, 20. Bxe5+ dxe5, 21. Qh6+ is terminal. 21. ...Kg8, 22. Qxg6+ Kf8, 23. Rf1+ does the job. ",
        "18... Ng4": "Black confessed after the game that he'd forgotten about Rxh8 after his initial calculations, but this gives some play.",
        "19. Bh3": "What's an exchange between friends?  19. ...Nf2, 20.Bxc8 Rxc8 and White can look at sacrificing on h8, or, perhaps, playing Rh6.  Black might be able to hold for a draw in some lines (White repeating Qg6-h6-g6 etc) but White's pieces are more usefully placed than Black's, and the Re8 is badly misplaced.",
        "19... Nf3": "Black carefully moves his knights from their centralised positions, but the move has the merit of getting the Queen away from the h6 square.",
        "20. Qc2": "There's nothing in sacrificing the queen.  20.Bxg4 Nxd2, 21.Bxc8 Rxc8, 22.Rxd2 and White doesn't have enough.",
        "20... e5": "?! After all that effort to preserve the Bh8, why block it off.  White gets d5 for his knight, Black loses e5 for his.",
        "21. Bxg4 Bxg4 22. Be3": "Black's bishop pair is almost as bad as his rook pair.  White's plan continues unrestrained.  Black is a little shorter on time than White, but nothing to worry about. ",
        "22... Nd4 23. Bxd4": "The knight has to die (Qd2 Nf3=) and I'm minded to give up the rook for Black's dark squared bishop in any event.",
        "23... cxd4": "There was some debate after the game was to whether Black should play exd4, but if he's to get counter play, it must surely come down the b- and c-files, and why give me Nf4?",
        "24. Nd5": "Not so long ago, Black's knights appeared to dominate the centre.  Now they're history and the Nd5 looks huge.",
        "24... Bg7 25. Qd2": "White stops Qg5+ and threatens to come in to h6 in due course.",
        "25... b5": "10 moves or so too late, Black attempts to open the Q-side, but the problems remain.  He's played ...b5.  So what?",
        "26. Rh4": "Doubling with tempo.",
        "26... Be6 27. Rdh1 Rc8": "Black's counter-play is too far behind.  c4 won't fall in time and White isn't interested in heading for an endgame.    Better might be 27. ...Ra7, defending the Bg7.",
        "28. Rh4h7": "With the time control in sight, White puts the boot in.  The bishop cannot be defended without losing an exchange (28 ...Qd7, 29.Nf6+).  28. ...g5 is potentially the saving move at this stage, preventing the queen coming into h6, although I like 29.Nxd4 exd4, 30.Qh2 where Black is still exposed. ",
        "28... Bxd5": "If White plays 29. exd5, Black has just enough time to defend, but a little zwischenzug from White nails it down. ",
        "29. Rxg7+": "! Now the attack breaks through.",
        "29... Kxg7 30. Qh6+ Kf7 31. Qh7+ Ke6 32. exd5+ Kf5": "Hoping for 33.Rf1+ Kg4, 34.Qxg6+ Qg5+ and Black escapes.",
        "33. g4+": "White continues with his mating net.  33. ...Kf6, 34. g5+ Kxg5 35.Qh4+ Kf5, 36.Nh3# is neat.  \nAfter 34. ...Kf5, 35.Qf7+ is probably quickest, although Ng3+ might be prettier.",
        "33... Kxg4 34. Qh3+": "White resigned.  35. ...Kg5, 36. Qh4 Kf5, 37.Ng3# is the same mate as above.",
        "34... Kg5 35. Qh4+": ""
