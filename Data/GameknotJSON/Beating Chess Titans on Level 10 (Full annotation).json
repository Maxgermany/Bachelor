    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "I always do this with white nowadays.\n",
        "1... d5": "Typical response.\n",
        "2. c4": "And this.\n",
        "2... c6": "Semi-slav. This was the moment I started thinking.. 'OK, now the computer is going to murder me'.\n",
        "3. Nc3": "Pretty standard development.\n",
        "3... e5": "Pretty surprising. Had to think now where to put my knight after dxe5 4...d4. I was initially planning for 5. Nb1, but I just felt that this was back sliding.  \n",
        "4. dxe5": "What else? I had seen that I will lose this pawn anyway so it was a case of thinking 'where is the best place for the knight after Qh5+ an Qxe5?' \n",
        "4... d4": "As forseen. \n",
        "5. Ne4": "I decided at this moment that if Qh5 i could go Nd2 and block the check. Then after Qxe5 I would play Ndf3 and fork queen and pawn.\n",
        "5... Qa5+": "But after the check Nd2 would be asking for a passive position. It (the computer) could develop further with Bb4 and tie me down.\n",
        "6. Bd2": "When playing the computer I always try to force the issue.\n",
        "6... Qxe5": "Equal on material again but the computer has gained two very good bishops. I had an small suspicion that something had already gone wrong.\n",
        "7. Ng3": "I felt this was forced. Defending it with Qc2 would be asking for trouble because of Blacks active bishops. (Bf5 for example)\n",
        "7... Qd6": "Stepping away from my tempo gaining Nf3. \n",
        "8. Qc2": "I didn't want black developing his bishops to excellent squares later so I thought this move was good. Also defends c4 and prepares 0-0-0 (my initial plan - from which I chickened out of completely).\n",
        "8... Nf6": "Defends some light squares in the middle of the board.\n",
        "9. Nf3": "I was happy with my knights at this point. They re controlling most of the centre. Still developing though.\n",
        "9... c5": "Quite a strong (and annoying) pawn wedge there. But I thought I would undermine this later with Rd1 and e3. In hindsight I should have gone 0-0-0 next but I was too concerned about having a safe king on the kingside. Almost a flaw, almost falling into a category of closed-mindedness.\n",
        "10. Ne4": "On this move I spent a long time. I thought about Nf5, Bxf5 and Qxf5 threatening Qc8+ but didn't think it led anywhere. I thought about 0-0-0 and chickened out. I think my decision in the position just came back to the strategy of forcing moves against the computer. I noticed c5 weakened the h1-a8 diagonal and I had hazy, distant plans of g3 and Bg2 and Bf4. At the time this seemed very active, it centralised my queen and gave me options on the kingside. \n",
        "10... Nxe4": "Moving the queen would lose a tempo so this is forced.\n",
        "11. Qxe4+": "Check! And now as I looked at this on the board I thought 'well great, now he gets a free developing move!' And this, I realised, was probably why Ne4 was premature and weak. I tried to look for positives and thought, 'OK, my queen is strong and he is weakened on his kingside now. I can play e3 and develop both bishops in one fell swoop'. Still I kind of fancied my chances in this position.\n",
        "11... Be7": "One free move for black. I did know about this before I played Ne4. But I thought that a loss of tempo for a strong initiative (my next move) and greater development (black is lagging) was an OK trade for this stage of the game.\n",
        "12. e3": "I think Rd1 was my other move here but I just wanted to get my bishop to d3 and warn (the computer) against castling kingside. I was also sick of seeing black pawns on d4 and c5. I think that this move was forced in a non-literal sense (follow my reasoning..?!) due to my recent loss of tempo.\n",
        "12... dxe3": "I must admit I didn't expect the computer to take here. Opening the d file for my rook, allowing pressure against c5. I did hope for this when I played e3 and now I felt that I can get a dominating position quite quickly. However, as often in chess you think 'Yes, this position is just great, he has no moves to play against me to challenge my immediate plans,' and out comes lightening from a clear blue sky!\n",
        "13. Bxe3": "Beautiful. Rd1 is coming. Bd3 is coming. 0-0 is coming.\n",
        "13... f5": "OUCH. At first I thought 'Wow, nice light squares...what a stupid computer. Why would anyone do this?' and then I started considering where to put my queen. Maybe black will castle queenside. Hmm not so clear what I should do anymore. Oh no, black has a fast f4, 0-0 and Bf5. Erm... 'Time to resign?'\n",
        "14. Qc2": "Of course I considered Qd5 but my strategy when playing the computer is to keep my queen on for as long as possible. (Another flaw related to chess-closed-mindedness?) If f4 next I was considering either Bd2-c3 or Bc1, b3 and Bb2. But of course f4 means black can go 0-0 and Bf5 very easily indeed, so I was quite concerned about f4. I thought better for black now. Shouldn't have chickened out of 0-0-0...\n",
        "14... O-O": "But thankfully this gives me some time and some targets. The d-file is offered to me now free of charge. The pawn on h7 also looks pretty weak. Now f5 was looking a slightly odd advancement to me. I really wanted to play Bd3 and 0-0!\n",
        "15. Rd1": "These queenside pawns become a worry a little later.\n",
        "15... Qa6": "This annoyed me for a long while. I don't want to play b3, because my queen will be forever tied down to defending a2. I thought about all kinds of ways to sacrifice this pawn but in the end my calculation skills are just not that good. So eventually I thought 'why not just a3, it defends itself and stops the imminent black threat of Nc6-b4'. I like multi-purpose moves.\n",
        "16. a3": "However, once played I could forsee some trouble against my weakend c4 pawn. So it seems I accepted control of the d-file (short term success) for a weakened queenside (long term problem). Hmm... maybe a3 could have been played sooner. Still not so happy with my position.\n",
        "16... Nc6": "I also had half an idea of Ne5 and f4, but black could play f4 himself (itself). This move calms things down in the centre anyway.\n",
        "17. Bd3": "Thanks to a3 there is no fork on b4. Getting somewhere now...\n",
        "17... Qa5+": "Whenever I see the computer check me and the squares on the screen light up red I immediately panic. Red means danger. What have I missed!? Then I swallowed hard and opened one eye. I was confused. 'Huh? I have a perfect excuse now to execute my goal of a bishop re-route to c3.' \n",
        "18. Bd2": "Black must be re-routing the queen to a more active position on c7 where it would control some central squares. Thankfully still no f4 threat.\n",
        "18... Qa6": "But no. What is this? I think this utterly pointless excursion lulled me into complacency. My next move is a clear oversight which blows the advantage I currently perceived myself having.\n",
        "19. Bc3": "I hate this move. First of all I considered 0-0 which would have been grand, why did I not just castle? But now once again I have given the computer a free developing move with the consequence  that I lost lots of time on my 20th move. I surprised myself with the amount of disgust I felt when reflecting on this decision after the computers next move.. because after all, this was my masterplan... was it not?\n",
        "19... Be6": "I have blocked defence of that weak c4 pawn. I got up and walked out after this move because I was poised with my hand over my king ready to castle immediately. Now what do I do?\n",
        "20. Ne5": "I really did not want to play b3 and weaken my queenside even further (I saw b3 Qxa3 Ra1). But b3 Rad8 is asking for a bad position. I really did not want to play Ne5, but I thought that his was my most active continuation. I admit I didn't give serious consideration to Qe2, it just looked potentially suicidal and a move that would lead to another free developing move for black eventually (any rook to e8).\n",
        "20... Bf6": "This I expected, and now I was committed to some forced trading.\n",
        "21. Nxc6": "In this position I liked the way the bishops are positioned in pairs and in direct confrontation with the opposing bishops.\n",
        "21... Bxc3+": "Stonger that allowing me to take on f6 I suspect.\n",
        "22. Qxc3": "Didn't even consider bxc3.\n",
        "22... Qxc6": "Ok. Only one move here.\n",
        "23. O-O": "I get to finally castle! I will now play Rfe1 and once again try to build an advantage. I stopped again here for a while trying to find a way onto the light squares around blacks king, but I just kept reaching the conclusion that the bishop on e6 was an extremely rigid defender, priceless to blacks position. I had long term goals of my queen sitting mighty on e5, bishop on d5, and rooks firing down the centre. I think it is excellent practice to always try to imagine your dream position and make plans towards it instead of just making moves in the position.\n",
        "23... b6": "At first this looks like a terrible mistake. Surely now I can get my bishop to its dream destination much quicker than anticipated?\n",
        "24. Be2": "Bf3 threatened, but now once again the computer throws a spanner in the works and I miss the key to winning by one move.\n",
        "24... Rfd8": "?! I admit I did not understand at first. Just allowing the fork? Chess titans level 10?\n",
        "25. Bf3": "Thank you very much!!\n",
        "25... Qa4": "AH. If I was to take the rook on a8 I expected curtains to close somewhere and to do so very soon. My c4 pawn is once again under pressure. It seems I have been outsmarted, and my first instinct was to just play Rc1. But looking at this position now the winning move is obvious to me. Can you see it? I didn't until one move too late.\n",
        "26. Rxd8+": "Throwing away a win. My worst move (bar blunders) for a significant amount of time. I am going to be a liar and blame it on time pressure.. It was time pressure that forced my hand. \n",
        "26... Rxd8": "The problem now is my extremely weak pawn. If I play Rc1 there is Rd4 and I am going very passive. And now I saw it; the winning move missed on move 26, and I kicked myself. I even thought my instinct of Rc1 would have been OK.\n",
        "27. b3": "This was the winning move, a simple interference. I thought this was very active in this position due to Qxa3 Ra1 Qb4 Qe3 (hitting the bishop AND still defending b3) Bf7 and Rxa7. In fact at the time I thought this my only move to stay in the game. My bishop on f3 is preventing a back rank embarrassment on d1 if my rook decided to flaunt itself on the 7th rank. In this ending, my king will definitely need some air...\n",
        "27... Qd7": "The computer decided not to enter those lines. Now I could see a nice way to get my long term dream position. If I could play Rd1 without being mated, and then take on d8, I could play Qe5 and Bd5 and be happy.\n",
        "28. h3": "This prepares Rd1 and stops any potentially annoying nonsense with f5 and Bg4.\n",
        "28... Qe7": "Sidestepping the planned route of attack. When playing 28. h3 I was slightly worried about losing possession if black went 28...Qd4. But now after Qe7 I started to see some tactics of my own starting with a nice pin.\n",
        "29. Re1": "Threatening Bd5, after which I would win immediately due to the party of pins. I didn't expect the computer to overlook this threat.\n",
        "29... Qd7": "I thought about forcing my plan now with Rd1 but that would not be taking advantage of the extra tempo I have gained. I think if it (the computer) had played Qd6 instead I would have gone with Rd1 for sure, but now my queen can jump into an undefended hole and generate some threats. It reminded me of those hidden Japanese gunmen on Iwo Jima. I was getting excited now, and I could feel my position getting more and more active.\n",
        "30. Qe5": "If it defends this bishop with Re8 then I go Bd5 again, and the black bishop is pinned both diagonally and laterally. If it moves the bishop to f7 my plan at this stage was Rd1 and I thought I could win the f5 pawn. \n",
        "30... Kf7": "So this was an only move. Now, for the third time in the game, I took a break. I was pleased that I had got the black king to weaken itself and I spent a relatively long time thinking how to exploit it. I thought that what I did next was a nice try for a win.\n",
        "31. Rd1": "I did this because I thought that I could get, at worst, a very active position vs. a very passive position, or at best a completely winning endgame. It turned out that the computer went for the 'completely winning endgame'! (It knew something I didn't).\n",
        "31... Qe7": "I guess queen for rook and bishop wouldn't be desirable for black in the approaching endgame. I thought that if this occurred I would be just winning due to my queen checks on c7.\n",
        "32. Rxd8": "I was committed now. But even at this point I didn't know how (or if) I could exploit blacks position. I thought that my queen was perfectly placed on e5 and that alone should mean some kind of advantage.\n",
        "32... Qxd8": "I wanted to avoid the queen vs queen endgame at all costs. My strategy of keeping my queen on the board does not extend to these type of positions.\n",
        "33. Bd5": "I thought that this was getting a little too complicated for me now. I wanted black to take the bishop off because Qxf5 apparently wins a pawn, but I just could not calculate or assess the position after black played Qf6. For two reasons.  1. The line ...Bxd5, Qxf5 Qf6, Qxf6 Kxf6, exd5. <--- This pawn is falling and I have a lost endgame. 2. If I DON'T take off the black queen he has (from f6) Qa1+ and Qxa3, which annoyingly defends a7. I saw nothing more than a draw here by perpetual.  So the only way for me to achieve my 'winning endgame' (I actually think I blundered severely later and was lucky that the computer didn't play the winning move) was to aim for a big pawn centre.\n",
        "33... Qf6": "As expected. I thought that if the computer played Bxd5 then it must have a solid continuation. If not, then I knew it had foreseen a white move that I had not which would refute it. Such is the dependence on luck when playing a computer!\n",
        "34. f4": "Trying to cement my bishop on d5 and hoping to achieve a passed pawn. It feels like I have built a solid wall right across the valley. But just like Helm's Deep, there is an exploitable weakness.\n",
        "34... Qxe5": "And now I have my passed pawn. Something to work with in the ending.\n",
        "35. fxe5": "Now it cannot possibly think about taking off my bishop, simply giving me two huge connected passed pawns. My plan here was very long winded and more abstract thought than hardcore calculation. Primarily concerned with pawn breaks such as b4, and c5 if allowed, and king over to the queenside to help force the issue, I paid little heed to blacks own pawn breaks. But I trusted my strong bind on the kingside with pawns on g2 and h3. Overall I wasn't overly optimistic about getting a win but I was happy that I wouldn't lose. Or shouldn't.\n",
        "35... f4": "I expected Kg6, so I was planning Kf2 for this. Only after f4 did I realise that Kg6 just left the bishop en pris. But I did spot the potential danger of facing a majority of pawns on the kingside here. I was very pleased that his (its, sorry) bishop was pinned or else it could help attack weaknesses on my kingside while pawns were pushed. This was duly noted, and I ordered my king to f3.\n",
        "36. Kf2": "The start of a long journey, Short style.\n",
        "36... Bxd5": "? I thought that this cannot be good. A highly counter-intuitive capture. But I looked, and I slowly began to realise that maybe the computer has found my wall's weakness.\n",
        "37. cxd5": "Still, beautiful central connected passed pawns. Get my king to e4 and march. The glass is half full. The glass is half full.\n",
        "37... g5": "Probably so the computer can play the following devious move without having to defend f4 after I go Kf3. This is a very sneaky preparatory move. And I think I missed the idea just as much as the computer did! I think this is a perfect example of how humans think differently than machines. We see plans based on what has come before. Computers dont have plans, they just crunch numbers and bang out the best move, objectively speaking, every time.\n",
        "38. Kf3": "I think this move, or more generally this idea, should have lost me the game. It is still hard to see why, but I suspect that my king cannot venture too far up the board due to the huge potential for black on the queenside. If I had had one hour in this position I would have most probably played 38. a4.\n",
        "38... b5": "!! In my opinion the best move of the game, and one which I just cannot calculate. The threat is ...c4, and I just didn't see whether I can continue to meander my king through light squares to support my own pawn promotion, or if I should be on guard duty for the rest of the game. It is one of those things. Black never HAS to play c4, without it my king cannot get to d4 and help in dissolving the threat. It is simply a very dangerous reserve waiting on the sideline. And if my king runs too far then the black pawns will be too quick to catch.  In truth, I had no idea what to do here. And at such a critical juncture I had only seconds left. For 2 more moves. In short, I decided to go for it. And I do believe that 40. Kf5 is losing to 40...c4. Who else thinks these pawn endings are the hardest part of chess?\n",
        "39. Ke4": "Three squares to go for each of my new central pawns, one king to block. One thing I knew for certain was that the black kingside pawns were going nowhere. I also anticipated that the computer would wait. Wait for me to commit to Kf5, and then push c4. Waiting for me to put my head in the lions mouth. I think in these situations ignorance definitely is bliss.\n",
        "39... h6": "I thought a better 'waiting move' would have been 39...a5. But still lying low in the long grass. Sneaky machine. \n",
        "40. Kf5": "I reach move 40 with about 3 seconds. I had told myself here 'If I lose to 40...c4, then I am happy that I at least understood something about this endgame.' And of course, the computer was up about 50 minutes at this stage. That made me laugh.\n",
        "40... a5": "? I now allowed myself another 30 minutes. And it seems that this move is a case of awful timing from the computer. Why not play this on the last move and threaten a4? Why wait now to play c4? At a greater depth I suspect c4 would be played. Its such a pressing issue. I actually felt a tinge of anti-climatic disappointment that I wasn't utterly blown away in this endgame. This pathetic move actually hands me victory. And an easy one thankfully!\n",
        "41. e6+": "41. e6 or d6? Like I said, always force the computer. If Ke7 next then Ke5 and d6. \n",
        "41... Kg7": "Run away!\n",
        "42. d6": "Any decent player would resign here, but not this computer. No, it must be mated. And it still takes the same amount of time to do it.\n",
        "42... Kf8": "The computer is being a bit annoying actually. Now if d7 Ke7.\n",
        "43. Kf6": "'I have beaten Chess Titans on its hardest difficulty setting!' I thought taking a celebratory swig of beer. Warm. Must have spent too long contemplating that endgame.  Not the best chess computer in the world, but nonetheless a worthy foe for my level.\n",
        "43... Ke8": "Like I said, it just wont give up until it has no more moves.\n",
        "44. d7+": "The time approaches.\n",
        "44... Kf8": "I was pleased the computer didn't play Kd8, prolonging the inevitable.\n",
        "45. d8=R#": "1-0 And why not finish with an underpromotion? Not really an underpromotion though. It was a tough game, where my opinion of the position went through polar switches as frequently as a pendulum swings. I thought that black may have been able to clinch a win at the end after I decided to 'go for it' with my king. I was pleased that I didn't blunder or give away any huge positional advantages, and I played solidly throughout, although I am disappointed that I missed the clear cut win with that simple interference move 26. b3. Live and learn. Comments welcome :)\n"
