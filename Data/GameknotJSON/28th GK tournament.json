    "moves": {
        "1. d4 d5 2. Bf4": "An invitation to the London System. You don\u00b4t see it much in high-level chess, but GM Miles played it many times. It is solid, the burden of theory is not too overwhelming, and it has quite a bit of venom if Black plays in a careless manner.",
        "2... Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Nd2 Nc6": "My opponent takes the \"Chigorin-approach\" to the opening. It doesn\u00b4t really challenge the White centre, but it is quite solid.",
        "5. Ngf3 Bd6 6. Bg5": "White has wasted a tempo by playing Bf4 and now Bg5, but the position is rather closed, and exchanging Bishops on d6 only helps Blacks development. An alternative could be 6. Bg3. After 6. - Bxg3 7. hxg3 White has a nice half-open file for the Rook, but there is not much advantage in that as long as Black hasn\u00b4t castled short.",
        "6... Bd7 7. c4": "This is not the standard pawn move in the London System, but since Black didn\u00b4t choose to challenge the centre with a move like c7-c5, I think this is the most active continuation for White.",
        "7... dxc4 8. Bxc4 h6 9. Bh4 a6": "Black could also try to go \"all in\" with a move like 9. - g5!? The strategy then would be exchange of dark-squared Bishops on g3 and 0-0-0, leading to a complicated middle-game.",
        "10. O-O O-O 11. a3": "Keeping the c6-Knight away from b4. I think the next move is a waste of time.",
        "11... Na5": "(?!)",
        "12. Bd3 Be7 13. Rc1 Nc6 14. Bb1": "Maybe my memory deludes me, but I think this maneouvre (Ra1-c1 and Bd3-b1) was something Bobby Fischer was fond of. The Bishop is safely tucked away, and it is a constant threat to to square h7. Perhaps that kind of simple strategy works better in blitz though ...",
        "14... Nd5": "My opponent decides to get rid of the \"London-Bishop\". Probably a good choice. His position is solid enough, but there are some potential weaknesses in the horizon: Square c7 and the beautiful Knight on d5 which can be chased away with a e3-e4 thrust.",
        "15. Bxe7 Qxe7 16. Re1 Rac8": "(?) Wrong Rook! I think 16. - Rfc8 followed by 17. - Rab8 would have sealed the Q-side pretty well.",
        "17. Ne4 Rcb8 18. Nc5": "In a few moves White has grabbed the initiative. Now the central Pawns start moving, and the Knights start dancing ...",
        "18... Nf6 19. e4 Rfd8 20. Qc2": "Threating 21. e5 and 22. Qh7 .",
        "20... e5 21. d5 Na7": "Now one of Blacks Knights are out of play, and White wins the important e5-Pawn.",
        "22. Nd3 c6 23. Nfxe5 a5 24. Nc4": "The Pawn on e4 has re-gained it\u00b4s mobillity, and the threat on h7 persists.",
        "24... b6 25. d6 Qe8 26. Nf4 Nh7": "GM Bent Larsen once commented that with a Knight on f8, you can\u00b4t get mated! I guess that is where this Knight is heading for, but Whites central Pawns are travelling too fast.",
        "27. Nd5": "(!) The Knight on d5 can\u00b4t be taken, since it will cost the Black Queen for Rook and Knight. Whites attack is too strong for this kind of exchanges.",
        "27... Nc8 28. e5 g6 29. Nc7 Qf8 30. e6 Qg7 31. e7": "The d- and e-Pawns have almost reached the \"goal-line\" with the help of the Knight-pair. The game is over, but Black fought on for some more moves. And why not? Errors could still be made!",
        "31... Nxe7 32. dxe7 Rdc8 33. Na6 Nf6 34. Nxb8 Rxb8 35. Rcd1 Nd5 36. Rxd5 cxd5 37. Nd6 Be8 38. Qc7 Ra8 39. Qb7": "39. Qd8 is an alternative, but almost everything wins.",
        "39... Kh7 40. Qxa8": "And Black resigned."
