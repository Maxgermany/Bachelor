        "1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 d6": "Fisher defense. I think alot of people play this move because it is the 'Fisher' move. Black seems to struggle alot in a lot of lines so has to tread very carefully.",
        "4. d4 g5 5. h4 g4 6. Ng1": "As I said earlier could take Ng5 but its very unsound. \r\n\r\nThis is the book position which is very strange considering after 6 moves we have a load of passed pawns and no minor or major pieces developed.",
        "6... Nf6": "Black attacks e4. Prob hoping to buy time and defend the f pawn on h5.",
        "7. Bxf4": "Takes the pawn exchange although could be viewed as a mistake since whites pawn was central and black would have had to waste valuable time & effort defending f pawn. ",
        "7... Nxe4": "No choice. ",
        "8. Bd3": "Better than Nc3",
        "8... Qe7 9. Ne2": "Stopping revealed check & losing Queen.",
        "9... Bg7 10. O-O O-O 11. Bxe4": "White has a lead in development with the open file.",
        "11... Qxe4 12. Nbc3 Qc6 13. Qd2 d5": "To stop Bh6",
        "14. Ng3 Qf6": "Black is restricted here. Unable to develop his pieces he looks to pick up a pawn to make himself feel better!",
        "15. Be5 Qxh4": "Gets his free pawn!",
        "16. Bxg7": "Exposes King. Blacks only developed piece here is his Queen.",
        "16... Kxg7 17. Nxd5 f5": "Knight on g3 is safe as would lead to mate in 3 if Queen takes.",
        "18. Qf4 Nc6 19. Nxc7 Rb8 20. Rae1": "White is loaded up. Had better development and control of the open and semi open file. Smart play should lead to a victory from here.",
        "20... Kg8 21. d5 Ne7 22. Nh5": "! Black has to take exchange. If he doesnt 23.Qh3 which at best would result in lost Queen.",
        "22... Qxh5 23. Rxe7 b5": "Making room to get rook into help out the defense.",
        "24. Rfe1": "WHites rooks are now conected on an open file. Black is in serious danger.",
        "24... Rb6 25. d6": "Blocks the rooks involvement and the prospect of promotion could become a real thorn in blacks side. ",
        "25... Qh4 26. g3 Qf6": "A nice little finishing combo for yall.",
        "27. Ne8 Qxb2 28. Qg5+ Kh8 29. Rxh7+": "Rook sac   :) ",
        "29... Kxh7 30. Re7+ Kh8 31. Qh5+ Kg8 32. Qh7#": "Thats all folks!"
