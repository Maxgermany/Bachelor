O-O": "(easy19) Looking at this position the plan must be simple\r\nConcidering i wil do the 0-0 in the next few moves\r\nAnd most of your pieces already directed onto mij kings wing. it is good to concentrate on the e4 e5 and f4 f5 squares with as ultimate goal launching an attack on my kings wing.",
