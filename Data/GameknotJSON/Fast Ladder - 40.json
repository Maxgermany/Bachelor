        "5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. Nc3 O-O 9. Bf4 c6": "Identified by the computer as an inaccuracy.  It prefers \"\u2026 Nc6 9.  Be3  Bf6  10. e5 Be7  11. Qb3 Qd7  12. Rac1 Bf5  13.

Black's pawn structure is typical of the Slav defence, which is very sound, so I think Sheridan can be forgiven this :-) ",
        "10. h3 Bh5 11. g4": "Now the computer gives me a whole pawn advantage!... but it doesn't last long :-(  This is the start of a sustained attack on Black's kingside which, I feel, should have been more successful than it ultimately was, whether due to Sheridan's defensive skills or my attacking errors remains to be seen.",
        "11... Bg6 12. Qd2": "Curiously, my advantage drops to +0.49 with this move, though the computer suggests no alternative.",
        "12... Nb8d7": "Black continues to try to catch up on development.",
        "13. Rad1": "It would be standard policy to park this R on c1, controlling the half-open file but it bites on granite at c6.  On d1, the R supports a potential later central thrust and opposes Black's Q.",
        "13... Bb4": "Now Black starts to try to undermine White's impressive looking centre by pinning the QN against White's Q and thus threatening to capture the e4 pawn.  I had to think quite hard about how to deal with this threat, eventually opting to bolster e4 with my LSB.",
        "14. Bd3": "Now my \"advantage\" drops to +0.24, so presumably the computer doesn't like this, though does not suggest a better move.",
        "14... Nf6": "Black renews the threat to e4 and establishes even tighter control over d5.  If White is tempted to play e5, Black will have a lovely outpost for the rest of the game.  Nevertheless, the computer doubles White's advantage again!",
        "15. Qe2": "Now the e4 pawn is over-protected and the N is no longer pinned.  Blacks DSB is looking superfluous, so...",
        "15... Bxc3": "Black swaps.  The computer doesn't like this, again doubling White's advantage to +0.98, but in this sort of position, Black's Ns are likely to more than match White's Bs.",
        "16. bxc3": "Now White has a typical Grunfeld pawn structure but Black still has two Ns.",
        "16... Qe7": "Black gets his Q off the d-file, allowing a R to occupy d8 and apply further pressure to White's centre.",
        "17. Rfe1": "Again, White opposes the enemy Q with a R.  White's development is now complete and it is time to develop a plan.",
        "17... h6": "Black creates a hole for his K (or B if it is attacked) but also provides a target for White.",
        "18. Ne5": "White's N seizes a key central square from which to dominate Black's position.  I was in two minds whether to follow this up with Nxg6 if Black allowed.  I generally like to swap Ns for Bs but in this position White's N looks much stronger than Black's B, so it would be an odd swap unless there were some concrete tactical advantage to be gained.",
        "18... Bh7": "Black retreats anyway, so I don't need to choose.",
        "19. g5": "This is a double edged move: if Black swaps pawns I get a nice pin on his Nf6 and can follow up with a full-scale kingside attack with minor and major pieces.  On the other hand, White's king is looking exposed, so, if the attack fails, Black will probably mate White quickly (but such possibilities are a long way down the line at this stage).",
        "19... hxg5 20. Bxg5": "I was quite pleased with this position, though unsure how to proceed.  The computer has dropped bmy advantage by 0.1 to +0.90 now.",

        "21. Qh5": "!??  I had my heart in my mouth as I played this picturesque move, apparently putting the Q en prise but exploiting the pin on the Nf6 against the Qe7.  It's the kind of move that would cause a lesser opponent to panic but Sheridan reacted calmly.  Of course the prosaic computer sees none of the beauty in my concept and has Black launching a Queenside frolic with his own Q:\n\nBlunder: +0.62 \u00bb 21.  Qh5  Nbd7  22. Qf3 Qa3  23. Bb1 Qb2  24.

        "22. Nxd7": "Played with the objective of maintaining the pressure on the h4-d8 diagonal by removing one of the Nf6's defenders.  The computer, of course, identifies this as another mistake, though now its preferred move is 22. Qh4 rather than 22. Qf3 as in the earlier note.",
        "22... Qxd7": "Black recaptures with the Q, thus releasing the pin for a lesser pin.  The computer prefers the Rook capture followed by ...e5.

Perhaps it's a question of putting it somewhere safe where White won't bother to molest it.  If he'd just played it to g6, I'd have harassed it with the h-pawn.  If he'd played it to g4, we might have settled for a draw by repetition if I'd gone 36. Rg7 Bh5 37. Rg5 etc",
