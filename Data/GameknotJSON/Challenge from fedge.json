        "2. c4": "Queen's gambit. I love this opening, for if he accepts the gambit by playing dxe4, I'll reply with e5, immediately opting for control of the center squares and attacking his c-file isolated pawn.",
        "2... Be6": "Then he plays a strange move. Mistake by my calculation. This move is also not in the GK database. This move protects the d-pawn but it impairs development. The e-file pawn cannot advance and the dark square bishop (DSB) is blocked in.\n\ne6 would be better do decline the gambit.",
        "3. Nc3": "Developing the queen's side pieces, re-enforcing my control of the center while attacking d5.",
        "3... c6": "Protecting the d-pawn.\n\nAnother mistake, as this reduces developing options for the knight on b8.",
        "4. Nf3": "Developing."
