        "1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5": "Ah, the King's Gambit.  And in this line white develops while black futzes around with his pawns, making kingside weaknesses.\n",
        "4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O": "This is why I posted this.  It just tickles me pink.  A pawn for a knight.  A second pawn is coming, but this just went from a gambit to a GAMBIT. \n",
        "5... gxf3 6. Qxf3 Qe7 7. d4": "Because it's the bishop that's meant to re-capture the advanced f pawn, naturally. \n",
        "7... Nc6 8. c3 Ne5": "An interesting idea.  Black offers the choice of regaining the material with the cost of both a pawn and the sweet center structure while gaining an isolani OR losing the powerful white-square bishop. \n",
        "9. Qe2 Nxc4": "And Zukertort chooses strong pawns. \n",
        "10. Qxc4 c6 11. Bxf4 Qxe4": "While I can understand wanting to do some damage to white's center, this is emphatically NOT the piece to do it with at this time. \n",
        "12. Bg3": "Secures the bishop, freeing the rook, threatening the pin... Oh, and threatens Qxb7.  Still, better is Nd2. \n",
        "12... Qd5": "And a multi-purpose attacking move deserves a multi-purpose defensive move.",
        "13. Re1+": "Wow.  I bet you didn't see that one coming. \n",
        "13... Ne7 14. Qe2 Kd8": "Trying to run away?  But how's that gonna happen without d6?  So why not d6 now? \n",
        "15. Bh4 Qd6": "What else is there?  Not much. \n",
        "16. Na3": "A knight on the rim... is about to open up a can of woop-a$$.",
        "16... b5 17. Rad1": "Ok, let's take stock.  White has four thousand pieces pointed at e7.  They're mostly coordinating well.  He has two pawn islands and he's down a whole piece.  Black has a piece and an awkward position.  All the force on e7 guarantees that the king can't be extracted without losing that piece.  Not fun for Black. \n",
        "17... Bb7 18. Rd3 f6": "Black's trying to do what he can to get breathing room and to develop the rest of his pieces.  One can't fault him for trying -- but Zukertort has it all covered.",
        "19. Rf3 Bg7": "...removing one of the defenders of e7, but there's one less attacker.  However, that blocked attacker can do more elsewhere. \n",
        "20. Bg3 Qe6 21. Re3": "Ugh. \n",
        "21... Qf7 22. Rxe7 Qg6 23. Nxb5": "Saccing the knight to get the Queen into a position from which she can mate. \n",
        "23... Ba6": "And Black wants none of that.",
        "24. Rxd7+": "But there are just too many ways for black to die.  The g3 bishop holds c7 and that makes the rook sac possible -- king gets mated on c8. \n"
