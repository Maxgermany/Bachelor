        "1. e4 c5 2. Bc4": "2.Nf3,Nc3,c3,are the most popular moves in the Sicilian variation  (  if 2.Nf3 it can be dragon , nijdorff, classical,. if 2.Nc3 it is closed Sicilian ., and 2. c3 this called Alapin variation ",
        "2... Nc6 3. Qf3": "bad move , moving the Queen in the start of the game its  a big mistake , the move 3.Qf3? threats mate on f7 can be easily avoid by the moves 3....e6!,Nf6!,Ne5 all so good option its  attacking the queen on f3 and the bishop on c4 and defending f7 in the same time , moving the queen in the start is  very bad because of blacks development will be much better by the moves 3...Nf6.4.Nc3-d6 ..... there is another problem for white , the queen now blocking the knight on g1 forcing it moving on passive position (e2,h3) and moving the queen back is start of wasting time (tempo)",
        "3... Nf6 4. b3 Ne5 5. Qf4 Nxc4 6. bxc4 d6 7. Nh3": "its not so good spot for the knight , 7.Nf3-g6.8.Bb2-Bg7.9.Nc3 -0-0.10.0-0-Bd7  and blacks position is better but at least white finished its development , ",
        "7... g6 8. Bb2 Bg7 9. Qf3": "9.Nc3 was much better , white is wasting to much time moving its queen , white must develop its Pisces soon as possible .",
        "9... O-O 10. Ng5 Bg4": "good move , black finished its development , moving the bishop to g4 , attacking the queen on f3, making big advantage for black . all so its not good idea moving twice With  the same piece  Nh3,Ng5 .",
        "11. Qg3": "sirius blunder for white , now black wins matirial in avery nice way , 11....Nh5!!.12.Qxg4-Bxb2! and the white rook is traped . 11.Qb3 was the best move i think .",
        "11... Nh5 12. Qxg4 Bxb2 13. Qh4 Bxa1 14. g4 Nf6 15. Qh6 Qd7 16. h4 Qxg4 17. h5 gxh5 18. f3 Qg3+ 19. Kf1 Bd4": "now its over , 19...Bd4!  completely finished whits last chants ,by  treating mate followed Qf2 # black defending the pawn on h5 , controlling g1 making the whits king life to the end very quick.",
        "20. Nh3 Qxf3+ 21. Ke1 Qxh1+ 22. Ke2 Qxh3": "simply a muskier",
        "23. c3 Qg2+ 24. Kd1 Be5 25. Na3 Qf3+": "the white queen is traped ",

Ka4 Qb4#": "it is very important to develop Pisces , not moving the queen to soon , controlling the center , safety for the kings , all the whits problem started by moving its queen to soon and by those moves wasted huge wast of time and followed those mistakes started loosing heavy material and the game , i am not showing this game to make fun of my opponent , i am showing that for learning and i think it is good lesson for beginners , use these elements , i hope you enjoyed my game and i will love to read your comments , thank you  and have a nice day !!"
