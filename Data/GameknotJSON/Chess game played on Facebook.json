    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "This is a really exciting game, with sides castling on opposite sides, and both throwing everything at the opposition king. I think with hindsight, I was far too optimistic, because of the success this opening variation had achieved in the past, and my opponent, who combines beauty with brains, found good defensive moves and then good attacking moves when the initiative had passed to her. Enjoy dear reader!",
        "1... g6": "First, a note on my opponent. I have played her 23 times on Gameknot, over the last two years. For some reason she has lost access to her Gameknot account, so we played on Facebook, by sending each other messages of what move we wanted to play.",
        "2. d4": "So I set up the usual d4-e4 pawn centre against her Modern Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Defense",
        "2... Bg7": "She completes the fianchetto.",
        "3. Nc3": "I rule out any transposition to the King's Indian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence",
        "3... d6": "This is normally played.",
        "4. Be3": "I develop.",
        "4... Nf6": "She attacks e4 and also threatens Nf6-g4.",
        "5. f3": "I rule that out, and I now have a pawn structure similar to the King's Indian Defence, S\u00e4misch Variation, except my c pawn is on c2 rather than c4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation\nFor this reason, it is called the Pseudo-Samisch centre by some authorities.",
        "5... O-O": "Has this lady no fear? This is rather castling into the strong white attack. 5....c6 is more popular, and scores better from black on the opening databases, compared to 5...0-0 ",
        "6. Qd2": "So I prepare 0-0-0 and launching a king-side attack.",
        "6... c6": "She prepares Queen-side counter play.",
        "7. O-O-O": "Off my king goes.",
        "7... Qa5": "And out her queen comes.",
        "8. Bh6": "While I immediately set about exchanging one her strongest pieces - the bishop on g7, as part of an attack on her king.",
        "8... b5": "And her attack comes too.",
        "9. h4": "Charge!",
        "9... b4": "She attacks my knight.",
        "10. Nb1": "Knight drops back.",
        "10... Nbd7": "She quietly develops rather than picking up my a pawn.",
        "11. h5": "Charge again!",
        "11... Nxh5": "She takes. Note how the black queen helps defend along the 5th rank.",
        "12. Bxg7": "At this point she asked for help. I told her how in the Gameknot World Opening database there were two games with this position, both of which black took back with the king and white won.",
        "12... Nxg7": "So she took back with the knight, just to be different. It was the only time in the game she asked for help.",
        "13. Qh6": "This seemed the natural attacking move. After the game, I found out that Fritz also likes g4, but eventually settles on Qh6 and assesses the position as slightly better for black. I was feeling very confident, and thought that black would be lucky to survive the attack.",
        "13... Nf6": "The knight comes over to protect h7. Clearly this is the best move.",
        "14. Bc4": "I thought this was best, attacking and developing and also protecting a2. Fritz prefer g4 and still gives black the edge.",
        "14... d5": "Fritz at first prefers Be6 or Rd8, but after a while also looks at d5",
        "15. e5": "I thought this was just winning. I missed her next move. Fritz likes Bb3 instead, with advantage to white.",
        "15... Nf5": "Fritz now puts black 1 pawn up",
        "16. Qh2": "I wanted to keep the pressure on the h file.",
        "16... dxc4": "Fritz prefers Nh5 and thinks that this move hands the advantage back to white.",
        "17. exf6": "Naturally I take, renewing the threat to take on h7 with mate.",
        "17... h5": "This is the best defence.",
        "18. g4": "I attack again.",
        "18... Qxa2": "She calmly just takes the a pawn. Fritz prefers exf6. Now - should I take knight or pawn?",
        "19. gxh5": "This is another mistake. I should have either taken the knight or played f6xe7. This hands the advantage back to her, Fritz put it at more than plus 1 to black.",
        "19... g5": "We both thought this was forced as otherwise white is mating black down the h file. Fritz however points out the benefits of 19....c3! and black has her own mating threats. ",
        "20. fxe7": "The game is more or less level again.",
        "20... Nxe7": "She takes back. Fritz also likes 20....Re8 here.",
        "21. Qe5": "Fritz also considers 21. h6 and 21. Qd2 forking the pawns on g5 and b4.",
        "21... Nd5": "This is strong, the knight takes up a powerful central position. However Fritz likes the immediate c3.",
        "22. Qxg5+": "So I get my pawn back.",
        "22... Kh7": "Clearly the best square, avoiding checks on the long dark diagonal.\n",
        "23. Ne2": "Developing my knight at last. Fritz agrees that this is the best move for white. I was starting to think black had an advantage her. Fritz thinks so too, about plus 0.5 to black.",
        "23... Rg8": "She attacks my queen. Again Fritz points out that c3 could have been played at once.",
        "24. Qe5": "My queen takes up a central position, but without much support, she is unable to achieve much.",
        "24... Bd7": "At last the bishop is developed.",
        "25. Rdg1": "I contest the open g file. Fritz doesn't think much of that move and looks at Qe4+, Rh2 and h6. Black's advantage put at plus 3.59, after what it considers the best move, h6.",
        "25... c3": "Fritz considers this best.",
        "26. bxc3": "I take.",
        "26... Rae8": "A sound move attacking my Queen.",
        "27. Qh2": "This seemed to me to be the logical move, although I feared I was about to be overwhelmed on the Queen-side. Fritz thinks that white should give up the queen instead with 27. Rxg8. The reality of the position is that white is lost now, and I chose to play this and live in hope that she would not spot the winning technique on the Queen-side. Certainly giving up the queen is almost equivalent to resignation.",
        "27... Bf5": "There are many ways to win now. This is one of them. The mate threat is 28....Qxc2",
        "28. Ng3": "Virtually the only way to stop the mate threat. The other move 28. Nf4 is met with 28....Nxf4 and I can't take back with my queen, as I get mated on c2.",
        "28... bxc3": "She takes, with some nasty threats on the Queen-side. Fritz agrees that this is best.",
        "29. Nxc3": "Probably best out of some dreadful options.",
        "29... Qa1+": "Interesting way to finish off.",
        "30. Nb1": "I play this rather than letting my knight go with check.",
        "30... Reb8": "It is mate in 5 now.",
        "31. Nxf5": "Kd2 holds out slightly longer, but I decided to take the bishop. OK dear reader, although I played on two more moves, (but not quite to mate) I will leave the annotation here, and leave you to find the forced mate in three. Do not spoil it for others - send me a private message with the answer. Many thanks for reading, please rate it on the star system, and leave a message or two to let me know how I am doing with my annotations. Until next time dear reader!"
