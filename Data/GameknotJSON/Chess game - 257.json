        "1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4 Nf6 4. e3 e6": "Black voluntarily bllocks in his light squared bishop which is a tame way to handle the opening esp considering C7-C5 is not available to open the position.",
        "5. Bd3": "Directing the bishop Kingsside for an attack, plenty of options open to white here.",
        "5... Bd7 6. c3": "A usual White relies on solid pawn structure as a basis to go forward from in the middlegame",
        "6... Be7": "White as just followed the normal development and already has an edge as blacks pieces are somewhat confined.\r\n\r\n",
        "7. h3 O-O 8. Nbd2": "Black has no quick options of freeing the pawn advance without C7-C5 or even E7-E5 the prospects are limited",
        "8... Nh5": "?! A pointless move as white already has made room to retreat with H3",
        "9. Bh2 Nf6 10. O-O Bd6 11. Ne5": "Knight is well placed & limits blacks chances of freeing pieces.",
        "11... Be8 12. Rc1 a6 13. Bb1": "idea to play Qc2 and weaken blacks kingside by Ng4 trading and riding defender.",
        "13... Nd7 14. f4": "if 14.Qc2 then F5 blocks attack",
        "14... f6 15. Nxd7 Bxd7 16. e4 Re8": "? A wait and see move, F5 would have slowed whites advance.",
        "17. e5 Be7 18. exf6 Bxf6 19. Nf3 Re7 20. Qe1": "White prepares to move Queen to Kingside",
        "20... Qf8 21. Ne5 Nxe5": "? in a difficult position black blunders away a piece",
        "22. fxe5": "Black resigns, with no great attacking options and a piece down.\r\n\r\nNotice the space White has Kings side to launch an attack and how Black has struggled throughout the game to make any room at all. \r\n\r\nIt makes sense to activate Queens bishop before its locked in behind a row of pawns.\r\n\r\nA steady game by White who pushed forward and let black be the master of his own demise"
