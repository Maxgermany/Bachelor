        "1. d4": "Victory snatched from the jaws of defeat! this game shows why sometimes it pays not to resign even when in a bad situation.",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 h6": "i think this opponent has done some homework and spotted that I've been playing the Torre attack a lot recently. h6 prevents my usual 3.Bg5",
        "3. e3": "...so I'll try something different this time.",
        "3... Bg4": "nice pin on knight. I like to play this move.",
        "4. Nbd2": "to maintain knight on f3 is exchange is played.",
        "4... Nf6 5. h3": "don't like that bishop hanging around there!",

        "8... Bxe2": "as expected.",
        "9. Qxe2 Bxe5 10. dxe5": "the game is somewhat simplified now but I'm not too happy with my position after these exchanges.",
        "10... Nfd7 11. O-O Nxe5": "oops! forgot to defend the pawn. Big mistake and now I'm material down.",
        "12. f4 Nec6 13. Qg4": "attacking g7.",
        "13... Qf6 14. e4": "intending attack on queen with 15.e5 or 14.dxe4 15.Nxe4",
        "14... h5": "clever counter attack.",
        "15. Qe2 dxe4 16. Nxe4 Qg6 17. Ng5 O-O 18. Qb5": "attacking b7.",
        "18... b6": "but easy to defend, however blacks c6 knight now under pressure",
        "19. f5 exf5 20. Rxf5": "building pressure on f7",
        "20... Ne7 21. Rf3": "Re5 may be better option. comments welcome...",

        "30... Nd4": "black's knights are very well positioned! lots of danger for white to think about now. f3 rook in big trouble, can be forked by d4 knight in many possible situations. 31.Ne2  is of particular concern.",
        "31. Nf4": "calculated risk by me here. if 31.Nxf3 I can play 32.gxf3 then gain g4 knight after queen moves to safety. however black can move queen to safety first. Moving my knight to f4 does however cover danger square e2.",
        "31... Qe4": "massive danger to white now.",

        "39... Qxg7 40. Qf4": "black must move king or queen or looses queen.",
        "40... Kf7 41. Rxg4 Qh8 42. Qc7+ Re7 43. Qxb6": "picking off a few pawn could help things later.",

        "53. Qc2": "...this was the move. Will end up a rook down after 53.Qxf2  54.Qxf2 54.Nxf2 55.Kxf2. this would be effectively game over, but if black fails to spot danger and plays Nxf2 first then I have the winning move 54.Qh7 ",
        "53... Nxf2": "wow! black didn't spot the danger! what a mistake!!",
        "54. Qh7+ Ke8 55. Rg8#": "What an escape this was for me! I deserved to loose this game from an early stage, but somehow snatched victory when I was on the verge of defeat. "
