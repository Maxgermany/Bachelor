        "1. d4": "This game is a Torre attack, where I played a less critical line than the line 3...c5, however, still gives Black a solid game after the most trying continuation 4. Bxf6.  My 2100 rated opponent, enters into this line, then let's off the accelerator with 5. e3, instead of the obvious 5. e4, with a central space advantage.  The position that results features a good example of play against an isolated d-pawn.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5": "The idea behind the bishop move is to exchange the defender of the e4-square and play e4.",
        "3... h6": "Modern theory regards inmmediately striking White's center with 3...c5 as the most critical test of White's opening strategy.  After 4. e3 Qb6 5. Qc1 Black gets a good game with 5...Ne4.",
        "4. Bxf6": "4. Bh4 c5 5. e3 b6 6. Nbd2 Bb7 7. Bd3 Be7 8.  0-0 d6 9. c3 Nbd7, and Black's Hedgehog-style setup gives him harmonius development with little pressure from White.",
        "4... Qxf6 5. e3": "White adopts a modest setup, choosing to establish a stable center before undertaking any attack.  Not really in the spirit of the opening, but Black doesnt have any immediate attack either.",
        "5... c5 6. Be2": "Again, 6. Bd3 is more aggressive.",
        "6... cxd4": "This move could have waited, however, I wanted to get the extra center pawn before White played c3, when the symmetrical pawn structure would have made things less dynamic.",
        "7. exd4 Nc6": "Now we are really out of book.  This knight typically goes to d7, however, with White's unambitious play, I decided to put the knight on a more aggressive square.",
        "8. O-O d5": "Having established the central pawn majority, I decided to part with it to play against the Isolanus, if White so chooses.  Maybe not the best strategy, however, I think Black can hold his own.",
        "9. c4": "White gets aggressive.",
        "9... dxc4": "Attempting to keep the position dynamic and since the position is opening, the loss of tempo in recapturing the pawn will help Black.",
        "10. Nc3": "White is ahead in development.  I need to get moving.",
        "10... Bd6": "Too slow would have been the typical bishop fianchetto of the Torre systems.  Here the dark-squared bishop goes to an active diagonal and fights for the e5-square.",
        "11. Bxc4": "Still behind in development and with an uncastled king, I am now looking down the barrel of a d5-break.",
        "11... Qf4": "Utilizing a pin to stop the break at the same time keeping the f3-knight tied to the defense of h2.  An active defense is the best solution.",
        "12. Qd3 O-O 13. Rad1": "If 13. d5 Ne5 14. Nxe5 Qxe5 15. g3 ed and Black is fine.",
        "13... Rd8": "Preventing d5 again via 14...Ne5 15. Nxe5 Bxe5 threatening mate and hitting the queen, and after 16. Qg3 Qxc4 Black is down a piece.",
        "14. Rfe1": "Anticipating an opening of the e-file.",
        "14... Bd7": "The only real problem with the Black position is the light-sqared bishop.  Here I clear a space for the a8-rook, but temporarily block any discovery tactics on the d-file from the d8-rook.  This was the major trade off.  In absence of any active plan, White is going to get a space advantage on the queenside, in addition to his advantage in the center, and I would slowly suffocate.  Here I can at least develop my pieces and get some counterplay on the open files.",
        "15. a3 Rac8 16. Ne4 Be7": "Better than ...Bb8, as the pressure against h2 is not as potent as White's queenside and center pressure.  Here I can swing the Bishop to f6 and to g7 after ...g6 if necessary.",
        "17. b4 Rc7": "17...a6 is also a possiblity, however, I believe this move is stronger as it prepares to double on either file and 18. b5 Na5 gives Black control of the c-file.",
        "18. Ba2 a6": "This is now necessary, as ...Na5 doesn't come with tempo.",
        "19. d5": "The attack commences.",
        "19... exd5 20. Nc3": "The only move, White threatens to recover the pawn and exchance of one of the Black bishops, which are a substantial advantage in an open position.",
        "20... Be6 21. Nxd5 Bxd5 22. Bxd5 Rcd7": "White is probably slightly better if the situation isnt just equal.  Black has good play on the d-file, the pawn structure is symmetrical and there is an opposite colored bishop situation.  White has succeded in liquidating his isolated pawn and his only weakness is on a3, which Black can't exploit.  On the other hand, Black has a weakness on b7 and on g6, which is easier for White to exploit as he has the light-squared bishop.",
        "23. Qb3": "White breaks the pin and takes aim at f7.",
        "23... Bf8": "Black overprotects f7 and gets the bishop out of the way of any future tactics from the rook on e1.",
        "24. h3 Qf6 25. Rd3 Ne7 26. Be4 Rd7xd3 27. Bxd3 Nf5": "not aiming for d4, as after 28...Nxd4 Qxd4 29. Rd1, Black is in serious trouble.",
        "28. Qc2 Nd6": "The plan is to restrict the light-squared bishop and hopefully trade it off, when Black would have some winning chances due to the bishop vs knight situation with pawns on both sides of the board.",
        "29. Qb3 g6": "Preparing to get the bishop to a more active diagonal.",
        "30. a4 Bg7 31. Re5": "This move took me by surprise, as White increases his pressure and prevents any attempts at swapping queens.",
        "31... Rc8 32. Rc5 Re8": "After the exchange, the pawn on c5 would kick the knight to a less active square, and White would be clearly better.",
        "33. Rc1 Qf4 34. Rc7 Qf6 35. b5 axb5 36. axb5": "After 36. Bxb5 Nxb5 37. Qxb5 Qa1  38. Kh2 Be5  39. Qxe5 Rxe5 40. Rxb7 Re2, followed by ...Ra2 and the game is a theoretical draw.",
        "36... Ra8 37. Rd7 Bf8 38. Qd5 Ra1+": "Faced with a defensive task, the move that gives your pieces the most activity is most often the best move.  Here the rook can attack from behind, in addition to keeping White pieces tied down as well.",
        "39. Bf1 Rb1 40. Ne5 h5": "Keeping the knight out of g4.",
        "41. g3 Rb2": "Here White timed out.  Good for my rating, but the endgame was just getting interesting."
