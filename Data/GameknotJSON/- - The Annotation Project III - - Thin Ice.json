        "1. e4": "Black has the biggest challenge in this new opening. Its been discussed between Freddy and I if it isn't worth taking the perpetual from blacks point of view. Black has one critical line chance though it doesn't look all that appealing either. Lets start the game on move 6 where the conditional moves run out.",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4": "Black has accepted the sacrifice and now must go on defense for the slight material gain. The king on b6 will be common place in this tournament.",
        "7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+": "Forcing the recapture of the knight. A waste of this complex game would be to repeat Ke8 Bf7 Kd7 Be6 and Ke8 Bf7+ draw though as mentioned before may be blacks best chance.",
        "8... Kc7 9. Bxg4 Kb6": "Getting away from the fork Ne6 and allowing white the chance to make an error.",
        "10. Ne6": "The correct move as far as I'm concerned. Stops the development of the dsb and the h8 rook which will be locked in most of blacks games. ",
        "10... Qe8 11. d3": "This is the critical test for black to overcome due to the destructive power of the c1 bishop and the b1 knight as soon will be seen.",
        "11... Qg6": "?? this is the first error crazy how quickly the game slides into whites favor over a move that doesn't look or seem all that bad. The test to see if black can survive will be 11... c5 where white has some options: Na3, Be3 b4 and a4 all look okay my preference though I haven't looked at it too deeply yet would be Na3 then Be3. 11... c5 being the best chance doesn't give much hope to blacks game.",
        "12. Na3": "!! Qxg4 loses right away with Nc4+ Kb5 (Ka6 Nc7#) Nc7+ option 1 Kc5 Be3+ Kb4 c3(a3)+ Ka4 b3# option 2 Kb4 c3+ Ka4 (Kc5 Be3#) b3# option 3 Ka4 c3(a3) and now there is no way to stop b3# Two lines I looked at where a5 and c5 *Freddy suggests Qxe6*. The fact is they lead to the loss of queen or mate. 12... a5 13. Be3+ c5 (Ka6 Nc7#) 14. Nc4+ black now has four choices 1) 14... Kc6 Ne5+ winning the queen. 2) 14... Ka7 15. Bxc5 b6 (Ka7 Nc7#) 16. Bxb6+ Ka6 [Kb7 17. Nd8+ Ka6 18. Bc8+ Kb5 19. a4+ Kb4 20. c3+ Kb3 21. Ra3+ Kc2 22. O-O couldn't find away to avoid mate here] 17. Nc5+ Kb5 18. Kc6 Ne5+ and the game goes to white. 3) Ka6 15. Nxc5+ Kb5 [Ka7 16. Ne6+ Ka6 17. Nc7#] 16. a4+ Kc6 [Kb4 17. c3#] 17. Ne5+ winning the queen if not more here. 4) Kb5 15. a4+ now Three choices A) Kb4 16. c3+ Kb3 17. Nxc5+ Kc2 18. Rc1+ B) Ka6 16. Nxc5+ Ka7 17. Ne6+ b6 [Ka6 Nc7#] 18. Bb6+ Ka6 (Kb7 19. Nd8+ Ka6 20. Bc8#) 19. Nc5+ C) Kc6 16. Ne5+ wins the queen and mates Kd6 Bxc5+ Kd5 c4# (Kb6 Bc5+ Ka6 Nc7# or Kd5 c4+ Kd6 Bc5#). Probably missed a few ideas here and there, but as mentioned the best outcome for black is loss of queen.",
        "12... c5": "I figured I'd just go ahead and give up my queen.",
        "13. Nc4+ Kc6": "Ka6 Nc7# Kb5 a4+ Kb4 c3+ Kb3 Nxc5+ Kc2 Bd1#",
        "14. Ne5+ Kd6 15. Nxg6 hxg6 16. dxe4 Na6": "Trying to open up lines for my dsb and defend it again so I can move my h8 rook.",
        "17. e5+ Kc6 18. Be3 Nc7 19. Nxc5 e6 20. Bf3+ Kb5 21. a4+ Kc4 22. b3+ Kb4 23. c3+": "Kxc3 would be mate I'm not sure if Freddy made a puzzle on it so I'm not going to show it. Ka5 also leads to mate.",
        "23... Ka5 24. b4+ Kb6 25. Nxe6+ Bc5 26. Bxc5+ Ka6 27. Nxc7#": "Hopefully this gives a peek into how difficult this game can be."
