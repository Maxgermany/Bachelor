My best guess is that Black is going to do Nxg3 so that I will do hxg3 and he can do Rxh1+, but his next move isn't what I had originally thought. ",

I almost actually did not see this checkmate at first; on move seventeen, I was going to do Nxd5 and take the unprotected pawn, but then played around a little bit and found the mate. It's been a while since I've played a full game of chess and I'm a bit rusty. Guess I should brush up on strategy and tactics a bit! :)"
