The biggest mistake I made in this game is that I didn't move many pieces, because I was trying to attack (which epicly failed), and I spent half of my turns moving pieces, which means he was like 10 moves ahead, which is terrible. Rooks aren't good in cluttered positions like these because you can't move them very far. I never developed much pieces, and thats my big #1 mistake right their. Hope you enjoyed this annotation."
