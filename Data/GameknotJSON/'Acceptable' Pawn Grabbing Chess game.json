Ne2 Rb8 10. c3 b5": "This is a classic Closed Sicilian structure,where White attacks on the King-side,whereas Black launches an attack down the Queen-side.Black is hoping to soften White on the dark squares.",
        "11. g4 f5": "Always a good move to play,when White plays g4.",

        "30. Bf3 Qb3": "!! White's last move was to protect his Knight,and stop the possible check on d1.\nBut now this thunderbolt places White on the back foot,as he cannot take the Queen,otherwise he would lose a piece,or the pawn would queen! He now has to give up a 2nd pawn.",
