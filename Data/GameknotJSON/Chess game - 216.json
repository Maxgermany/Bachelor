        "4. Bc4": "Bc4 Allowing myself to castle king side and also bishop is on a very important line.\nBut maybe i should have sacrificed my knight playing Nxe5 fxe5; Bxh6 gxh6; Qh6+ Ke7; Qxe5+ wining a rock and opponent's king would be in the middle of the board. \nI believe that it would have been better move than Bc4 because my opponent was greedy enough to fall in the trap.",
