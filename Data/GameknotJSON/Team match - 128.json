        "1. e4": "Standard opening, freeing up diagonals for Queen and Bishop",
        "1... e6": "Black goes for the french defense.\n\n I haven't played this opening before, so instead of checking out youtube videos or whatever, i decided to go with my gut....\n",
        "2. d4": "... by an obvious (at least to me) move. \n2. d4 seizes control of the center and opens up a diagonal for the Queen's bishop.",
        "2... d5": "Black puts a stake at the center and attacks my e-pawn, simultaneously freeing up a diagonal for his DSB.\n\nActually looking back this opening is very nice, as Black's d-pawn is now protected twice.",
        "3. f3": "Defending my e-pawn.\nKinda not a big fan of this move, since that square is meant for the g-knight.\nNc3 would have been better, defending my e-pawn and developing a piece at the same time.",
        "3... a6": "Preventing Bb5+\n\nIn retrospect i understand why Black would do that, but it's ultimately not a very good move, as he moved a pawn instead of developing a piece.\nSo i respond to this move....",
        "4. a3": ".. By doing the same! ahahah :)\nLots of good, developing moves could have been done instead.",
        "4... Nc6": "Black starts developing, at the same time attacking my d-pawn.",
        "5. Be3": "I decide to develop my DSB, defending the d-pawn twice",
        "5... Be7": "Black develops his DSB on the excellent square e7.\nI love this move! It protects the King, and takes control of two strong diagonals.",
        "6. Nc3": "More development, attacking e4 and d5 squares.",
        "6... h6": "Again to prevent a move like Bg5.\n\nOnce again i understand the intention behind it as i also do that a lot, but in my opinion this is a bit of a waste of a move, that will ultimately put Black in a bad position in this game.",
        "7. e5": "I seize the opportunity to take control of the e5 square!\nThe e-pawn is protected by the d-pawn, and is attacking two key squares, one of which (f6) prevents black from moving his g-knight.\n\n",
        "7... b6": "Gives Black's LSB space to develop, since he doesn't want to cramp up his Queen's path.\nMy guess is that he wanted to advance his a-pawn eventually and get the LSB in the game.\n",
        "8. Bd3": "Taking control of another very good diagonal, and especially preventing Black's Rook from leaving its original post.\n\nAt this point, White's development is almost complete, with a good control of the center squares.\nBlack is a bit cramped up, most of his pieces still being in their home squares. His DSB on e7 is very nice, but his kingside is very weak at the moment, and will be the target of my attack.",
        "8... Bb7": "Getting the LSB off the back rank, and defending his knight.",
        "9. Nh3": "I actually spent quite some time pondering this move.\ni stopped myself from moving 9.f4, 9.Qd2/9.Qe2 or even 9.Ne2.\nit was important to me to finish developing and placing a piece on the kingside where i wanted to attack.",
        "9... b5": "?\n\nMoving into the queenside.\nBut why not 9. ... a5 ?\nMaybe was afraid of of Bxa6 ?\nIt was probably a better idea to Qd7 and allowing the king to castle..",
        "10. f4": "Protects the e-pawn, and frees up an important diagonal for my queen.",
        "10... g5": "Attacking f-pawn. If i will take, his h-rook will be set free. Cannot have that, so i will go with something else.",
        "11. Qh5": "This move pins a pawn to the already cramped up rook, and more importantly pins a pawn to Black's king!",
        "11... gxf4": "Takes my f-pawn.\nHe has now doubled pawns on the f-file, and i must deal with the f4 one.",
        "12. Bxf4": "My DSB leaves its post to take the f4 pawn.\nd-pawn is now unprotected.\n\nI could have probably taken with Nxf4, but what i didn't like about that was the position the knight would have been in afterwards.",
        "12... Bf8": "DSB now defends g7 in case i decide to place my queen in there.",
        "13. Bd2": "Looks like a bit of a mistake i made there.\nI meant to free the f-file, but it would probably been more effective to move Be3, going back to defending the d-pawn, which is now hanging....",
        "13... Nxd4": "... And black takes it, rightly so, freeing up c6 , and placing his knight in a strong central position.\nFrom here he's attacking different squares and is potentially dangerous, but he needs backup!",
        "14. O-O": "Castling protects my king, and seizes control of the f-file.\nthe poor f7 pawn is now attacked twice, and pinned to Black's king.\nHe will be the target of my attack plan.\n",
        "14... Qd7": "Gets the queen off the back rank.\nAt this point i was sure black was going to castle on the queenside next.",
        "15. Ng5": "F7 pawn is now attacked thrice. Black cannot take my knight with his h-pawn because it's pinned to the h-rook.\n\nWith this move i was actually hoping to win material, namely the cramped up rook and knight on the kingside.",
        "15... Bc6": "??\nWhy not castling? \n\nThis move defends two pawns that are already well defended, and defends the queen.\nPerhaps Black was hoping to exchange queens while keeping his castling option open.",
        "16. Rxf7": "But it's now too late, the decisive attack starts!\nmy rook now attacks black's queen, and is hiding a discovered check on the King.\n\nAgain, my greatest hope at this stage was to win material, as there were several ways for black to escape checkmate, although all of these involved him losing strong pieces. like so:\n\n16. ... Qxf7 \n17.Nxf7 Bg7 \n18.Nxh8+\n\nor\n\n16. ... O-O-O\n17. Rxd7+ Kxd7\n18. Qf7+ ",
        "16... Qd8": "It looks like a blunder.\nI understand not wanting to lose the queen, however this move blocks Black's king.\nBetter would have been 16. ... Qd8 giving space to the king, although it would have been followed up with 17 Rxc7+ Kd8 18.Rxc8",
        "17. Rh7#": "Checkmate!"
