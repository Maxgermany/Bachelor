        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6": "to put white out of the more common tracks...",
        "4. c3": "curious move by white he went back to an old line... d4 is considered better for white since the 80's, and ever since this 3...g6 variation lost it's appeal (Smyslov played it a few dozen games with it)",
        "4... a6 5. Ba4 Nf6": "develops and still invites white to play Bxc6... if d4 I have Nxe4.. the c3 pawn hinders white development, and I'm not planing to exchange exd4 to solve his problem for him!",
        "6. O-O Bg7 7. Re1 O-O 8. Bxc6 dxc6": "now I'll have a worst structure and be minus a pawn, but I'll have the bishop pair and better control over the light squares",
        "9. Nxe5 Re8 10. f4": "predictable, white aims to gain space",
        "10... Nd7": "he is underdeveloped is time to propose an exchange of his better placed piece",
        "11. Nxd7 Bxd7 12. d4": "again wins him some space...",
        "12... c5": "challenging the center",
        "13. e5": "yet another structural weakening move...",
        "13... Bc6": "this controls the h1-a8, I can now proceed to block the position and wait for an easy draw, or expect for white to play for a win and risk a loss...",
        "14. Be3": "white's bishop is blocked by his own pawns",
        "14... Qd7": "white's poor control over the light squares offers me some counter-play, he can't progress any more than this",
        "15. Qc2 Rad8": "placing another rook on a semi-open column can only be good for me",
        "16. Nd2 cxd4": "I exchange pawns to get a better control over the d5 square, after the exchange white doesn't have any pawn to push my bishop out of that square",
        "17. cxd4 Bf8": "to bring my bishop to a more active square e7 via f8...",
        "18. Ne4": "immediately white replied with a threat to play Nf6 with double attack on queen and king",
        "18... Be7": "as planed",
        "19. Nc3": "white makes the best of his Ne4 move replacing the knight on c3 a more active square eyeing d5",
        "19... b5": "Intending to play b4 to force the knight of c3 and gain some space",
        "20. Rac1": "?! black didn't considered the threat to further block the position with b4",
        "20... b4": "as planed",
        "21. Ne4": "expected Bd5 next move but I'll take my time to play it to avoid having this game ended before others in this tournament... it seams we are headed for a draw",
        "21... Bd5": "now white has the chance to make a blunder Qxc7 meets Qxc7 Rxc7 Bxe4 and I'm a piece up for two pawns",
        "22. b3 a5": "with c5 secured against any sudden infiltration, I get to consolidate my b pawn, also avoiding any tactics related to a double attack on the a pawn and queen by the knight with Nc5...",
        "23. Ref1 Qf5": "and the consequent exchange of queens will probably end in a draw, because although a pawn up white can't make use of his dark squares bishop nor dislodge my light squares bishop from any of the blocking central squares",
        "24. Nc5 Qxc2 25. Rxc2 c6": "again adding further consolidation to the queen's wing after the exchange of queens white needs to sacrifice a quality to infiltrate my position",
        "26. Na4 Rda8": "offering the exchange to guarantee the draw",
        "27. Rd2 Bd8": "freeing the e column to threaten f5",
        "28. g4": "white reacts on the king's wing...",
        "28... f5": "as planed now white doesn't have exf5 ep...",
        "29. g5 h6": "adding some tension to keep alive some chances to fight for a win, because the other game against this opponent has gone sour for me, and means a highly probable lost game... ",
        "30. Kf2": "brings in the king, but it can't make any progress",
        "30... Ra7": "prepares to double rooks if needed",
        "31. h4 Rh7 32. Kg3 Kf7": "freeing the last rank to double rooks on the h column and to get the king in the middle to aid in the defense of the passed e pawn",

        "35. Rh2": "forced",
        "35... Bc7 36. Rc1 Bd8 37. Rf1 Bc7": "now I don't see any more to do rather than hope for some mistake by white... higly probable a draw as stated a few moves before"
