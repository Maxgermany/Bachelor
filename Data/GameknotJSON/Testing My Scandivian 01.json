        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+": "I read once an article called \"the Qa5 phallacy\". So I play this \"my\" way. ",
        "4. Be2 c6": "The key move, to prevent the knight's nasty jumps.",
        "5. d4": "The good one. Normally, lower rated players go Nf3, that is not bad. But the played one has poison in it.",
        "5... Qa5": "Yes, now, it's a loss of tempo. But white cannot do much, despite the aggressive playing he can display. This is the \"bet\" of this line. ",
        "6. Nf3": "From now on, white has the fantastic d5! that opens my game and is often lethal for black. \nBut, for some reason, almost nobody plays it! ",
        "6... Bf5": "I cannot defend against d5 with e3 because I trap my own bishop. After this, black is cramped. It is to be seen if black can consider it a \"lock\" and hold the game with it. ",
        "7. O-O": "Second and last lost chance to play d5.",
        "7... e6": "Now d5 holds, but white has a ready-made attack with Re1. I still bet black can handle that.",
        "8. Bf4": "Ok, good, this is the poisonous diagonal. White has the advantage here, I admit it. ",
        "8... Bb4": "The normal one is Nf6, with a known game. I tried something new.",
        "9. Bxb8": "? the bishop is much, much more valuable than the knight. Probably, white wanted to prevent a short-to-come o-o-o, that is somewhat double-edged, but is still my favourite, since it places the rook on the best spot connecting the rooks. ",
        "9... Rxb8": "Ok, so no o-o-o. Hmmm...",
        "10. d5": "Nice, and at last played. If cxd, Bb5+!, and if exd, Re1 becomes dangerous. So I tried to mix things up.",
        "10... Bxc3": "The main reason for this is that the knight covered the bishop's check in b5. ",
        "11. dxe6 Bxe6 12. bxc3": "The pawn is less important than the initiative. I have to shield my king, and quickly!",
        "12... Rd8": "...but this move only helps him in defending c3 with tempo. A mistake.",
        "13. Qe1 Nf6 14. Bc4 Nd5": "Just in time. All of a sudden, the game becomes tactical!",
        "15. Nd4": "So it is seems than the f pawn will be taken on e6 sooner or later. I looked for the circumstance it would have been less dangerous for black. ",
        "15... Qxc3": "Anything but a queen on the central columns. ",
        "16. Qxc3 Nxc3 17. Nxe6 fxe6 18. Bxe6": "The less dangerous position for black is reached. I am pretty sure Rd7 is black's best move, but I was staring at an elegant knight replacement. ",
        "18... Ne2+ 19. Kh1 Nf4": "I'm not sure the knight is better here than in c3, but his king is in a tunnel, and this can be important if endgame is reached. ",
        "20. Rfe1 Nxe6 21. Rxe6+ Kf7": "Again, the less dangerous position for black. I'm not playing to win, but to hold would be a kind of victory for me. ",
        "22. Rae1 Rhe8": "The line after Rd2 instead of this is bad for black. Both white rooks penetrate, even if white must lose a tempo in order to free his king. No time to calculate, so I went for drawn. ",
        "23. Re6xe8 Rxe8 24. Rxe8 Kxe8": "Now, THIS is an endgame. And black has not the worst part of it!",
        "25. f4 Ke7 26. g4 Ke6 27. Kg2 Kd5 28. Kf3 Kd4": "I know my king cannot reach the c2 pawn, even if offered (c3, Kd5), because currently I \"lose the race\" if the king is too far. ",
        "29. f5": "? This is not the right path, I fear... c3 was needed. Or h4.",
        "29... Ke5": "Thanks, white, you gave me the best place for my king. ",
        "30. h4 b5": "My turn to go on. White is blocked on the queenside!",
        "31. a3 a5 32. c3 c5 33. Ke3 b4 34. cxb4 cxb4 35. axb4 axb4": "...and white must resign, since while stopping the b pawn, I can take all his pawns. It is very rare for me to get such a \"technical\" victory, with no sacrifices or big mistakes. This makes me a little proud of this game. :-)"
