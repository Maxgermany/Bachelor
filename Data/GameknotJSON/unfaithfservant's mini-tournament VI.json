        "1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3": "The initial phase of Morra's Gambit. The idea is to mobilize the pieces quickly to good squares and to get Black out of book and make uncoordinated moves--which usually happens. A pawn is sacrificed to do this however.",
        "4... Nc6 5. Bc4 e6 6. Nf3 Bb4": "Bb4? This bishop is needed for defense and not put into a position for trading for White's weak bishop, or worse, the knight on c3.",
        "7. O-O Nge7 8. Bf4 a6 9. Bd6": "Bd6! Already pressuring  Black's poor set-up. ",
        "9... Bxc3 10. bxc3": "Leaving the very strong bishop at d6 and trading his strongest piece.",
        "10... b5 11. Bb3 Na5 12. Qd3 Nxb3 13. axb3": "Not even an isolated pawn anymore for compensation. These pawns are strong and the rook is now activated--but the queenside is not where I'm going to be.",
        "13... Bb7 14. Rfd1": "The d file can't be contested now. His dark squares are very weak because of the missing bishop.",
        "14... Bc6 15. Ne5 f6 16. Nxc6 Nxc6 17. Qg3 Kf7": "What else?  White has an unusual advantage for being a pawn down, but something has to be done immediately with it.",
        "18. Rd3 e5 19. Rad1 Ra7 20. Bc5 Rb7 21. Qg4 Nb8 22. Qh5+ g6 23. Qh6 Qc8 24. Bd6 Nc6": "I'm thinking of tripling up on the d file with the queen but a continuation I looked at had me not only losing the advantage but the game as well! The exchanges led to Black queening a pawn with his knight protecting it.",
        "25. f4": "f4! to start busting up that weak king on the f file.",
        "25... Qe8 26. f5 a5 27. Bc5 b4": "b4? There is no time for that.",
        "28. Rd3d6": "This didn't trigger any worries for Black so perhaps another won pawn will help...",
        "28... bxc3 29. Rxf6+": "Rxd6!! A shot. The king is undefended and I'm also being pressured on the queen-side so this move became very necessary.",
        "29... Kxf6 30. fxg6": "Black resigned here because of the coming mate threat or material loss. fxg6,..hxg6, Rf1+,..Ke6, Qg7!  Black couldn't move properly after 9)...Bxc3 due to his dark- squared weaknesses.",
        "30... hxg6 31. Rf1+ Ke6 32. Qg7 Rf8 33. Rxf8": ""
