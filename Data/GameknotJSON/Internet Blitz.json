        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Nc3": "Transposing into the often deadly dull Four Knights' Game. Ng5, d4 or d3 would lead to the ultra-sharp Two Knights' Defense.",
        "4... Bb4 5. d3": "Necessary, as 0-0 would run into the fork trick 7. ...Nxe4! 8. Nxe4 d5, with a positional plus. (7. ...Bxc6?! 8. dxc6 Nxe4?, on the other hand, is a mistake due to the thematic fork Qd5!)",
        "5... Nd4": "? Moving the same piece twice, neglecting castling, and undefending the e-pawn. \nThere are lines of the Four Knights' where Black can play this move successfully, but not when White is so well-developed. Black should have followed principles and castled here, or played ...d6.\nIt is important to recognize and make use of inviting squares like d4, and so Black's impulse here is basically good. The problem is timing -- we can only make one move at a time in chess, and redeploying an already-developed piece, even to a really nice square, usually needs to wait in line behind developing the other pieces and castling the King to safety.",
        "6. O-O": "!? As far as I can tell, White can safely grab the pawn here, though things can get dicey:\nNxe5!? d5 7. exd5 and now ...Qe7, ...Nxd5 and ...0-0 all seem insufficient, though I admit I didn't properly analyze any of them. I encourage others to post their own analysis -- especially you, Kyle, who could consider getting a board out and playing through the lines as some useful practice.\n\nInstead, White plays for a safe edge (he's still up in development), which is understandable in a blitz game.\n\nNote that Nxd5? is a poor choice because, after ...exd5, the other Knight on c3 is pinned.",
        "6... d6 7. Bg5 h6 8. Bxf6": "? Ugh!!!!!\nThis Bishop makes a very annoying pin, which gives White a lot of pressure. White could maintain the pin with Bh4, and now Black will be hesitant to play ...g5 unless he absolutely has to. \nI believe that White made this move thinking that he had a tactical justification based on a fork at d5, but that was a miscalculation. Much better would be to retreat to h4 and THEN aim for Nd5, piling on the pinned Knight.\nIt is usually not a good idea to trade off Bishops for Knights without a good reason in open games, (because the Bishops' long reach are so useful when there are open diagonals) and that is especially true of this particular Bishop, which is 1) White's \"Good Bishop\" (notice that most of White's pawns are on light squares, so that this Bishop complements them very well) and 2) exerting a lot of pressure with this pin,",
        "8... Qxf6 9. Nd5": "!? White thinks he's won a piece, but Black can just wriggle out...",
        "9... Nxf3+": "!",
        "10. Qxf3": "gxf3 would be met with a Queen check, after which Black could save the Bishop and start a potential attack on the Black King besides.\n\nThis move does not win the Bishop, either, but it ensures that White will be the only player doing any attacking from now on.",
        "10... Qxf3 11. gxf3 Ba5 12. b4": "!\nKeeping up the pressure, and depriving Black of the valuable pair of Bishops.",
        "12... Bb6 13. a4": "! \nAnd now Black needs to be verrrrrry careful, or else the Bishop gets trapped.",
        "13... Bh3": "This just barely works -- 14. a5 Bd5 15. c3 Bxf1 16. Rxf1 c6! and Black will be up the exchange.",
        "14. Rfe1": "d1 or b1 seem more active squares.",
        "14... O-O-O": "? Missing the threat\n...c6! was best, and after 15. Nxb6+ axb6 (note that the King still defends the f-pawn, Black can castle _Kingside_ and has no real problems.",
        "15. Nxb6+": "Good enough, but even better is: \n15. a5 Bd5 16. c3 c6 17. cxd4 cxd5 18. Bxd5 exd4 19. Bxf7 -- it also wins a pawn, but doing it this way would make the extra little guy a protected passed pawn.",
        "15... cxb6 16. Bxf7 Rhf8 17. Bh5": "! Excellent, forcing immediate exchanges. \nBeing up a pawn, every piece traded off brings White closer to an easy endgame.",
        "17... Rfg8 18. Bg4+ Bxg4 19. fxg4": "Now with an extra pawn and the weak pawn on f3 gone, White should be able to win this with a little technique. Still, there is a lot of room for error at the amateur level -- Rook ending are notoriously tricky.",
        "19... Kd7": "! Good start, activating the King and paving the way for operations on the c-file.",
        "20. a5": "Trying to make some open lines...",
        "20... bxa5": "? And helping White out a little too much. Black should try and keep things closed with ...b5! The one good thing about having a missing f-pawn and doubled b-pawns is that Black has two half-open files for his Rooks to point down, while White has none as of yet. There is no way to absolutely prevent White from creating open files for his Rooks, but Black should certainly not be making it this easy.",
        "21. Rxa5": "! Much better than bxa5, this takes immediate advantage of the chance to seize a half-open file.",
        "21... Rda8": "? \nNormally, it is better to defend with pieces instead of pawns, since pawns can't go backwards. In this case, however, there is no way for the Rook to defend the a-pawn and so ...a6 was forced. White will be able to blow things open with b4, but in the meantime Black could be activating his own Rooks rather than walking them into a self-pin.",
        "22. c4": "? \nMissing the win of a pawn by Rea1 (...a6 is met with b4, and the pawn is pinned thanks to Black's misguided ...Ra8.)",
        "22... b6": "? creating a backward pawn, which will give White both an additional pawn to capture and a way into the Black position.\n\nBetter was ... a6, and now if Rea1, Black has time to step out of the pin with ...Rac8.",
        "23. Ra6": "! Blockading the backward pawn.",
        "23... Kc7": "The King hurries to defend the a-pawn. ",
        "24. b5": "Rae1 right away would also be fine, but this move clamps down Black's Queenside even more.",
        "24... Rgf8": "! Good, finally using the half-open file. Black needs counterplay!",
        "25. Rea1 Rf3": "?? Now we see a series of mutual oversights. 26. Rxa7+ Rxa7 27. Rxa7+ Kb8 28. Ra3! (Rxg7 Rxd3 is messier) and White has two pawns to the good.\n\n...Kb7 was simple, necessary and good. Counterplay is good and all, but because White can take the a-pawn with check, Black has no time to do anything with the f3-Rook anyways.",
        "26. Ra1a3 g5": "?? ...Kb7 is forced.",
        "27. Kg2 Rf4": "Again, White can take the pawn with check.",
        "28. f3 Rff8": "?? ...Kb7. Seriously, guys.",
        "29. Ra6xa7+": "Finally!!!!",
        "29... Rxa7 30. Rxa7+ Kb8": "Best. Of course not ...Kc8, losing the Rook to Ra8+. ",
        "31. Ra6": "? Having gotten to the 7th rank with so much effort, White should have stayed there with Rd7. Then, Black's Rook has to go passive with ...Rf6, while the Black King is confined to the last rank. White can play set up h4 ando/r d4 and so on at his leisure.",
        "31... Kb7": "! good, locking the Rook out again.",
        "32. Kg3 Rc8 33. h4": "Stymied on the Queenside, White sensibly opens a new front far away from where the Black King is tied down.",
        "33... Kc7": "? Breaking the seal, and giving Black another chance at Ra7+ and Rh7, winning yet another pawn.",
        "34. Ra7+ Kb8 35. Ra6": "?? Rh7!\n\nRooks on the 7th rank are powerful, people. Jump at your chances to use them!",
        "35... Kb7 36. h5": "?\n\nQuoi????? White's task here is to open lines, not close them. This move makes White's task far harder because now there's no way in on the Kingside. (Though, when you're up two pawns, things tend to stay pretty easy even after gigantic positional blunders.)",
        "36... Kb8": "?? \n\nThis had to be time pressure. Why give up a perfectly good pawn?",
        "37. Kf2": "? Fortunately, White is not paying attention. Clocks must have been pretty low at this point.",
        "37... Kb7 38. Ke3": "White has the right idea, opening up in the last place available, the center.",
        "38... Kc7": "? And again allowing Ra7+. Black needs to waste moves with his Rook, and leave his King alone on the key b7 post.",
        "39. Ra4": "Pointless, Ra7+ Kb8 40. Rh7 wins easily.",
        "39... Kb7 40. d4": "Breaking through -- finally. The fortress crumbles.",
        "40... exd4+ 41. Kxd4 Rf8 42. Ra3 Kc7 43. Kd5": "Even better than Ra7+, which, of course, still wins. ",
        "43... Re8 44. Ra7+ Kb8 45. Rf7": "Now Rh7 is met by ...Rf6, but Rd7 is game over -- the d-pawn will fall, Black will have to trade Rooks or else lose the h- and b-pawns, and White's King can easily shepherd a pawn -- the e-pawn, say -- to promotion.",
        "45... Rd8 46. Rf6 Kc7 47. Kd4": "?? This doesn't lose, but the question marks are for bad form. \nWhen you've got your man (or woman) in a noose, you don't go take a walk around the block. You end it cleanly and put him/her out of his misery. White should just play the crushing move Rxh6, ( or Rf7+ -> Kc6) promote the h-pawn, and checkmate already. Should take 10 moves, tops.\nThis is a waste of time, which can be fatal in a blitz game and is just clumsy and rude in general.",
        "47... d5": "?? Ummmmm....",
        "48. exd5 Rxd5+ 49. Kxd5": "The game went on for seven more moves, but I'm going to stop annotating here because Black has basically given up (at the board -- maybe the clock held some glimmer of hope). \nA tough defensive task, but very instructive at each phase of the game."
