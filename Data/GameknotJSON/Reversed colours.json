        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. dxe6": "White omits here Bb4+, his best repy. ",
        "4... Bxe6 5. Be2 c6": "I decided to go for a simple developement line.",
        "6. d3 Bd6 7. h3": "Play this only if forced to, and better as a response than profilactic... anyway, it's in white's agenda.",
        "7... h6": "...so is this one. In fact, Ng5 is a nasty threat: I can't allow Ne6 to be exchanged by the N, leaving a poor pawn there. ",
        "8. O-O Qc7 9. Nbd2 Nbd7": "White is slow in developement, so I can reach one by one all my agenda's moves.",
        "10. Re1 O-O-O": "I will suffer from a white pawn's storm, but - specially in this white line - this will take more time than my own attack. ",
        "11. Nf1": "Interesting defensive move, opening the way for the dsb. This will be slow, so let's speed it up!",
        "11... g5": "White liked to play as black, and his desire is honoured.",
        "12. Nf3h2": "Another good defensive move, that makes me wonder how to break in. My pawns have to advance further, under the fire of white's B. I need h5 to prevent a piece to land on g4, to make impossible for white to play h5 (blocking the column) and assuring that g5 would have openend the column. I can't avoid right now his pieces to go to g5: the only thing I can do is to sac the g pawn (12... g5) and only after play Rg8, h5 etc. It was a blitz, so...",
        "12... Rdg8": "I can play h5 now, but I am allowing...",
        "13. Ng4 h5 14. Nxf6 Nxf6": "h5 goal, reached. Now, before g4, I have to push to h4, as before...",
        "15. Bd2": "White leaves it to me... well... it does threat something, I overlooked.",
        "15... h4 16. Bc3": "The normal move is Rh6, and it is probably the only and the best. ",
        "16... Qd8": "My force on h2 is not really useful right now. Still, a horrible move. ",
        "17. Bxf6": "...but my opponent made it a good one. Now my Q is again on an active spot, looking to f2.",
        "17... Qxf6 18. Bg4": "...and this is the price for my premature h4. Now I am under pressure, and I have to be very calm to defend. My Q on f6 comes to be a real annoyance, blocking my f pawn when needed. ",
        "18... Rge8": "My attack being blocked, my R has to return to duty. ",
        "19. Bxe6+": "White is happy with exchanging down and go to the endgame. ",
        "19... Rxe6 20. Qg4 Rhe8 21. c3": "I wouldn't have taken the pawn: white correctly spotted Bc5, my next move, attacking f2. In this way, he prevents it. ",
        "21... Kc7": "Unpinning the R. ",
        "22. Rxe6 Rxe6 23. Ne3": "This N goes to f5, he wants to take my B. I don't want to take it off the diag so easily. ",
        "23... Qg6": "Threat on d3 pending after the N jumps. ",
        "24. Qf5": "I can play this, but I won't exchange Q so easily. Just let me rearrange.",
        "24... Qg7 25. Kf1": "This is a plain loss of tempo, and besides, it gives me chances. ",
        "25... Rf6": "Now I threat Bg3. But...",
        "26. Qa5+": "This is nasty, too. If Kb8, Qd8# If b6, Qxh7+.",
        "26... Kc8 27. Ng4": "I should have sacrified on g5 before, no doubt. This square is my nightmare...",
        "27... Rf4 28. Qxa7 Qg6": "Qh8+ doesn't worry me... still.",
        "29. Qe3": "Qe8+, Kc7 leaves WQ just hanging over there. If Re1 is not played, of course.",
        "29... Qf5": "Increasing my pressure on f2. What else?",
        "30. Re1 Kc7": "No check if the Q leaves, and Qxd3+ would follow. ",
        "31. f3": "Solving his f2 problem at the cost of g3 for my lsb. Take note. ",
        "31... Ra4": "This is not to attack the pawn, but to make room for my B. Of course, I can't move it there now, or checks will start. But...",
        "32. a3 Ra5": "White should be able to win this by pushing those pawns, but I have to hope for a weakness.",
        "33. d4": "Preparing Ne5, probably. ",
        "33... Rb5": "Just inviting him to block my R with b4. Maybe I should have gone c5 instead. ",
        "34. Re2": "Wow! Look well to this move, and try to understand why this is a blunder. ",
        "34... Qb1+": "This seems to be a naive check, but after Re1, Qxb7, winning a pawn and opening the way for a massive penetration. White saw all that, and unfortunately played the alternate move too quickly, allowing a splendid...",
        "35. Kf2 Bg3#": "...mate! I hope you enjoyed this one. White made some mistake (so did I!), but overall he played very intelligent defensive moves in many occasions, don't falling in easy traps. "
