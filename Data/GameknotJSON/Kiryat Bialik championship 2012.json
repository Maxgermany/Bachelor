        "1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O d5 6. Nbd2 Nbd7": "so far so good , however because of the simetric structure of the game , white have small edge because he have the first move .",
        "7. c4": "if white want to keep the edge , he must be aggressive , playing 7.c4 attacking the only blacks central pawn d5 is very effective on this position , black have some choises here , he can play 7...c5 (a kind of contra attack on the white central pawn d4 , the great Akiba Rubinstein Polish very strong grandmaster of last century was known with these kind of ideas ), black can all so play 7...cxd4 which is not so good idea for my opinion because of after 8.Nxc4 the e5 sqaure is total controll of the white pieces , the 2 white knights taking very strong positions on that spot (e5) with the help of d4 its can be very useful for white and it is all so realising the white pieces that arent developet yet , while black  doesnt have a real good chances for having some contra play , another intresting  idea is 8.e4 giving away c4 pawn for total central controll which can be harmful for black . another option for black is 7...c6!? defending the d5 pawn which was played in the game .",
        "7... c6 8. b3": "the idea is to open the a1/h8 diagonal for the white DSB , and creat strong pawn chain on the queen side , but i think 8.Qc2 was better with the idea 9. e4 e5 .",
        "8... Re8": "black wishes to break whites center with e5 .",
        "9. Bb2 Nb6": "the idea is to open the diagonal c8/h3 for the LSB , and hope for white play c5 which the black knight retreat to d7 and by b6 attacking the c5 pawn it is all so opens the c8/a6 diagonal which the black LSB will find a good position on a6/f1 diagonal .",
        "10. Re1": "the idea is to advance e4 e5 taking more space and center  edge .",
        "10... a5": "point less for my opinion , better was 10...Qc7 with the idea of e5 attack the white center .",
        "11. Rc1 a4": "black waited that the white rook will move from the a file ,  now by a4 black wishes to open the a file to get some activity on the queen side .",
        "12. e4 dxe4 13. Nxe4 Nxe4 14. Rxe4": "to get som air black trys to exchange as more pieces as he can .",
        "14... Bf5": "good move attacking the rook on e4 and get developed on the same time .",
        "15. Re1 Qd7": "the idea is to try to exchange the LSBs on h3 or g2 however when the white rook is placed  on e1 instead of f1  there is no use because there is no longer pin on that rook and there for the white LSB can retreat to h1 and stay on the diagonal .",
        "16. Ne5": "good move , the white knight placed very good on e5 square and it is very hard for black to get it out without paying some price , either 16...Bxe5 .18.dxe5 and black stayes without his bishops pare , or 16...f6 .17.Nf3 and ther is some weaknes on e6 square and the h8/a1 diagonal is closed for the DSB on g7 , ofcourse he might remove his bishop to h6 and get some activity  but after Rc3 and Bc1 its unclear situation , but even if Bh6 white still much better .",
        "16... Qc7 17. b4 Red8": "activate the rook to d8 .",
        "18. Qf3": "maybe 18.Qe2 was better . for my opinion Qf3 with the ideacuas of Be6 and white didnt get much .",
        "18... f6 19. Nd3 e5": "good move , the idea is to attack the white center and its all so threats e4 and win a piece , and if  20.dxe5?-Rxd3! and black win a piece . ",
        "20. g4 e4 21. Qd1 Bxg4 22. Qxg4 exd3": "better was for my opinion 22...f5 to prevent a check and than exd3.",
        "23. Qe6+ Kh8 24. Rcd1 f5 25. Rxd3 Rd6": "great move forcing white to exchange his queen for a bishop and rook  what its far awy from wining the game .",
        "26. Qe8+ Rxe8 27. Rxe8+ Bf8 28. d5+": "taking right now the bishop wont give so much for white because of  28.Rxf8+-Kg7.29.c5-Kxf8.30.cxd6-Qxd6 . and the bishop that is pined doesnt worth so much any way .",
        "28... Kg8 29. c5 Qf7": "very imoprtant move , the black queen attacking the rook on e8 and get out from the attack after the one of the forked piece will be captured . but not 29...Rxd5?.30.cxb6 ( that is what i meant , why 29...Qf7 is very imortant move )-Qxb6.31.Bxd5+-cxd5 ant the material is evan .",
        "30. Rde3 Rxd5 31. cxb6": "better was 31.Bxd5-Qxd5.32.bxc6-Qxa2 and black is still slightly better .",
        "31... Rd1+ 32. Bf1": "mistake :better was 32.Re1-Rxe1.33.Rxe1 still black is better but now , the white LSB is pined and put it self for a target for blacks attack .",
        "32... Qc4 33. Re3e1 Rxe1 34. Rxe1 Qxb4": "the game is totaly lost for white , dangerous fork on the whites DSB and a rook and even after white trys to defend them  both by 35.Rb1 wont help at all after 35...Bg7 and white will lose a piece and the game .",
        "35. Rb1 Bg7": "thats it ! its over ! , or is it ?",
        "36. a3 Qxb6": "what horrible blunder ! , 36..Qb3! and the game is lost , black was to greedy ,and because of that he payed the price .",
        "37. Bc4+": "now black is totaly lost ! after the retreat of the black king to f8 or h8 (which is black square ) the retreat of the white  DSB which is capturing the blacks DSB with check!! will cause black to lose his queen and the game !!",
        "37... Kf8 38. Bxg7+ Kxg7 39. Rxb6": "and black resigns! hope you enjoyed the game ! that's my friends is one of the cruelties of chess or maybe we can say that some how justice have been done , what do you think ?"
