    "moves": {
        "1. Nf3": "I spent the week leading up to this game trying to decide between playing e4, d4 or c4. In the end I went with the Reti which is a first for me. I like to be unpredictable in my club games.",
        "1... Nf6": "black responds in kind.",
        "2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7": "the game looks to be heading toward a queenspawn game or else a symmetrical English",
        "4. b4": "?? However I decide to mix things up straight away. I wanted to get us out of any positions my more experienced opponent might be familiar with however this drops a pawn to ...Nd5!",
        "4... d5": "however my opponent is not paying close attention to the position and chucks out this move after thinking for about two seconds. ",
        "5. Bb2 c6 6. O-O Qb6": "probing at my position",
        "7. a3 a5 8. Bd4 Qc7": "I was thinking of playing Be5 here to see if black would consider a repetition however I couldn't find an answer to ...Qd8 where ...Nbd7 will be annoying.",
        "9. d3": "giving me the d2 square to develop to and bring me one step closer to playing the indicated c4 pawn advance.",
        "9... O-O 10. Nbd2 Nbd7": "black prepares for his indicated e5 advance however I think black should have looked to develop his LSB before playing this.",
        "11. c4 e5 12. Bb2 Re8": "I knew that there were was defiantly some pawn moves that were required around this point in the game, however I wasn't sure which pawns should be traded and which should advance so I kept the tension and placed my rook opposite the enemy queen.",
        "13. Rc1 axb4 14. axb4 Qb6": "I figured my b pawn was going to be bothersome this game so rather than waste resources dedicated to it's defence I came up with an interesting pawn sac.",
        "15. Ra1": "!? forcing a rook exchange however for the pawn white will get good pressure on the centre and some queenside files to pressure black with.",
        "15... Rxa1 16. Qxa1 Qxb4": "Unfortunately I cant win the e pawn back yet on account of my d2 knight hanging.",
        "17. cxd5": "Unfortunatly I cant win the e pawn back yet on account of my d2 knight hanging.",
        "17... Nxd5": "black played this quite quickly which tells me that he didn't put much thought into the other recapture, although it does isolate b7 I think it was worth at least looking at playing ...cxd, now my knight gets the good square on c4 and the d6 square and a3-f8 diagonal are going to cause black some problems.",
        "18. Nc4": "pressures e5 ",
        "18... f6": "ugly but probably forced now whites compensation is a little clearer, the a2-g8, a3-f8 and h3-c8 diagonals look as though they might be useful to white.",
        "19. e4": "once upon a time this move would never have crossed my mind however after playing chess for close to two years now I have learnt to start playing more dynamically. the weakening of the d pawn and structure will be made up for by the activity white will gain. this nudges at the black knight which when it moves will clear the a2-g8 diagonal ready for white to check the black king on.",
        "19... Nd5b6": "during the game I for some reason thought this was unplayable, I think I missed that this knight was protected by it's counterpart on d7.",
        "20. Ba3": "now I can play Nd6 and Qa2+",
        "20... Qb3": "!? this surprised me during the game. yes it attacks the d3 pawn but this just looks as though it leads to trouble for black since the queen has so few squares, still though the only other alternative is ...Qa4 21.Nd6 and after Re7 or Rf8 White appears to be doing alright after Qa2+",
        "21. Rb1": "I sac a second pawn, though this time I think my compensation is even clearer. The main point behind this is to prepare Qa2+",
        "21... Qxd3 22. Nd6": "I could have and probably should have played Nxb6 however I thought I could get more than the three pieces for the three pawns ",
        "22... Rf8": "it was either this or Re7 to avoid the dreaded smothered mate. Probably this is the better choice since it leaves the rook on a defended square.",
        "23. Qa2+ Kh8": "and now I played the winning move. See if you can find it. I'll try to leave some space between the diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n......",
        "24. Bb4": "Bb4! this quite move wins the exchange for white bringing back material parity, and if black isn't careful then the queen goes to. this move isn't so difficult when you go down the correct thought path however I was very pleased with myself having seen this several moves back and some people might not even consider trying to trap the queen especially when they see that after Bf1 the queen can take on the knight on f3.",
        "24... h6": "?? Black had to give back material by Playing ...Qa6 25.Nf7+ Rxf7 26.Qxf7 where I think white is slightly better.",
        "25. Bf1": "and with this move my opponent resigned. though truth be told black could have played on with clear mind since it would only be 2 pieces and two pawns for the queen which is very nearly material parity, however this particular opponent resigns when he looses a pawn or sometimes not even if he is losing a pawn but just doesn't like his position. so faced with the loss of his queen one can understand that the shock could trigger a resignation. please comment, although this isn't a very thorough or detailed annotation I am still interested in what people think or what I may have missed."
