        "1. e4": "This was a blitz game played on Gameknot. White opened with 1.e4 and instead of my favorite response 1... c5 I played 1...e5 which I have been doing more in Blitz to try and enhance my play of double king pawn openings. We went into a Ruy Lopez and White blundered early and resigned after the 8th move. ",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6": "So far simple and on book. ",
        "4. Bxc6": "Less conventional, but we proceed. ",
        "4... dxc6 5. h3": "Slightly taken aback by this move. White wants to prevent the pin, but when he played 4.Bxc6 I thought a grander plan was about to be put into play. ",
        "5... Nf6": "I develop, threaten e4, and wait for either what he has in store or a opportunity for me.",
        "6. d3": "Still waiting...",
        "6... Bc5": "Now if 7. Nxe5  Qd4 and white is in early trouble. ",
        "7. Nxe5": "Missed the threat, and here is the opportunity.",
        "7... Qd4 8. Ng4": "After long consideration. White was destined to lose a knight. ",
        "8... Bxg4": "White Resigns. \nAn early blunder left White in a losing position he did not wish to play out. "
