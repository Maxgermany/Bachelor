        "1. c4": "White opens up with the English Opening \n",
        "1... f5": "The GK database refers to this as the Anglo-Dutch defence \n",
        "2. Nc3": "Knight development, reinforcing the control over d5 \n",
        "2... b6": "?! Black takes a hypermodern approach to the game \n",
        "3. Nf3": "natural... \n",
        "3... Bb7": "again, natural, going through with the fianchetto  \n",
        "4. d4": "Since Black, in the last four moves, has decided against grabbing the centre, White is more than happy to do so himself \n",
        "4... Nf6": "More development, and Black is eyeing the d5 square... \n",
        "5. g3": "looks like White is preparing a fianchetto of his own! \n",
        "5... Bxf3": "?! This doubles the pawns and blocks the h1-a8 diagonal...but the problem is, a) White can unblock the diagonal all too easily and b) exchanging a fianchettoed bishop for a knight may not have been the best course of action \n",
        "6. exf3 d5": "the promised pawn to d5... but I remember thinking at this point that I was already not liking Black's position \n",
        "7. Bf4": "Bishop move....  \n",
        "7... h6": "And Black immediately acts to attack it \n",
        "8. Bd3": "White brings out his other bishop, and threatens the undefended f5 pawn... \n",
        "8... dxc4": "...so Black turns it into an exchange instead \n",
        "9. Bxc4 g5": "following through with his plan, Black drives away the dark-square bishop... \n",
        "10. Be5": "...but White will not be driven away! he now eyes the knight, and the exchange now (BxN, PXB) leaves the king a little too exposed for my liking \n",
        "10... Bg7": "The obvious move (to me, at least) \n",
        "11. f4 Nc6": "Black catches up with development \n",
        "12. fxg5": "?! Not too sure about this move - it allows Black to open up the h-file for the rook \n",
        "12... hxg5 13. a3": "?! I'm going to guess that White didn't really have a plan of action at this point - there isn't really anything wrong with this move though  \n",
        "13... f4": "Hoping for 14.gxf4 gxf4 15.Bxf4 Qxd4 16.Qxd4 Nxd4, relieving a bit of the pressure on Black and putting the knight on a good square \n",
        "14. g4": "Instead, White chooses to close up the queenside pawn structure \n",
        "14... Qd7": "preparing to castle queenside \n",
        "15. f3": "I don't think this move was necessary, since the g-pawn was never threatened, but I guess White wanted to finish the job of closing up the queenside \n",
        "15... Rh3": "?! It's a good idea, I think, but 0-0-0 should have come first... \n",
        "16. Ba6": "! since White prevents it next move! \n",
        "16... e6": "My plan now was to move the king out of the way so that Black could double up on the a-file (it also frees up the f6 knight) However, before I move my king to f7, I wanted to stop any checks from the diagonal (one example would be 16...Kf7 17.Qb3+ e6 18.Bc4 \n",
        "17. Qd3": "Bringing out the queen, while maintaining the defence of the f-pawn. However, the word 'defence' is forgotten entirely by both players when Black plays his next move... \n",
        "17... Nxg4": "??! An extremely dangerous move! Black saw and expected White's next move... \n",
        "18. Qg6+": "! ...and he hoped that he could get in an attack for the lost material. However, there were a couple of things that Black overlooked when playing this; a) Black counted on fxg4, but White had other options at his disposal b) after fxg4, Black planned to play Qd5 (to gain a tempo threatening the h1 rook), but didn't spot the c3 knight until afterwards and c) White's attack had the potential to be a lot stronger than Black had forseen... \n",
        "18... Kd8": "Black rejects Ke7 because of the tempo gained with Qxg7+, and instead moves his king to the right. Black also rejects Kf8 because of 19.Qxg7+ Qxg7 20.Bxg7+ Kxg7 21.fxg4, with not enough firepower to justify the sac \n",
        "19. Bxg7": "!? Talking with another player about this position after the game [under the username 'fiver' - he's the reason I sent bluechimera a challenge, actually :)], he recommended that White play 19.Qxg5+ here, which could have been devastating; 19.Qxh5+! Ke8 20.Qxg4; the rook is forced to retreat and Black has no attack. If Black had simply gone ahead with fxg4, Black would play Bxe5 \n",
        "19... Nxd4": "?! Now 20.Qxg5+ Ke8 21.Qxg4 is met with ...Nf3+, and then maybe - just maybe - Black can get in a powerful attack on the king (maybe, in this position, fxg4 might have been better! as we see in White's next move, that piece was instrumental in blunting White's attack) \n",
        "20. Bf6+": "? I really don't like this move - it lets Black escape with just a -1 material defect. Maybe White forgot about the knight, and only saw a mating attack - 20.Bf6+ Qe7 21.Qg8# \n",
        "20... Nxf6 21. Qxf6+ Ke8 22. O-O-O": "A strange castling situation for White, but logical all the same - threatens the knight and puts the rook on the same file as Black's queen \n",
        "22... Rd8": "the only move to prevent loss of material; I had considered Nb3+, but could not find a sufficient way to carry on the attack \n",
        "23. Qxg5": "Now White takes the g-pawn, though it doesn't have nearly the devastating effect it could have had earlier \n",
        "23... Rxf3": "natural - regaining the lost pawn while defending the hanging one \n",
        "24. Nb5": "?? Ouch! White underestimates the importance of the knight's defence on c3. maybe Rf1 was better here \n",
        "24... Qc6+": "attack! \n",
        "25. Kb1": "This leads to a forced mate, done in style!... but what were the other variations? a) 25.Kd2 Qc2+ 26.Ke1 Qf2# b) [but what if White defends with] 25.Nc3 Rxc3+! [the rook can't be taken because of 26...Qxc3+ 27.Kb1 Qc2+ 28.Ka1 Nb3], then 26.Kd2 Nf3+ 27.Ke2 Qe4+ 28.Kf2 Rc2+ 29.Kf1 Rxd1# c) [and the one to prevent mate] 25.Nc3 Rxc3+! 26.Kb1 Rxa3 [threatens mate; the rook can't be taken for the same reason mentioned before] 27.Rd2 Rxa6 [with a won game for Black] and d).... \n",
        "25... Qc2+ 26. Ka2 Rf2": "! Black threatens mate, and the only way that White can stop it lets Black have another mate \n",
        "27. Rdb1": "now that White's king has been boxed in, Black launches the final assault \n",
        "27... Qb3+ 28. Ka1 Nc2#": "checkmate! as I've said before, my attack was one of extremely high risk, but it's so satisfying when they pay off, isn't it? (a pretty mate as well! :) ) \n"
