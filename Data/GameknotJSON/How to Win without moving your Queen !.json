        "1. Nf3 g6 2. g3 Bg7 3. Bg2 c5 4. e4 Nc6 5. O-O e6 6. d3": "White has adopted a King's Indian Attack system,which he has enjoyed much success with.I have tried different systems against this,and now prefer my fav. Closed Sicilian set-up against it.",
        "6... Nge7 7. Nbd2 O-O 8. Qe2 d6": "It depends on the player and mood,as to which move is used here,either 8...d6 or 8...d5.I prefer ...d6 as this protects the c5 pawn and keeps an eye on e5,while continuing with your plan of pushing the b pawn.",
        "9. c3 b5 10. Nb3 a5 11. a4 b4 12. d4": "Just like my other annotated game 'Dodd,Q vs Jefferies,L',here White plays the move which I'm hoping for(allowing me to attack him on the dark squares).\nEven worse for White here,is that Black now has a good move !",
        "12... Ba6": "! Making good use of the light squares too.",
        "13. c4 cxd4 14. Qd3 d5": "! Piling on the pressure to that c4 pawn.",
        "15. exd5 exd5 16. Nbd2": "White is defending the c4 point,and with the luxury of an extra move,he would love to play 17.b3 here,cementing his position.",
        "16... b3": "!! The best move of the game,and not an easy one to find.Here Black stops White from protecting his c4 pawn,whilst opening up the Queenside for his pieces(well worth a pawn!).",
        "17. Qxb3": "Obviously not 17.Nxb3,as 17...dc would fork Knight and Queen.",
        "17... Rb8 18. Qd1 dxc4": "Re-couping my pawn,and with a very nice position.Those 2 central Black pawns look menacing,whereas White's Queenside pieces are not developed.",
        "19. Re1 Nb4 20. Ne5 Rc8 21. Bf1 d3": "That d3 pawn is like a fishbone in White's throat.Black now has the threat of ...Nc2,forking both Rooks.",
        "22. Re4 Bb7": "White realised that his Rook on e1 looked to be in big trouble,so lashed out in the centre.Now with Black's last move,he has to lose material by force now.",
        "23. Qg4 f5": "White panicked and sent along back-up,in the form of his Queen.Pity this allowed a simple fork with a pawn.",
        "24. Qh4 fxe4 25. Nexc4 Nc2": "Re-routing the Knight to a more aggressive square !",
        "26. Rb1 Nd4 27. Bh3": "?? Crumbling under pressure.Can you spot Black's next move ?",
        "27... Rxc4 28. Nxc4 Nf3+": "White overlooked that his Knight on d2 was overloaded,and needed to protect this vital square on f3.",
        "29. Kf1 Nxh4": "It's strange,that Black has such a good position here,that taking White's Queen wasn't the best move.The move 29...d2!! was even stronger.",
        "30. gxh4 Bd5 31. Ne3 Bb3": "Black's Bishops are starting to take control,hemming in White's pieces.",
        "32. Bd2 Nf5 33. Ke1 Nxe3 34. Bxe3 Bd4": "Here White resigned.In fact it's a forced mate from here.\nBut THE most amazing thing in this game,is that Black NEVER moved his Queen !!"
