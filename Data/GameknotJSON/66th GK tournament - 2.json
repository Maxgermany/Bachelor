        "1. e4": "...this is one of those games that shows a willingness to give up material for development..part of the learning process and on this occasion it worked out ...but its not always the case...\nI took an offbeat approach to the Sicilian and I am getting a lot of interesting positions with it...",
        "1... c5 2. Na3": "What the ..? Yes...Na3 is a slightly differing way to stick it to the book worm early..",
        "2... Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4": "..pure development in mind...both bishops are loose ...",
        "4... e6 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. c4": "..white is ahead on development but grabbing space..",
        "6... Ndb4 7. d5": "..aiming for d6 clamp on the dark bishop..or open up the centre owing to development advantage",

        "16... Qxh2": "..3 pawns up..? Should white panic...?\n\n",
        "17. c5 Qh4+ 18. Kd1 Be7": "..not yet..Ra8 and Bc8 are asleep and need 2-3 moves to have any influence..Rh8 can only challenge Rf1",
        "19. Qc4": "centralise her majesty...",
        "19... Rf8 20. Kc2": "...RxR favours white",

        "28... Qf2 29. cxd6 Qc5+ 30. Kb1": "...wait a second..black is lost..he cant take the pawn..the bishops will pick up the queen by force or mate..eg 30..Qxd6 31. Bg5+ 32.Bg6+ 33. Bh6#",
        "30... Qg1+ 31. Bc1": "..black has to give up the queen to stay in the game !\nMy opponent send a message mocking his queenside development...\n\nSo on this occassion is shows that giving up material for development worked..but I think you need to ensure the tempii you gain is sufficient to seriously wound the opponents position...."
