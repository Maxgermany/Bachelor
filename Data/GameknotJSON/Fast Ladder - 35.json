Oh, let's see, I guess I'll just jab this giant in the ribs with my sharp stick here, ho ho!  Looks like the giant was asleep after all.  Looks like he has +21 armor and +84 dexterity...\n",

The black queen is guarding g4, so pinning the white queen against the d1 rook with black's white bishop is a bigger threat.  To remove the threat against Pc2, Rd2 makes more sense.  Trouble is, black would respond with Nc4.\n\nHow about Qe2?  Bg4 could then be met with Pf3.  Bh3, Pg3 (to avoid QxPg2#--always embarrassing).  Mm, Qe2, of course, sacrifices Pd5.",
