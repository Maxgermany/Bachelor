        "2... d5": "Okay, I have to admit, my opponent wanted the center and probably wanted to play 1...e5 instead of the Carr's Defence.",
        "3. exd5": "By now, I hoped that my opponent would play 3...Nf6 to at least start up some activity in this dull game.",
        "3... h5": "It didn't happen. Instead he/she played a pawn advance, which was illogical in theory.",
        "4. Nc3": "After playing this move, I still hoped for 4...Nf6. Instead, a shocking situation happened; he/she resigned!? I couldn't believe it! There were plenty of moves to play, but instead they had to choose to resign. This was probably the most unreasonable game I have ever played. It's best to avoid doing a strange opening (excluding the Center Game, Englund Gambit, etc.) and know your selected opening well even if you selected a strange opening. Also, the center is open for anyone and everyone should at least take the initiative. However, there are some openings that don't take place in the center, and they should be used cautiously and perhaps sparingly."
