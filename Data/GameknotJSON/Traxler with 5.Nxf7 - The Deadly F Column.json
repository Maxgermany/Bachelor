        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nIt had been a long time since I last played a game with Coach Ion.  The last time I played him I was lucky to get a High Draw against him.  I found out he was playing in the Traxler so I decided to join it!  I am playing him at the moment but, I can report, that I have managed to get my first win of the tournament against a Class C Player with the black pieces.  I ended up investing an enormous amount of material (-9 the equivalent of a whole queen down) but my opponent lost his king so it was worth it.  Gameknot analysis has been requested and you will find the game in my past games profile.\r\n\r\n",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 Bc5": "4. ..... Bc5 - this move is the Traxler Variation of the Two Knights Defense.",
        "5. Nxf7 Bxf2+": "5. ..... Bxf2+ - this piece sac is done to open up the f file for a mating attack.",
        "6. Kf1 Qe7 7. Nxh8": "7. Nxh8 - Knight eats rook and my bishop is en prise.  It looks as if I am hopelessly lost - all is not quite what it seems however.",
        "7... Bb6": "8. ...... Bb6 - recommended move in the World DB.  Preserving Fou Lenoir on that long diagonal attacks the f 2 square.  I just need to do something with my king knight to open up that f column.",
        "8. d3 d5 9. Bxd5 Bg4": "9. ..... Bg4, Fou Leblanc develops with a tempo, clearing the queenside for Henry to castle and attacks the Wicked Witch of the West.",
        "10. Qd2 Nxd5 11. exd5 O-O-O 12. dxc6": "12. dxc6? - tempting to grab the knight but it is not a good move as the WK is now dangerously exposed on that f column.",
        "12... Rf8+ 13. Ke1 Qf6": "13. ..... Qf6 - Glenda now orchestrates a deadly pile up on the f column.",
        "14. cxb7+ Kxb7 15. h3": "15. h3??? - this blunder seals white's fate.  No doubt white intended for Fou Leblanc to be chased off the h5-d1 diagonal, but Glenda has other ideas.  I now announced #3 and my opponent waved the white flag.  Gameknot analysis will give the mating sequence.  I hope you have had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne",
