I figure that at some point white will have to rearrange his pieces in order to attack kingside, or the queenside push will at least divert his attention. White's queen is awkwardly placed, defending the knight, and also lending towards the kingside attack. I hoped the pawns on the queenside don't become a target, but I don't really feel like I had much of a choice either.",
