Rhe1 We are still in opening theory. But Carlsen is thinking here. So perhaps he is trying to recall some special home prep to create chaos since 10...c5 is well known. ",

He is like in an MMA fight and his only objective is to get his opponent on the ground to grind something out, little chance of getting knocked out. \u265f \u2013 at Four Seasons Hotel Even if he can hold on to his title, Carlsen will have big trouble holding on to his #1 ranking long term unless he modifies something. He cannot continue to hope that he can beat others all the time with this style. \u265f ",

Terrible for the fans! So the game had 99% chance of draw, and 1% of Carlsen winning. Is this the best approach for final white game in classical chess? Carlsen thinks so and fans are frustrated. It is clear he wants rapid/blitz playoff. Caruana decided that the easiest way to draw is to give up the c pawn to play out pawn down endgame with Bishops opposite colors. He wants to prove that it would be a draw even with a pawn down."
