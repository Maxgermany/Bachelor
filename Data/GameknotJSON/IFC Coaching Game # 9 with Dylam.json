        "9... Nxd5 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 c6 12. Bxd5": "not so popular, and for a reason. the bishop is much better than the knight. without the bishop it will be harder to pass a4 and to get the queenside advantage. moreover, the knught can be taken any time, what's the rush?",
        "12... cxd5 13. d4": "a must. white has to free his queenside pieces...",
        "13... Bd6": "black plays the regular idea. pressure on the kingside.",
        "14. Re3": "I didn't like that move at the time. it seems to block white's bishop. moreover, the rook has got no aquare to be on the 3rd row due to black bishops.",

        "16... Be4": "there is a lot of pressure on  g2, h3, h2 by black's bishops and queen.",
        "17. Qe2 f5": "with f4 and Rf6-Rg6. white is standing not so good...",
        "18. g3": "???\r\nprevents f4 but what about the h3 pawn?\r\napperantley the way out of this mess was to give the rook on e3:\r\n18. Nd2 f4 19. Nxe4 fxe3 20. Nxd6 exf2  21. Kf1 Qg3 and still in the game.",
