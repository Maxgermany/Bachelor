        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nAfter my 8 rating point loss against John it is nice to get back to winning ways.  I note from Ion's comments about the point distribution between white or black in this mini-tournament.   In my case make that 10 points out of 13 games.  You Steve (untateve) pointed out that the black player often loses his queen.  Well in my case I deliberately walked Glenda into a pin against Henry.  You may think I am off my trolley, indeed I have had a few moments of madness such as taking the black side of a Latvian or a Fried Liver Attack against Coach Ion or the Fried Fox Pork Chop Opening against the Master Mater and paying the ultimate price, but to deliberately walk Glenda into a Royal Pin?  That must take the biscuit!  You will, however, see a method in the madness.  We pick up the action on move 11.",
        "1... c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6 10. Nc3 Na6": "10. ....... Na6 - essential development here, threatens Nb4 and a fork at c2 as well as proceeding to clear those back rank decks.",
        "11. a3 Qf6 12. O-O": "12. 0-0 - prevents Qxf4.",
        "12... h5 13. Be2 Be7 14. Ncxe4": "14. Ncxe4 - taking back with the other knight is better, this allows me to exchange Fou Lenoir for one of those troublesome horsies.",
        "14... Qd4+ 15. Kh1 Bxg5 16. c3": "16. c3 - an interesting intermezzo, attacking Glenda instead of taking on b5.  Now here it comes, this method in the madness.  I now take on e4 knowing that I am putting Glenda in a royal pin.  The thing is, after Glenda disappears off the board I will have traded her in for 3 pieces.  I was two pieces up before the trade so I end up a piece for pawn up in a near endgame against a player with a 1300+ optimum rating.  Now, faced with that situation, given that you do not have a high value piece on the board to watch out for, how many of the jury would want to pass up that opportunity?  Hence, the method in the madness.",
        "16... Qxe4 17. Bf3 Qxf3 18. Rxf3 Bf6": "18. ....... Bf6 - Fou Lenoir gets out of the f4 pawn's attack.  This is a typical near endgame with black having a piece for pawn material advantage.  Such a quiet, peaceful looking position, you would never believe that it had sprung from such a manic opening would you?",
        "19. d3 Rad8 20. Re3 Rhe8": "20. ....... Rhe8 - consolidation by rook centralisation.",
        "21. Bd2 b6 22. g3 Nc7": "22. ..... Nc7 - improves position of queen knight and also provides a defense of e8 supporting major piece exchange on that column.  As I am material up exchanges of the heavies would work greatly in my favour here.",
        "23. Rae1 g6 24. Kg2 g5 25. f5": "25. f5 - euge!  Just what I would lurve, there is bound to be some exchanges on the e column after this move!",
        "25... exf5 26. Kf3 Rxe3+ 27. Rxe3": "27. Rxe3 - rook trade as foreseen.",
        "27... Re8 28. c4 Rxe3+ 29. Bxe3": "29. Bxe3 - off comes the second pair of rooks with me retaining +3 here.  It will soon become +4!",
        "29... Bxb2 30. a4": "30. a4! - Bxg5 loses, loses, loses because I would then play Bxa3 giving me a remote a passer.  I analysed this very carefully and that a pawn passer would become a footman in drag on a1 (you know, black wig, black dress, black cloak, black wand/sceptre, black hat with a gold tiara) but taking on Glenda's powers once in receipt of the wand/sceptre).  My opponent sees this and moves his pawn to a4 - this is gonna make the win a lot harder so I thought.",
        "30... Bf6 31. h3 Ne6": "31. ...... Ne6 - I improve the position of my extra horsie and this will release Fou Lenoir for other duties than defense of the g5 pawn.  What does my opponent do?  Wave the white flag!  Although that does not change my rating it is another win in the bag - all wins are welcome in my book - and nobody can take those 10 mini-tournament points away from me whatever happens.  I hope I can get more than 10 though but I know it will be hard work as I under-estimate nobody, whatever their rating.  I hope you have had a good read and a nice evening.  Bye for now - Joanne"
