        "1. d4 f5": "redfoxrising: We are seeking club input (discussion) of potential moves. \n\nSo it is now my turn in this unrated game, I will take my time to move to allow for club discussion. \n\nI'll add in some candidate moves, We are not concerned about open discussion and there is no need to make this a club consultation match with white and black teams. Please feel free to openly discuss potential moves for both white played by redfoxrising and brigadecommander who is playing black. 2.Bg5 is my attacking plan since her King is exposed! My battery is at 4% so I am going to shut down for now look forward to all suggestions!  nambam: if i was playing white I would play2.Bf4 developing the DSB,them open up the other bishop with 3.e3  archduke_piccolo: My favourite is the standard...\n2.g3. \n\nBut I have no objection to 2.Bg5, 2.Bf4, 2.c4 or 2.Nf3. \nIf we want to go down the wild and woolly 2.e4 (Staunton gambit) track, I don't mind. redfoxrising: I also like the 2.g3 move and the reason is to open up the lsb and gain control of the long diagonal.  jkarp: my vote is also 2.g3 for the reason that ION mentioned. For me, though, what I particularly enjoy is the fact that we're fianchettoing.  \n \n",
        "2. g3": "brigadecommander: I agree\nThe 2.g3 variation is very strong for White..It is more of a positional move then an aggressive move. I play it as white against all 1.d4 openings.I will respond latter tonight.It is 7;40 AM here right now. ",
        "2... Nf6": "redfoxrising: Expected this move anyone feel free for suggestions comments  archduke_piccolo: Popular...\n... and good, here, is 3.Bg2. \n\nHaving played the g-pawn forward to accommodate the bishop, we might as well play it now, and keep our options open in respect of the knights. We establish an immediate presence on the central light squares, which might be worth something if we later place a knight on c3 or a queen on b3. \n\nThere is an alternative that might be worth looking at, and I wouldn't say 'no' to: 3.Nh3. I've not played it before; it is a bit unusual, but develops a knight whilst at the same time keeping the light long diagonal uninterrupted. Against that, though, is that as we would be likely to play Bg2 the move following, and there seems to be nothing against following with 4.Nh3 if we chose, there seems to be no compelling reason to move the knight just yet. \n\nAlso playable are 3.Nf3 - straightforward development - and 3.Bg5. Also possible is 3.c4. That move I have played (by transposition) against strong opposition, for a draw.  brigadecommander: I am relieved that \nyou guys are not playing the Staunton Gambit!! as hinted at by the arch duke. ",
        "3. Bg2": "redfoxrising: I also see no reason not to play 3. Bg2 as that was the plan, and then we can start more development of our minor pieces. The Staunton Gambit is something that I want to play someday.  Black to move..  the-sigularity:3.e6\nopens diagonal for dsb and good for early castle   \n",
        "3... e6": "brigadecommander: Depending on Whites plan,i intend a Dutch stonewall.  archduke_piccolo:  I knew it!\nBlack intends a Stonewall. I seem to recall that it is a bit of a favourite with Janet, and I quite like that defence myself. I near as a toucher mentioned the possibility in an earlier posting, but figured that might not so smart a thing to do. The Stonewall is named for the strong Maginot line of pawns across the central 4 files. But it masks an aggressive intent - more reminiscent of the sobriquet of a certain Confederate general officer... \n\nThree options suggest themselves, here: 4.c4, 4.Nf3, 4.Nh3 \nI'd probably go for the first of these, staking out a share of the centre, but Nf3 does immediately poke at the major weakness in Black's planned opening: e5. \n\nDeveloping the knight at h3 is a far-seeing move, one of whose motivations is to manouevre via f4 to c3, aiming for e5. The other knight would be developed via d2 to f3. The other motivation is an eventual f-pawn advance to f4, to establish a firm control of e5. \n\nHaving said that, the move can wait a move or two (but of course, if Nf3, is no longer an option). refoxrising: On my phone\narchduke Thanks for the in-depth analysis. 4 c4 will be my move I will wait and see her move I think she develop her B \nIn any case I plan Nf3 as suggested ",
        "4. c4 d5": "redfoxrising: I'm considering 5.Qb3 to protect a B check! I encourage anyone to suggest another move but for now I will wait for some input of the other moves you think are better! Even BC might add a comment you never know \nJust a reminder this is a unrated game and its getting interesting nambam:I would still play Bg5.better late than never,and follow with Nb3. it is imperative against this line to get both bishops into the contest as early as possible and to exert pressure on e5 archduke_piccolo:  White's 5th move...\nPlenty of choice here. \n\nOne might try 5.Qb3, to steer the game into uncharted territory, but I think there are better options. I would not worry overmuch about ...Bb4ch, as we can always interpose a bishop and 'ask' (as it were) Black if she really wants to part with her 'good' bishop. \n\nIf we want to move our queen, then what about 5.Qc2, instead? The move covers c4 against capture (unlikely, but possible), but also establishes a presence on the c-file should we decide at some point to take on d5. \n\nAlternatively, we can develop one of the knights. My preference is to finish developing on the K-side - so 5.Nf3 and 5.Nh3. \n\n5,Nf3 looks 'natural', aiming immediately at the 'hole' on e5. We can then castle, and set about mobilising the other wing. The drawback to this is difficulty in bringing the other knight into effective action. That we would have to think about. Having said that, the move is quite sound and solid. \n\n5.Nh3, on the other hand, looks artificial, in complete defiance of the usual guidelines in respect of the centre. But the intent is to bring this knight fairly shortly via f4 to d3; and the Queen's knight develops via d2 to f3. Both would then be focusing upon the e5-square. Quite in keeping with the centralising principle. I like this idea, and it is unclear - given that it involves four further knight moves - whether Black has the means to prevent it. \n\nAs it happens, in the sequence of knight manouevres, it is likely we would want to play Qc2 anyway. If I were voting I would probably opt for one of these two moves: 5.Qc2 or 5.Nh3. For mine, a 50-50 call. ",
        "5. Nh3": "redfoxrising: It was either this move 5. Nh3or Qc2 \nI chose this for development reafons, but also believe Qc2 \nAlso we can castle or play other developing moves. \nWe are working hard against the Stonewall and I feel we can play \nOur game with each move to penetrate the Generals wall \nDefence.  ",
        "5... Be7": "redfoxrising:Move 6 suggestions\n6.Qc2 was on the discussion so that is the question? Are we ready for this Q move or do we have some other suggestions? Off to work I'll check back in later  ",
        "6. O-O": "redfoxrising: move 6 0-0\ndecided to move 6. 0-0 Had thought it over today and feel it is better than Qc2 Black to move archduke_piccolo: Sorry...\n... didn't get back to this in time. Quite happy with 6.0-0, but would also have been OK with 6.Qc2, or 6.Nd2. All are thematic.    \n",
        "6... O-O": "brigadecommander: White has a workable advantage.I knew that going into this variation. Black pins her hopes on the Middle-game. And on building 'Interior lines of comunications'.  archduke_piccolo: Whoa...\nI was about to suggest 7.Nd2 or 7.Qc2, but suddenly they don't look so attractive. Why? My concern is with the possible reply 7...Ne4, after which our plan of establishing our own knights on f3 and d3 don't look so realisable. E.g. 7.Nd2 Ne4 8.Nf3? g5 ... and we are in 'Uh, oh' country. We could delay the knight moves by 8.Qc2, but I think we might fetch up looking for another plan. \n\nThe alternative plan might involve f2-f4 and/or b2-b3, to bring our light-square bishop to a more useful diagonal. \n\nThe moves Nd2 or Qc2 won't hurt us, exactly, but it might be worthwhile looking around for alternatives, or else a plan that will 'go' with these moves. For instance, we might play 7.Qc2 Ne4 8.f3 driving back the knight. The drawback is that f3 would no longer be available to the c2-knight. \n\nBig Think time methinks... \njkarp: What about something like 7.Bg5 In a position like this, where Janet's Nf6, Be7, and Q on the same diagonal, I'd be tempted to try and put pressure on her. Question is how effective is this given her strength? Against your average player, so in 1 or 2 OTB Tournament Games, it was quite effective. And, that was, before I started notating them. nambam: I think our lsb is misplaced personally, should be on e2 in my opinion. it is a bit late now to further develop the dsb. i would now go ahead with Nd2 or perhaps pxp first. we are playing janet's game at the moment archduke_piccolo: Bg2.\nI'm not at all fazed by the location of our DSB. It's fine where it is. \n\nMy thoughts are now on Qc2, Nd2 or b3. At the moment I think I would go with any of these three. Of the last of these my one caveat is: what does it do for us? Relocate the bishop to a better diagonal, or is it simply a better guard over c4 (which, after all, isn't guarded at all right now)? Maybe both? \n\nNote that, after 7.Nd2 Ne4 we really don't want to exchange knights on e4. Further, we will probably want to play 8.Qc2, to ensure c4 is adequately protected. As it turns out, after 7.Qc2 Ne4, we'd likely want to play 8.Nd2. So, in effect, the first two moves of the trio amount pretty much to the same thing. Nor do they rule out b2-b3 shortly thereafter. \n\nSo I reckon I'll be happy enough with Nd2 or Qc2. I won't be hugely sorry, though, if the preference fell on b3.  redfoxrising: still time left to decide\nI think the best moves are Nd2,Qc2, and b3 \nso my decision is to choose 1 of the 3 and and the move order is pretty much interchangeable \n\nI'm going to keep on thinking a little bit in case someone else wishes to add to the discussion.   ",
        "7. b3 c6": "brigadecommander: The Frontier fortifications are Complete. Depending on what White does, Black now has the task of organizing her Interior Lines behind her Central Bulwark. redfoxrising: some moves we have discussed including 8. Nd2,Qc2 of those I favor Nd2 \n\nFor new moves in no particular order 8.e3, Nc3 of these I favor Nc3 \nA new move fianchetto 8.Bb2 \n\nSo to narrow down 8. Bb2 or Nd2 I'm leaning towards 8. Bb2 as the best of these moves. \n\n\nNd2,Bb2,Nc3,e3;Qc2 are the choices please make your selection for move 8. from these or possibly a better suggested move. archduke_piccolo: Now that we have advanced the b-pawn, we might as well fianchetto the bishop. But here's a thing: how about inviting Black to exchange off her dark-square bishop by playing 8.Ba3? That will leave Black's centre a trifle weak on the dark squares. It won't be easy to exploit, of course, without our own DSB, but sure bears thinking about. \n\nAlternatives seem to be 8.Bb2 and 8.Nd2. On the whole I prefer the bishop face-off: 8.Ba3. ",

Of the 4 moves I seem to now like 12. Nf4 but am open to suggestions as at one time I thought I ranked them in my preference of move order, just goes to show you need to look for your best move.

But being a unrated game does allow us to play her with potentially Club members Times X : against just her! So lets keep our advantages as just 1 wrong move we can easily lose it, I'd much more want to keep our slight advantage over her while we can.   brigadecommander: a unrated game\nallows me the Luxury of experimenting with certain Openings. Taking more risks etc. The Dutch Defense has long interested me. I believe it has great potential for improvement. So i learn also from these games.

By sacrificing a knight there, she might create a passed pawn. \n\nShe might also have in mind the kind of switching attention from wing to wing, though in the problem, that is forced upon White, whose path to the ideal squares is a long and narrow one. \n\nWhat I have been looking at are potential breaks for White in the centre, focusing on what e2-e4 might achieve. in the circumstances, that doesn't look easy to arrange, given Black's coverage of that square. And that is why Qe5 has drawn my attention over the last couple of moves or so. At first it looked unpromising, but I'm coming round to thinking that maybe that is where our best chance lies. \n\nSo, my vote is for 29.Qe5. \n\nBut I'm not going to complain if the vote comes down to a different choice, and am willing to be persuaded that a better option exists. nambam: after playing through what i think are all possible moves to break the deadlock, i conclude that i agree with the duke in that our best chance lies with 29. Qe5. it then depends on whether janet wants to swap queens or not. i have played out both scenarios to some lengths,and believe that both give us chances,but will wait to see which way the cat jumps before going into more detail.

It was kinda obvious, but it seemed to me would not have got us anywhere. Sure, we had the twin 'breaks' at b5 and h3 (as I mentioned earlier), but they would have been easily contained, in my view. So, having examined the e3, Be1, exchange bishops sequence, I was inclined to discard it. Perhaps I ought to have mentioned it. \n\nHaving said that, that was merely my opinion. If, having discussed the matter, the others taken the opposing view, I would have gone along with it. After all, it could scarcely have lost us the game. \n\nAs it happens, I am pleased Janet accepted the exchange of Queens. I was more than half expecting her to decline. The reasons will emerge, I think, over the next few moves. \n\nAt this point, I quite like 31.e4, as redfox recommends.  nambam: i agree. i am somewhat surprised janet exchanged. now that she has i think e4 is the obvious move.  brigadecommander: I anticipate and welcome\ne4.

Bf1 is the best try i think, but i am not too confident. i dont think H3 will work and anything else is irrelevant or could lose redfoxrising: thanks nambam\nMorgan has suggested Bf1 it's still early and we have to here from duke or jk or anyone else who might want to get involved. If Bf1 is played what might be her reaction? \n\nRd2 was a move I left out with intention of getting to Rf2+ \n\nBf1 first ,She's not opening the center and taking our R on e4 but if we play Bf1 it would be hanging ? so move order seems something we need to discuss \n\n\nSo now that I look at this closer maybe Rd2 might be our best move.

Of course, I don't compare chess to war as others do. Instead, I compare it to yoga, so keeping the breathes involved compared with our R being attacked, I'd try to settle it with 33.Rf1, and after black gets out, I'd go ahead with 34.Rf4 as my idea would be to simply double up on one file and try to create problems for black.
