    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+ Bd7 4. Qe2 Nc6": "We started off with the Sicilian, Canl-Sokolsky attack.",
        "5. c3 Nf6 6. d4 cxd4 7. cxd4 a6": "8. d5 could have been bad for black, so I decided to force white to choose.",
        "8. Ba4 b5": "Trying to alleviate the threat on the diagonal and advance my position.",
        "9. Bb3 Bg4": "Idea here is to capture d4, or if white moves her queen to d1, d2, or d3, capture the knight so white would have a hard time castling kingside after gxf3.  White would have the choice of either capturing with the pawn, or losing the d4 pawn.",
        "10. Qd3 Bxf3 11. gxf3": "This is what black was hoping for, although white can still use this to her advantage.",
        "11... e5": "I'm planning on posting my knight on d4 then attacking queenside with my rook.",
        "12. d5 Nd4 13. Bd1 Rc8 14. Nc3": "A good defense that will last a while.",
        "14... Qa5 15. Bd2 Qb4": "This weakens white's knight but it puts my queen in danger.",
        "16. b3 Qc5 17. Rc1": "White's pieces are moving quite well together, although white is out of position.",
        "17... Qb6 18. O-O": "At this time, I felt it a good idea to work on the kingside, although white's pawns are in good positions (other than her doubled pawns on f2 and f3).",
        "18... Be7 19. Be3": "This move puts my knight on d4 in jeopardy.  For when white moves f4, my knight is only defended by my queen if I capture f4.  Hopefully I can maneuver a pawn to g5 before it gets too bad.  (This was my thinking at the time.  However, I can now see that black will inevitably be down 1 point after the exchange).",
        "19... O-O 20. Kh1 h6 21. f4": "I was too late, but there is still hope.  I don't have to capture f4.",
        "21... Kh7": "Here white probably has an idea of moving her rook to g1, then following up with her pawn on f5 threatening an unprotected h6 pawn.  I preemptively move my king with an idea of g6, threatening white's pawn on f5, (when moved).",
        "22. f5 g6 23. Ne2": "Now black's knight is in big trouble.  White may be up 1 point after the exchange.  I will stall white and try to gain position by capturing white's rook.",
        "23... Rxc1 24. Nxc1 Kg7": "I don't want to be in the line of fire of white's queen after an exchange of pawns.  Perhaps it was too early to make this move, (if i should have made it at all).",
        "25. Ne2": "Here it is.  I will simply need to refocus my efforts and gain position.  I see a potential opening on the first rank.",
        "25... Qa5 26. Nxd4 exd4 27. Bxd4 g5": "I am now down a point, and need to strengthen my defense.  I am worried about the d5 pawn, but I think I can overcome it.",
        "28. Qc2 Qb4 29. Bb2": "A safe move, and I am a little worried about e5.",
        "29... Kg8": "I am moving my king again to unpin my bishop and put pressure on e4, with the idea of Nh5.",
        "30. f3 Nh5": "My idea here is to move my bishop to f6 to challenge white's firm grasp on the long diagonal.  If white moves her pawn to f4, I will simply capture it.",
        "31. f4": "There it is.",
        "31... Nxf4 32. Rxf4": "I did not see this move coming.  Perhaps white saw something black did not see.",
        "32... gxf4 33. Qg2+ Bg5": "Anything else would have resulted in a checkmate.  However, this position, (as delicate as it is), gives black the momentum he needs.",
        "34. Be2": "A smart move, as I was looking for a captured bishop or exchange of queens.",
        "34... Qe1+ 35. Bf1 Rc8": "My idea here it to move my rook to c2.  If white captures my rook with her queen, I will checkmate her with Qxf1#.  This move also grabs hold of the c-file - a very important file in this game.",
        "36. Kg1": "Of course, now that idea won't work.",
        "36... Kh7": "I think it's time to unpin my bishop.  It could be useful here.  (Although an immediate move by my bishop will still result in a checkmate).  ",
        "37. h3 Qe3+": "The idea here is to move my pawn forward into a mating attack.",
        "38. Kh1 f3 39. Qg3 Qxe4": "White's position is now lost, as anything white does will result in either a loss of her queen, a checkmate, or both.  A good game."
