        "1. e4 c6 2. Nc3 d5": "Experimenting with the Caro-Kann.  Sometimes it results in passive but solid positions; other times the games are relatively open.",
        "3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 Nf6 5. Bg5 e6 6. Qe2 Be7": "During the game, I assumed 0-0-0 was coming after Qe2.  Now during the replay, I wonder if the intent was to play Nxd5, thinking I couldn't recapture.  But of course Black can recapture.",
        "7. Qb5+": "I thought this needless exposed the Q to later attack.  In other words, Black just gains tempos.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nf3 O-O 9. a3": "While a3 prevents the annoying Nb4, it also costs another tempo.",
        "9... a6": "a6 gains a tempo and White has to move a piece a second time.",
        "10. Qd3 h6 11. Bd2 Qc7 12. Be2 b5 13. b4 Bxb4 14. O-O": "If axb4, Black can play Nxb4, hitting the Q.  When the Q moves, Black can play Nxc2+, netting a third pawn and the exchange--and preventing White from castling.  There is no square the Q can move to that will cover c2.",
        "14... Bd6": "So Black is able to sneak a pawn.",
        "15. Na2 Bd7": "Both sides are now completely developed, but Black is a pawn to the good.",
        "16. Nh4": "I don't understand the intent of this move, but it hangs another pawn.",
        "16... Bxh2+ 17. Kh1 Bf4": "Black is content to exchange Bs and reduce the threat of any future attack.",
        "18. Bxf4 Qxf4 19. Nf3 Qe4 20. c3 Rfc8 21. Nd2 Qxd3 22. Bxd3": "With the exchange of Qs, White's attacking prospects are severely limited.  Black has a two-pawn advantage to work with.  However, Black's B is a lousy piece.  It needs to be improved.",
        "22... Na5 23. Rac1 Nc4 24. Nxc4 dxc4": "Not sure if this was the best way to recapture, but now the Black B has a better diagonal and d5 might be a good square for the N later.",
        "25. Be2 Bc6 26. f3 a5 27. Rc2 Nd5 28. Re1": "If the R doesn't vacate f1, Ne3 would really hurt.",
        "28... Rab8 29. Bd1 Bd7 30. Rb2 Rce8": "Where and how can Black break in the center?  It needs to happen for Black to exploit the extra material.",
        "31. Bc2 g6 32. Be4 Nf6": "Allowing White to capture would leave a very weak pawn on d5.  Already I am not happy about my target on b5.",
        "33. g4 Kg7 34. Rg1": "I don't understand this R move.  Now White will be saddled with a target on g4.",
        "34... Nxe4 35. fxe4 Bc6 36. Re2 f5 37. gxf5": "I was expecting d5 here, which would make my job considerably tougher.",
        "37... exf5 38. d5": "I think White may have missed the point that at the end of the sequence the Re2 is unprotected.",
        "38... Bxd5 39. Kh2": "Now White sees the problem, but Black has managed to sneak another pawn.",
        "39... Rxe4 40. Rxe4 Bxe4": "Black now has a four pawn edge and a good B.  The Kingside pawns are also mobile.",
        "41. Nc1": "I was expecting Rd1, trying to fight for the open file.  Black's best after that might be Bd3.",
        "41... Rd8": "Now I've got the open file as well.",
        "42. Ne2": "I think White overlooked the pin on a light square.  But that's why the open file is important--it gives the R mobility to create threats.",
        "42... Rd2": "Ouch.",
        "43. Re1": "Forced.",
        "43... Bd3": "Black can put two attackers on the piece, while White can only muster one defender.  The White K is too far away to help immediately.  Faced with the loss of another piece, White resigned here.\n\nAlthough the result was good, looking back it was probably not a good idea to trade my good dark-square B.  I was so focused on potential attacking possibilities for White down the open h-file or against my K that I played too defensively.  I also didn't like the way b5 got turned into a target.  I thought White could have caused more trouble for that backward pawn.  I was glad that I was able to take advantage of White's mistakes, but feel I made too many of my own."
