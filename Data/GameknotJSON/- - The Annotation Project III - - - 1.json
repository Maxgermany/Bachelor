        "1. e4": "In the second Annotation Project Steve took maximum points from me. Up to this point in this tournament most of my games had been with the black pieces and I was struggling for points. To me, it started to feel black was as good as lost before a move was made. Now was a chance to try and prove it!",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+": "The first non-forced move, but still the only move to gain some compensation for the queen.",
        "7... Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4": "White can't afford not to take the knight.",
        "9... Qe8 10. Ne6+": "It seems that a key factor is the white knight occupying this square before the e7 pawn gets a chance to move, thus restricting the bishop and queen and gaining a tempo.",
        "10... Kb6 11. d3": "A favoured move of mine in the last tournament which seemed to serve me well so with the black king even more restricted this time by the c6 pawn, surely this can only make the position even better for me. This opens a line for the black bishop to deliver a check. It is important for white to develop quickly, whilst keeping pressure on the king at the same time.\r\n",
        "11... c5": "preventing the bishop check, opening a diagonal for the queen, and giving the knight another option.\r\n",
        "12. Na3": "I need to develop the knight. Usually a knight on the edge is bad, but I am looking at the possibility of c4+ which brings the knight back to a more central position.",
        "12... a6": "Presumably preparing a route for the king to escape to the back row. I would much rather he stayed out in the open.",
        "13. Be3": "Developing another piece eyeing the king and his new escape square. To defend the pawn effectively, black will need to restrict his queen again.",
        "13... Nd7": "This defence does release the rook though.",
        "14. b4": "More pressure on the pawn",
        "14... Rc8": "This seems the most natural response. I can't bring any more pieces to bear on that pawn, but mine are slowly becoming more active whereas blacks are still very restricted.",
        "15. Rb1": "Time to bring a rook into the action. The b-file will become half open soon, so this rook move adds a bit more pressure.",
        "15... Ka7": "Moving away from the danger area, and the threat of bxe which would have all but forced the king to c6, further restricting black's rook and queen.",
        "16. bxc5": "Finally winning the pawn, but more importantly clearing the b file, advancing my own pawn, and threatening a discovered check.",
        "16... Rc6": "This move was expected, and effectively blocks the threats. It does keep the queen nicely out of the way though.\r\n",
        "17. O-O": "I felt before this move that I was in good shape, with the position nicely contained. Problem is, how do I proceed? Almost certain I would need both rooks if I was to convert this position into a full point, it made sense to get my own king to safety. It was nice to have the luxury of a bit of time, and I wanted to see how black would proceed.",
        "17... Nf6": "Black sees a way of getting his knight into a more active role by first attacking one bishop...",
        "18. Bh3": "which I can't afford to lose, and must stay on that diagonal to defend my knight...",
        "18... Nd5": "And then my other bishop...",
        "19. Bd4": "which I am not prepared to remove from that diagonal where it is a constant threat to the king.",
        "19... e3": "Unfortunately these two aggressive knight moves allow black to create a passed pawn. This is a serious potential threat, but as yet he can't provide backup for it advance any further.",
        "20. c4": "so time to kick the defender back out",
        "20... Nc7": "where I am happy to swap with my own knight as I soon want to release my bishop from defensive duty.",
        "21. Nxc7 Rxc7 22. g3": "to bring my bishop back to the long diagonal for further pressure on the b pawn.",
        "22... e5": "After this move I started to wonder if I had let a good position slip away from me as black had effectively broken out with a bishop and queen, with multiple threats at the same time.",
        "23. fxe5 Bxc5 24. Bxc5+": "Leaving me no choice but to swap bishops due to the threat of e2+",
        "24... Rxc5 25. d4": "I still have 2 connected passed pawns which black can't completely ignore, as well as my earlier ideas involving his b7 pawn.",
        "25... Ra5": "Expected, threatening the knight and forcing it back",
        "26. Bg2": "but my knight is going no-where thank you ;) I feel Steeve will fancy his chances here, whilst I am probably fighting for a draw. If he thinks he can win, he won't take the knight as I could choose to either force a draw or win material with Rxb7+, so for one move at least my knight is safe whilst I get my bishop where I want it.",
        "26... b6 27. Nc2": "Now the knight has to move, but at least it was on my terms.",
        "27... e2": "Had to come sometime, but it still has no backup. He can defend it with Qh5, but he can't advance it any further.",
        "28. Rfe1 Rxa2": "'Winning' a pawn, and presumably looking to prevent me taking his as this would pin my knight. We both agreeed afterwards that this was in fact the game losing move, although the GK analysis only says it was a mistake. In fact it started a series of knight moves which completely changed the game, although at this point I still thought I may be lucky to get the draw.",
        "29. Nb4": "Innocently attacking the rook, but with more sinister motives in mind...",
        "29... Rd2": "Possibly the best option - if he's going to attack my pawn formation, may as well go for the centre one.",
        "30. Nc6+": "A nice check move, giving me a discovered check afterwards. I have often thought with knights, it's not about where they can get to next move, but where they can get to, and how many options of squares they can cover 2 or 3 moves later.",
        "30... Kb7 31. Ne7+ Kb8 32. Rxb6+": "Suddenly the kings defences are all but gone, and he has three enemy pieces on him.",
        "32... Ka7 33. Rb7+ Ka8": "How to finish it? Plenty of pressure but where is the win? I looked long and hard at this, but was too focused on keeping the rook on the b file in order to keep the king restricted to a7, but how to gain a move to deliver mate on a7? I was almost ready to offer the draw, when it dawned on me that if a rook on the 2nd file keeps the king on the first, then likewise a rook on the seventh row keeps the king on the 8th. The important difference is, I can actually attack the 8th with that last rook I knew I would need back at move 17.\r\nThanks for the game Steve.",
