        "1. e4 c5": "54th GK Tournament game, I choose the Sicilian.",
        "2. Bc4 e6": "The Philidor Variation, characterized by White's 2. Bc4.",
        "3. a3 Nc6": "I'm not sue what was gained by 3. a3, unless white was planning b4 (never played) or really early in anticipating that I might move a knight there.",
        "4. c3 Nf6 5. d3 d5": "Seems like a good time to strike at the center.",
        "6. exd5 exd5 7. Ba2 Bd6": "Ready to castle. Black has a strong center and 3 pieces developed to white's 1, and I'm not sure that a2 is an ideal place for a bishop. Maybe white will soon lament his loss of tempi and the fact that so many of his pieces are still on their starting squares.",
        "8. Qf3 Qe7+": "White goes after a pawn, so I go after a king.",
        "9. Qe3 Ne5": "Not quite ready to exchange the royal ladies. I might yet find a use for her.",
        "10. Ne2 Nfg4": "Now, this looks promising. Careless play here by white could cost him his queen, such as by 11. Qg3 Ng6 12. Qf3 Nh4 13. Qh3 Nxf2.",
        "11. Qd2 Bf5": "Adding pieces to the fray, threatening the pawn at d3.",
        "12. Bxd5 Nxd3+": "White pounced on the defenseless d5 pawn, but I'm not sure he had much else. If 12. O-0 then Nf3 , 13. gxf3 Qh4 is fairly decisive, though white can sacrifice his queen on f4 to prevent immediate checkmate.",
        "13. Kf1 Ngxf2": "Now the white rook falls. 14. Rg1 is met by 14. ... Bxh2",
        "14. Bc4 Nxh1": "I cannot seem to find a sure win in this position, but I can win the exchange, liquidate a little, and clear away some kingside pawns, virtually ensuring an easy endgame.",
        "15. Bxd3 Bxd3 16. Qxd3 Qf6+": "Keeping up the pressure, and hunting those kingside pawns.",
        "17. Ke1 Qf2+": "White could not have played 17. Kg1?? to hunt the trapped black knight, for 17. ... Qf2 , 18. Kxh1 Qf1 , 19. Ng1 Qxd3 is decisive.",
        "18. Kd1 Qxg2": "Just munching pawns, building the material and positional advantage. White cannot take the undefended bishop with 19. Qxd3 because 19. ... Rd1 wins the white queen (rook bishop for queen isn't much of a win, but it's sufficient to ensure the bishop's safety). At this point, I really expected white to put me in check with 19. Qe3  to which I didn't have any clever replies - just consolidating my forces and eventually bringing my rooks to bear on the open center and exposed white king.",
        "19. Nd2 Nf2+": "19. Nd2?? was ostensibly an attempt to bring some of the underdeveloped white pieces into play, but after black's reply, white is royally forked and resigns immediately."
