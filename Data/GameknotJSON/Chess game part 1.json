        "1. d4 d5 2. c4": "The Queen's Gambit: the opening that I always (and will almost always) play.",
        "2... dxc4": "He accepted it.",
        "3. e4": "This move takes control of the center and attacks the c-4 pawn.",
        "3... Nf6": "This move attacks the center and develops the knight...",
        "4. Nc3": "...but I defend and develop my knight.",
        "4... c6": "This move is common in the Queen's Gambit Declined.  It's supposed to defend the d-5 pawn in that opening, but I guess it still builds pressure on the square d-5.",
        "5. Bxc4": "I take the pawn back before Black can save it.",
        "5... e6 6. Bf4 Bb4 7. Nf3": "?  This mistake was because I got hung up on development.  Now Black can take advantage of the pin.",
        "7... Nxe4": "Now I'm down a pawn, but I still have good fighting chances.",
        "8. Qd3": "This is the decisive move that I made when I recalled from the book \"Winning Chess Strategies\"... \"If I don't find a way to break through and wipe Black out, that lost pawn will come back to haunt me.  In other words, I must attack!\"  Well, I have a considerable lead in development, so I harass Black's kingside!  Of course, this is a totally normal move.",
        "8... Nxc3 9. bxc3 Ba5": "If my queen leaves the c-pawn unprotected, Black will win with a fork.  I must be cautious.",
        "10. Ng5": "The first sign of attack.  This is not actually a threat because of the fork I mentioned earlier.",
        "10... Qf6": "In this case, the best way to defend is to develop your pieces.  I prefer developing the minor pieces first.",
        "11. g3 g6": "? This is a mistake that lets me skewer the queen and the rook.",
        "12. Be5": "Skewer=roasting pieces!",
        "12... Qxg5": "Takes the knight...",
        "13. Bxh8": "..and takes the rook.",
        "13... b5 14. Bb3 Bb7 15. Be5 Nd7 16. Bf4 Qf5": "Forcing a transition into the endgame so quickly.",
        "17. Ke2": "The best.  After 17... Qxd3+ 18.Kxd3 Black can equalize with 18... c5 19. Rc1 c4+ 20. Bxc4 bxc4+ 21. Kxc4 Rc8+ 22. Kd3, but I hope he doesn't see it.  Otherwise, I'm slightly better: both players have the bishop pair, I'm slightly ahead in material (+1), and I should be able to trade off pawns.  On the other hand, Black has less pawn islands to defend (3 against 2) and he has a little more space."
