        "1. e4": "This is annotated at the request of knight_nite.",
        "1... e6": "My opponent plays the French Defence",
        "2. d4 d5 3. Nc3": "We play the main line.",
        "3... dxe4": "This is slightly passive - the impression I get is black is playing for a draw.",
        "4. Nxe4": "I take back.",
        "4... Bd7": "He develops.",
        "5. Nf3": "So do I, protecting d4.",
        "5... Bc6": "He hits e4.",
        "6. Bd3": "I protect.",
        "6... Nf6": "He hits again.",
        "7. Ng3": "I retreat.",
        "7... Nbd7": "Natural development.",
        "8. O-O": "I castle.",
        "8... Be7": "He prepares to castle.",
        "9. Re1": "I take control of the semi-open e file.",
        "9... Bxf3": "He takes.",
        "10. Qxf3": "I take back.",
        "10... c6": "He prevents me from playing Qf3xb7.",
        "11. Bf4": "I develop my bishop.",
        "11... O-O": "He finally castles.",
        "12. c4": "I decide to seize some space.",
        "12... Qb6": "Forking pawns at d4 and b2. I found out afterwards that we had been following eleu (1906) vs. orlink (2175). The Gameknot computer likes 13. c5 here. I decided on something else.",
        "13. Ne2": "I thought with this move I was protecting b2, because of if 13.... Qxb2 14. Re-b1 Qa3 15. Bxh7+ followed by 16. Qxa3. It was shortly after I played this I realized that 15. Bxh7+ would be a mistake as the black queen is protected on a3 by his bishop on e7.",
        "13... a5": "A good move, securing space on the queen-side.",
        "14. b3": "I had seen that in fact black could have taken on b2, so I protected the b pawn by moving it.",
        "14... Rfd8": "He develops.",
        "15. c5": "I think this is a mistake, and later in the game my d pawn is weak, and in fact I even lose it for no compensation. It leaves d5 as a lovely square for his pieces. I was hoping to get a piece onto d6, but I never manage this.",
        "15... Qa7": "This move was forced.",
        "16. Nc3": "Preparing to exchange pieces on d5 if necssary.",
        "16... Bf8": "Not quite sure why he played this.",
        "17. Bg5": "So I seek to take advantage of Bf8 by pinning his knight.",
        "17... h6": "He hits my bishop.",
        "18. Bh4": "The bishop comes back.",
        "18... Be7": "And he sort of admits his mistake of Bf8.",
        "19. Bc4": "With ideas of exchanging on d5 if necessary, and also maybe sacrificing on e6 in the right conditions.",
        "19... b5": "This is a good move, gaining space on the queen-side, allowing his queen to get back into the game along the second rank and attacking my bishop. I could of course have taken the pawn en passant here. After 20.\tcxb6 e.p. Nxb6 21. Qxc6 he can capture my d pawn, so I don't gain a pawn, so after a lot of thought I decided to retreat my bishop.",
        "20. Bd3": "I am now attacking c6 with the queen.",
        "20... Nf8": "This opens up a counter-attack on d4.",
        "21. Rad1": "And this indirectly protects d4, so I am threatening 22. Qxc6 and if Rxd4 I have Bxh7+ winning the exchange (bishop for rook).",
        "21... Qd7": "But he sees this and defends accurately.",
        "22. Qe2": "I think I had dreams of playing f2-f4-f5 here.",
        "22... a4": "He seeks to open a file on the queen-side.",
        "23. b4": "I refuse.",
        "23... Ra7": "He is planning Nd5 and if I take Nxd5 then he plays Bxh4. He can't do it immediately, as I could reply with Nb6 forking his queen and rook and winning the exchange (rook for knight). So he prepares it.",
        "24. Kh1": "I move my king to a safer square.",
        "24... Nd5": "And he starts to simplify.",
        "25. Nxd5": "So I take.",
        "25... Bxh4": "He takes back.",
        "26. Nb6": "I hit his queen.",
        "26... Qe7": "Queen moves.",
        "27. Be4": "I hit c6.",
        "27... Rc7": "He protects.",
        "28. Qf3": "I attack c6 again. I was expecting 28.......Qe8 and then I think 29. d4-d5! is very strong, taking advantage of his queen and my rook being on the same file, for instance 29......exd5? loses the queen to Bh7+.",
        "28... Qf6": "But this is a superb defence I hadn't seen.",
        "29. g3": "So I hit his bishop.",
        "29... Qxf3+": "He wisely takes the queens off.",
        "30. Bxf3": "I take back.",
        "30... Bf6": "Bishop drops back.",
        "31. Re4": "I protect d4. He can't play e6-e5, exploiting the pin on the d file as my rook on d1 is protected by the Bf3.",
        "31... Ng6": "But there is no hurry. That d pawn is a goner anyway.",
        "32. Kg2": "So I bring my king back into the game.",
        "32... Ne7": "He continues his knight movements.",
        "33. Kf1": "I continue with my king re-positioning.",
        "33... Kf8": "He decides to move his.",
        "34. g4": "I decide to prevent Nf5 which would win my d pawn.",
        "34... g5": "He now prepares to maneuver his knight to g6 and f4. ",
        "35. Ke2": "Continuing to centralize my king.",
        "35... Ng6": "He continues with his plan.",
        "36. Ke3": "Played to protect d4, but I think this is a blunder, for reasons we shall see. I think I need to get my king to c3 to protect the d pawn. However I can't move Kd3 because then e6-e5 wins a pawn for him. So I think my best move was Rd2 followed by Kd1-c2-c3.",
        "36... Nf4": "His knight comes in.",
        "37. a3": "I stabilize the position of the queen-side pawns.",
        "37... Bg7": "But help! He is threatening f7-f5 winning my rook on e4.",
        "38. Kd2": "So I have to give it a flight square, in the process giving up the d pawn.",
        "38... Bxd4": "So he takes.",
        "39. Kc2": "I threaten his bishop.",
        "39... Bf6": "The bishop retreats. I think this is a mistake and simply e6-e5 leaves him a clear pawn up.",
        "40. Rxd8+": "I take.",
        "40... Bxd8": "He takes back.",
        "41. h4": "I rush to exchange pawns, being a pawn down now.",
        "41... Ng6": "This is a blunder too. The knight is needed on f4 in order to block the d file on d5.",
        "42. hxg5": "I exchange. The immediate Rd4 may also be good.",
        "42... hxg5": "I think it is better to take back with his bishop as now I take control of the d file with tempo.",
        "43. Rd4": "Like this.",
        "43... Bf6": "He hits my rook.",
        "44. Rd7": "I prepare to exchange rooks. ",
        "44... Rxd7": "He takes.",
        "45. Nxd7+": "I take back with check. In this calculations, when deciding his moves earlier, he didn't realize that this was check and he was planning to play Bd4 attacking f2. However, even with, say his king on g8 I think I would have an advantage, as his queen-side pawns are dropping.",
        "45... Ke7": "So he has to move his king.",
        "46. Nxf6": "In these positions, with pawns on both sides of the board, the bishops are much stronger than the knights, so I exchange.",
        "46... Kxf6": "He takes back.",
        "47. Bxc6": "I have not only gained my pawn back, but this is easily won for me, as his queen-side pawns are weak, and my bishop is so much better than his knight.",
        "47... Ne5": "He forks my bishop and pawn.",
        "48. Bxb5": "I take. He can't recapture on g4 as after c5-c6 he can't stop my c pawn. ",
        "48... Ke7": "So his king comes back.",
        "49. Be2": "And I protect g4. I am a clear pawn up now.",
        "49... Kd7": "His king comes over.",
        "50. Kc3": "My king goes up.",
        "50... Kc6": "His king comes up.",
        "51. Kd4": "My king advances again.",
        "51... Ng6": "Knight retreats.",
        "52. b5+": "I check his king.",
        "52... Kc7": "King retreats.",
        "53. b6+": "King is checked again.",
        "53... Kb8": "King retreats.",
        "54. c6": "I advance.",
        "54... Ne7": "Knight attacks pawn.",
        "55. Kc5": "King protects.",
        "55... Nd5": "Knight takes up central post.",
        "56. Bb5": "I threaten to take another pawn.",
        "56... Nc3": "I don't think there is anything better, black is simply lost here.",
        "57. c7+": "And black resigns. Many thanks for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate it on the star system, to let me know how I am doing. It was a long game, and I annotated it in two parts!"
