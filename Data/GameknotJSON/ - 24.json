        "1. e4 Nf6": "Alekhine Defence..it's far more fun to play than most chess openings .\r\nit's also much underestimated opening .\r\nMy openent is a good player , i played him twice till now and both games are very nice.",
        "2. e5 Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 d6 5. f4": "so its the four pawns attack !\r\nmost players try to avoid it maybe because its the most analysed line in Alekhine defence .\r\nbut i think its very intersiting for both sides.",
        "5... dxe5 6. fxe5 Nc6": "here 6.... c5 is an alternative\r\nyes its strange , black is forcing white to advance his center pawns !!!!\r\nwhich is usually what white wants to do .\r\nThe idea is simple : destroy the pawns !!!????\r\nfor example \r\n           7.d5      e6\r\n          8. Nc3    ed\r\n          9. cd      c4\r\nand there are many games and variations from this point played by top GMs\r\nback to the game 6....  Nc6 is the normal move   ",
        "7. Nf3 Bf5": "Alternative and most comon is 7....   Bg4",
        "8. Nc3 e6 9. a3": "9.Be3 is the most played move ( of course developing the bishop and defending the  d4 pawn), and should be the best.\r\nnothing is wrong with 9.a3 ( preventing knight or bishop to go to b4 square, also in mind  b4  in future . ",
        "9... Bg4": "9. ...    Qd7  was played before and gave black a nice position to play even though black lost.\r\nthe move in the game is in my notebook where i believe is the best here keeping the presure on the d4 pawn and open all posbilities .",
        "10. Be3": "defending the d4 pawn .\r\nso what to choose ? \r\n10....  Be7\r\n10....  Qd7\r\n10....  Bf3\r\nI analysed the three moves  and think that 10. Bf3 give my openent some  weakneses in the king side which i prefer .",
        "10... Bxf3 11. gxf3": "  11.Qf3   then 11....   Nd4  12.Qe4  Nc6  white had some compinsation for the pawn but is it enough ... its not clear for me till now..even the e5 pawn might fall .\r\nback to the game \r\nIts very hard to decide what to do here ?,  and what move  is better ? .\r\nmany good moves\r\naccording to my notes its  11....Qh4 ( the move in the game )\r\nbut 11.... Be7 is good too , also the old   11....  Qd7  is playable here .\r\nso i  continue according to my note ",
        "11... Qh4+ 12. Bf2": "other moves are bad\r\n12. Kd2  o-o-o\r\n12. Ke2  Nc4",
        "12... Qf4": "As you can see too many choices i had,  and its not easy to decide where the queen should go.  But i have to make a move any way\r\nEven white's position is ok but he should work hard to find the best move .\r\nI was tring hard to find what should white do here , i think white should try to exchange queens in some way as black queen is annoying white .\r\ni had now some analysis for this position , i will not write it cuz its too many but its strange :\r\nMy queen is out early and looks  alone but its very strong\r\n\r\n",
        "13. Nb5": "so kevin played  13. Nb5 ?\r\ni think he is waisting his time with this move , and clearly he got    NO PLAN .\r\nHe should try some thing else \r\n13.Qc1\r\ni even think   13.Ne2 is not bad as 13.Nb5\r\n\r\n13.Ne2  Qf3   14.Ng3   and Bg2  or 14.Rg1  0-0-0   15.Bg2 with good compensation for the pawn .\r\nWith the move in the game , there is no threat nor devolopment  and not even defending the pawn .\r\n\r\nu can notice the weekneses white should keep an eye on them, (  c4 , d4 , f3 , and the king )\r\n",
        "13... O-O-O": "of course !!\r\nJust push the pawn a6\r\nand get the delecios d pawn\r\nAlso  Ne5 is threatened after a6\r\n",
        "14. Bg3": "there are other moves like\r\n14.Qc1 ( nice variation )\r\n 14....Qf3  15.Rg1  Qe4   16. Be2  Rd4   17.Nd4  Nd4  18. Bd4  Qd4  19.kf1  Qe5  with knight and three paws for the rook  good enough  but still needs alot to win .\r\n14.Rg1  Ne5 ! (white can't take on a7 cuz of Kb8 threatneing both a7 knight and Nf3 )  15.Be2 a6   or 15....   Nc6\r\n14.Be2  a6    15.Nc3  Nd4\r\n\r\nBut any way 14.Bg3 is ok \r\n",
        "14... Qe3+": "This is a very critical moment in the game also the same old question  : where to go with the queen ?\r\n\r\nif  14....  Qg5  then  15.f4 !   and no more threats from my qeen and even the queen will be in bad squares.\r\n\r\nif 14... Qh6  15.Qc1  Qc1   16.Rc1  Nd4   17.Nd4  Rd4  just better ending ( pawn more ) but two beshops with my openent .\r\n\r\nso i prefer to annoy my openent more with my lonely qeen\r\n\r\n",
        "15. Be2": "15.Qe2  Nc4   ",
        "15... a6": "ok  time for the d4 pawn",
        "16. Bf2": "nice move .....  but cant defend the pawn!!",
        "16... Qh6 17. Nc3 Nxd4": "surprise !!!\r\nthere a check by the queen on h4 ",
        "18. Bxd4 Qh4+": "cant go back with the bishop cuz queen is pinned !!\r\nbut the thing i did not noticed that 19.Bf2 is threatening my queen .\r\nbut  thanks god i take 19.Rd1   with check .\r\n\r\nIs it better to go back with the bishop...giving the queen  for rook and bishop and a pawn less ........maybe ?!\r\n\r\n",
        "19. Kf1 Rxd4": "sure ...\r\nIs it only a pawn ?.....after all this struggle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nnot really white position is bad",
        "20. Qe1 Qh3+ 21. Kg1": "ok this is the worst move in the game  :(\r\nand i'm really sad for that !\r\n21.kf2   is better \r\n21....   Nc4",
        "21... Bc5": "it's over\r\nvery nice game , iam proud of it \r\nmy openent is a strong player and u cant sleep amoment with him .\r\n"
