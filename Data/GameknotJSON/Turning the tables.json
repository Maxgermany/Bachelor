        "1. c4": "Hi everyone, just to say that in this game it looked as though I was in yet another bit of bother.  I had an IQP that I seemed destined to lose.  But a premature king walk by my opponent resulted in me being able to turn the tables on him.  Hence the title.",
        "1... c5": "2................ c5 - a symmetrical English.  This move dissuades 3. d4.",
        "2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 Nf6": "3. ............ Nf6 - the symmetry continues - it is an English Four Knights!",
        "4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4": "5. Nxd4 - one pair of pawns is exchanged and the symmetry is broken.  I can take the knight on e4 but then that only brings the Wicked Witch of The West on to that square.",
        "5... e6 6. Nc2 d5 7. cxd5": "6. ..........d5 - triggers off a plethora of exchanges leading to an IQP.  This pawn will be lost, but, wait and see!",
        "7... Nxd5 8. Nxd5 Qxd5 9. Qxd5 exd5": "9. ................ exd5 - Voila!",
        "10. Bd2 Be6 11. O-O-O O-O-O 12. Bc3 f6": "12. .............. f6 - both sides have castled queenside to attack and defend the IQP simultaneously.  My last move is played to prevent Bxg2 and give an extended defensive line for Frere Leblanc (lsb) to retreat to if attacked.",
        "13. a3 Bc5": "13. ...................Bc5 - I now complete my development and both rooks are connected.",
        "14. e3": "14.  e3 - white returns the compliment and opens up a line for his lsb.",
        "14... Rd7 15. Nd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 Bxd4 17. Rxd4 Rc7+": "17. ................. Rc7  - after a plethora of exchanges both sides are left with one lsb and a pair of rooks.  I put the question to the white king.",
        "18. Kd2 Rd8 19. Be2": "19. Be2 - now white completes his development.",
        "19... a6": "19. ..................a6 - preventing white's bishop from landing on b5 - in fact this move eventually becomes crucial in that it enables me to land a deadly rook check on that square.",
        "20. Rd1 Kb8 21. Bd3 f5": "21. .................. f5 - to screen the white lsb's attack on my h pawn and to answer a possible e4 by fxe4.",
        "22. Bb1 Rcd7": "22.  ...............Rcd7 - to bolster the IQP.",
        "23. Kc3": "23. Kc3 - the start of a king walk that proves to be fatal - for white!",
        "23... Rc8+": "23. ............ Rc8  - I am in no mood to \"wait for the executioner\"!",
        "24. Kb4 Rdc7": "24. .............. Rdc7 - confining the white king to the a and b files, if dmaestro does not look out his king could be walking right into a mating net!",
        "25. Ba2 Rc7c2": "25. .............. Rc2 - here comes a bone in the throat - my rook is now attacking the f2 pawn and the b2 pawn for that matter.",
        "26. Rd1d2": "26. Rd1d2 - would the other rook move to d2 have been better?",
        "26... Rc8c5": "26. ............... Rc8c5 - trying to bring in the mating net, can I get enough pieces to do it though?",
        "27. Bxd5": "27. Bxd5?? - grabs the IQP but I think this is a blunder, now here comes that deadly ................",
        "27... Rb5+": "27. .................... Rb5 !!  Yes, a deadly move - this will net at least a piece for a pawn!",
        "28. Ka4": "28 . Ka4 - forced - this is white's only legal move.",
        "28... Rxd2": "28. ................... Rxd2 - this is the winning move which prompts a white flag from my opponent.  If Rxd2 then Bxd5 winning the bishop and becoming a piece for a pawn up.  Good result after being saddled with an IQP."
