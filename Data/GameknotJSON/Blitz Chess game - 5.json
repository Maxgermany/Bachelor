        "1. b4": "My favourite opening. The orangutan. Uncommon and very unusual. Few players use this opening.",
        "1... e5": "A cautious response from black.",
        "2. Bb2 d6": "Black defends nicely.",
        "3. e4": "A grab for central control.",
        "3... Be6": "Nott one of the players that I have played this opening against have come back with this sequence of moves.",
        "4. Nc3 Nf6": "Standard development.",
        "5. d3 Be7": "He is now free to castle whenever he wants.",
        "6. g3": "I rarely play the king fiancetto but the centre is very crowded and I don't want to further that. Besides I like closed up king-sides and open queen-sides.",
        "6... O-O 7. Bg2": "The second step in the fiancetto. His king is already safe so I want to geet a move on.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nf3": "I'm fine with leaving the b4 pawn unguarded because I can sense a push down the centre. And I'm worried about the d4 square.",
        "8... d5": "The push as I predicted.",
        "9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Bxd5": "I can sense that he is keen to attack now. I have to be careful.",
        "11. O-O": "The king fiancetto is now complete.",
        "11... Re8 12. c4": "Forcing him back.",
        "12... Be6 13. b5 Nb4": "Mistake! d4 would've been better. He might lose his knight now.",
        "14. Ne1 Rb8": "And now he's lost it.",
        "15. a3": "At this point black resigned. His knight is trapped and it is one of his few developed pieces. It seems that he thought it was a pivotal piece and he couldn't afford to lose it."
