        "4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3 e5": "I nowadays avoid this type of move! Makes a nasty hole in my pawn structure on e6. But this game I played two years ago and then I obviously believed it was a decent move. ",
        "7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3": "f3 looks a little bit unsound for me? Better was maybe Be2 or Bd3?",
        "8... Be7 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. O-O-O": "0-0-0! Now f3 looks like a perfectly fine move, preparing a pawn push against Black`s King!",

        "17... f6 18. Qxh7+": "Getting the pawn back with tempo and also ruins Blacks King camp.",

        "21... Bxb3": "Not good of me. The light-squared Bishop has more utlity in the defense of my King. Makes my white squares weak, because Black has still his light-square Bishop left.",
