        "1. Nf3": "Hi everyone!\n\nSo in my last annotated game against the Caveman, Coach Ion concluded that Fou Leblanc had let Henry down a bundle by moving to the wrong square.  In this game I find myself in another piece ending and with both sides having light square bishops.  In the endgame I end up being the player with the pawn plus against my fellow Class A opponent.  But will this give Fou Leblanc the opportunity to make amends and to help Henry bring the game to a satisfactory conclusion? Well, you'll just have to read on.",
        "1... d5": "1. \u2026.. d5 - white kicks off with the Reti Opening and I make the most common response to it.",
        "2. d4 c5 3. c4": "3. c4 - transposing into a Queen's Gambit.",
        "3... dxc4 4. e3 cxd4 5. Bxc4": "5. Bxc4 - and now it is a QGA.",
        "5... Nc6 6. exd4 e6": "6. \u2026.. e6 - preparing to develop Fou Lenoir.",
        "7. Nc3 Bb4": "7. \u2026\u2026. Bb4 - pin.",
        "8. Bd2": "8. Bd2 - unpin.",
        "8... Nf6 9. O-O O-O": "9. \u2026\u2026. 0-0 - both kings tuck themselves away on the kingside.",
        "10. Rc1": "10. Rc1?! - this move starts off some explosive activity in the centre and this is where I end up with the pawn plus.",
        "10... Nxd4 11. a3 Nxf3+ 12. Qxf3 Qxd2 13. axb4 Qxb2 14. Rcb1 Qd2": "14. \u2026\u2026. Qd2 - after a whirlwind of captures and exchanges Glenda takes evasive action.",
        "15. Bd3": "15. Bd3 - clever.  If Glenda should play Qxc3?? then Bxh7+ loses her to the WQ.  So on the next turn she retreats to h6.",
        "15... Qh6 16. Ne4 Nxe4 17. Bxe4": "17. Bxe4 - knight trade.",
        "17... Rb8 18. Qg3 Bd7 19. Qc7": "19. Qc7 - sssss - nasty - nasty!",
        "19... Bb5": "19. \u2026.. Bb5 - but Fou Leblanc is able to escape with a threat.",
        "20. Rfc1": "20. Rfc1 - of which white parries strongly.",
        "20... a6 21. Bxb7 Qf6 22. Bf3 Qd8": "22. \u2026\u2026 Qd8 - trying to trade my way out of passivitis but white declines the Queen trade.",
        "23. Qf4 Rc8 24. Rxc8 Qxc8": "24. \u2026\u2026. Qxc8 - but there is a rook trade.",
        "25. Rc1 Qd7 26. Rc7": "26. Rc7 - again very nasty, but Glenda now puts the WK in Old Matey's shadow.",
        "26... Qd3": "26. \u2026\u2026. Qd3 - yup, Qf1# is threatened.",
        "27. Qc1 Qb3 28. Qe1": "28. Qe1 - defends pawn on b4.",
        "28... g6 29. h3 Qb2": "29. \u2026\u2026. Qb2 - taking control of the a1-h8 diagonal before the WQ does.",
        "30. Qc3 Qxc3 31. Rxc3": "31. Rxc3 - now the queens have finally been traded off.  I am still a pawn up, but will it be enough to win in what is now an endgame?  We shall see.",
        "31... Rd8 32. g3 Rd4 33. Rb3": "33. Rb3 - everything is being concentrated on the weakie pawn on b4.",
        "33... Rd3 34. Rxd3 Bxd3": "34. \u2026.. Bxd3 - and now we have that bishop ending.  Now Henry needs to get to the pawn on b4 before the WK does.",
        "35. Bd1 Bb5 36. Bb3 Kf8": "36. \u2026..Kf8 - Henry starts his march.",
        "37. f4 Ke7 38. Kf2 f6 39. Ke3 Kd6 40. h4 h6": "40. \u2026.. h6 - pawn wall.",
        "41. g4 g5 42. hxg5 hxg5": "42. \u2026..hxg5 - pawn trade.",
        "43. Ba2 e5 44. f5": "44. f5 - trying to create a block.  I am, however, prepared to be very patient.",
        "44... Bc6 45. Bc4 Bb7 46. Bb3 Kc6": "46. \u2026..Kc6 - Henry continues his mission to try and gobble up that juicy looking b4 pawn.",
        "47. Bc4 Kb6 48. Bd3 Bc6 49. Bc4 a5 50. bxa5+ Kxa5": "50. \u2026.. Kxa5 - however, after getting nowhere we have a pawn trade.  I do at least get a passer on the e column, but will I be able to push it?  We shall see.",
        "51. Be2 Kb4 52. Ba6 Kc3 53. Be2 Kc2": "53. \u2026\u2026. Kc2 - Henry is now trying to get over to the kingside so that he can perhaps take off one or both of the remaining white pawns and shepherd one of my kingside pawns through to Glendadom.",
        "54. Bd3+ Kd1 55. Be2+ Ke1": "55. \u2026\u2026. Ke1 - these checks have just driven Henry ever closer to the white pawns.",
        "56. Bd3 Bg2 57. Be2 e4 58. Bc4 Bf3": "58. \u2026\u2026 Bf3 - now Fou Leblanc is doing well.  I now plan to exchange my e pawn for white's g4 pawn.  I will then put Henry on f2 and that will give my g pawn a protected path to Glendadom.  After I took the pawn on g4 on the next turn, white realised my plan and waved the white flag.  Good work in the end by Fou Leblanc.  Wheew!",
