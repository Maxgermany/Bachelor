        "3. Nxe5 dxe4 4. Bc4 Qd4": "This was very risky but the only move to save his knight would have to be 4.Qd4 Qh5 and then white's queen would inevitably be chased around the board.",
        "5. c3 Qxe5 6. O-O Qg5": "Once again I've been rather stupid. This is a terrible move.",
        "7. g3": "The correct move.",
        "7... Bh3 8. Re1 Qf5": "To protect black's e-pawn",
        "9. Be2": "To stop 9. ... Qf3 threatening checkmate.",
        "9... Bc5": "Black's intention's are  to take his pawn wth check then checkmate white on g2.",
        "10. d4 Bb6 11. a3": "? A very strange move. It seems white might be trying to get a good pawn structure, but on the wrong side.",
        "11... Nf6 12. Nd2 Ng4": "Threatening to go for the f2 pawn again.",
        "13. Nxe4": "This is a very good move. White protects the f2 square and black's queen can't take it because 13.Nxe4 Qxe4 14. Bb5  wins black's queen.",
        "13... Nc6 14. Bf3 O-O-O": "Black now looks at piling up on d4 and maybe sacrificing a piece.",
        "15. Be3": "White anticipates black's plan.",
        "15... Rhe8": "Black attacks white's knight which is only defended once.",
        "16. b4": "? While normally in this position this would have been a good move, while black is threatening numerous checkmates perhaps the best offense is a good defense?",
        "16... Rxe4 17. Bxe4 Qxe4": "Threating checkmate on f2.",
