        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. O-O Nc6 8. d5 Ne7": "Annotated by Mark Taimanov in March 2004, nearly 33 years after the match. My idea of presenting it here is for the lessons we can learn from this game. \"I had no doubts that this position will appear in our match, and probably my opponent had similar expectations.  Both of us belonged to a category of polemists of principle, ready to assert our belief in the King\u2019s Indian \u2018tableau\u2019, which was always a favorite weapon for me with White and for Fischer with Black.\n\nBut who would have the first opportunity to present a prepared surprise?\" ",
        "9. Bd2": "Fischer might have expected here 9.Ne1, 9.Nd2, or 9.b4, which had repeatedly featured in my games.  I worked out with my second especially for this match this calm developing move with the Bishop, which has the goal of prompt mobilization of forces of the queenside.",
        "9... Ne8": "Fischer was always most versed in opening subtleties of his favorite systems. He certainly knew that a conventional maneuver 9...Nh5 here is inexpedient in view of 10.g3 f5 11.exf5 Bxf5 12.Ng5 Nf6 13.g4 Bd7 14.Nge4 Nxe4 15.Nxe4.",
        "10. Rc1": "The move 10.b4 has been frequently tested here, however I rejected it as superfluous to the scheme I had prepared.",
        "10... f5": "This position was already essayed in our first game of the match.  There I played 11.exf5 and then 11...gxf5 12.Ng5 h6 13.Ne6 Bxe6 14.dxe6 Qc8 15.Qb3 c6 led to a double-edged position with mutual chances.  That game proceeded fascinatingly, the scales inclined to one side then the other several times.  I was the last to make a mistake in time trouble and lost the game, but it was obvious that the opening conversation had not been exhausted, and that the discussion would be continued.  So, it happened.",
        "11. Qb3": "My innovation comes first!  This follows my preparation for the duel!  The main idea from the first game remains: transfer the knight to e6 followed by opening the center, but the text sharply enlivens the tactical set-up.  The Queen from b3 'X-rays' the Black King, and simultaneously 'looks' at the b7-pawn, which could be vulnerable to capture after an eventual exchange of the bishop for the e6-knight.  The theoretical dispute with Fischer has found a new impulse!",
        "11... b6": "Fischer thought on this reply for a long time (which testifies to the advantage obtained by his opponent's home preparation) and probably came to the conclusion of the necessity of first stopping the advance c4-c5, which promotes White's chances to open the strategically important c-file.  Subsequently analysts put forward alternative ideas of merit - 11. f4 (I. Boleslavsky) and 11... Kh8 (M. Tal).",
        "12. exf5 gxf5": "It is always basic with Fischer.  With 12... Nxf5 or 12... Bxf5, White's possession of the outpost e4 ensures a stable positional advantage",
        "13. Ng5": "The general plan in operation \u2013 the knight is aiming at e6",
        "13... Nf6": " In case of 13...h6 14.Ne6 Bxe6 15.dxe6 Qc8 (or 15...c6 16.Bh5!) a highly advantageous continuation for White is 16.Nd5 Qxe6 17.Nxe7+ Qxe7 18.c5+ Kh8 19.cxd6 Nxd6 (or 19...cxd6 20.Rfd1) 20.Rc6!, confirmed by my game with M. Tseitlin played two years later.",
        "14. f4": "An important part of the preconceived plan, whose value Fischer apparently underestimated...",
        "14... h6": "Fischer trusts in the reliability of Black's formation and bravely enters uncompromising conflict. More circumspect, but also more \"yielding\" would have been 14...e4.  However in this case White gains obvious positional advantages by way of 15.Nd1 h6 16.Nh3 followed by Ne3, Nf2 and Bc3.  Such conformism is alien to Fischer and he never opted for such passive continuations.",
        "15. fxe5 dxe5": "Certainly Fischer must not have liked the continuation 15...hxg5 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Bh5.",
        "16. c5": "But I think this blow turned out to be an unexpected and distressing surprise for Fischer.  The battery of white pieces has come into action!  However, had I been in a less martial mood, I might have contented myself with the quiet 16.Nf3, maintaining White's doubtless positional plusses. (My humble comment: This move is the cause of rapid deterioration of White's advantage. 16.Nf3 as Taimanov notes is the correct move to maintain White's advantage. Here the psychology of Taimanov is revealed! He was in an aggressive mood and relied on attack and ignored the requirements of the position. Have we all also fallen prey to such emotions in our games? Sure we did. It is part of the learning in this game. Chess logic overrides emotions and player strengths. We have to play according to the requirements of the position. )",
        "16... Nfxd5": "It is obvious that the alternative 16...hxg5 17.d6+ Kh8 18.dxe7 Qxe7 19.cxb6 axb6 20.Bxg5 was quite unattractive, as well as the reply 16...Kh8 in view of 17.d6!\n\nHand-to-hand fighting begins where courageous imagination, exact calculation and ... strong nerves are required.  By the way, in this game, nerves \"played pranks\" on both players.",
        "17. Nxd5 Nxd5 18. cxb6 axb6": "Certainly the continuation 18...hxg5 19.Bxg5 Qd6 20.b7 Bxb7 21.Qxb7 is not advantageous for Black.",
        "19. Rc6": "The \"Salt\" of the large-scale tactical operation begun by White nine moves back!  All White's pieces have occupied threatening positions, and the threat of eventually supplementing the attack with the addition of a bishop at c4 throws my opponent into emergency mode.",
        "19... Kh8": "Perhaps the only means of defense. In case of 19...hxg5 20.Bc4 Kh8 21.Bxd5 f4 (or 21...g4) 22.Rc3! with the double threat of 23. Rh3+ and 23. Bxa8, which is impossible to prevent.\n\nI do not stint on one more diagram as it not only reflects both the culmination and turning-point of this game, but the match as a whole.  Fischer himself later recognized it: \"It was the turning point of the match.  Taimanov missed a win by 20. Qh3.\"  It additionally serves as a reference point to all the subsequent and unpredictable dramatic peripeteias [ed. philosophical self-questioning, Aristotle] which befell me.\n\nI remember that at that moment I felt a veritable ecstasy from the struggle - I estimated the position as rather advantageous.  I trusted in success, pleased at my good luck employing my opening preparation, and in the idea of rapid development of the initiative -and the maneuver 20. Qh3, for example.  Was it was possible to anticipate that all this would turn to ashes?!\n\nDisappointment began from the moment when I, cheerfully having estimated the position, began to concretely calculate variations.  It was obvious that after 20.Qh3 Black in view of the threat 21. Rxh6+ has only two defenses - 20...Nf6 and 20...Rf6.  I began to examine them in the happy belief that any attempt to cover the gaping approaches to the Black King would be impossible.\n\nThe move 20...Nf6 really did not shake my optimism.  Variations found without any special work are: 20.Qh3 Nf6 21.Bc3 f4 ( other continuations are worse. For example, 21...Bd7 22.Ne6 Bxe6 23.Rxe6; or 21...Ng4 22.Rg6! Rf6 23.Qh5) 22.Qh4 Bb7 ( 22...Qe8 23.Bf3!) 23.Rd1 Qe7 24.Re6 Qc5+ 25.Kh1 are obviously developments to White's benefit.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019t find any decisive continuation on 20...Rf6 in any continuation.  First it seemed to me that good is 21.Qh5, but in testing it I didn\u2019t like 21...Bd7! 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Nf7+ Kh7 24.Nxh6 Bxh6 25.Bxh6 Qg6!.  The idea of 21.Nf7+ Rxf7 22.Bxh6 was entertained, but I found a refutation at once in 22...Bf6.  At last I found the best plan: 21.Bc4! when really, in view of 21...Rxc6 22.Nf7+, the White rook is impregnable.  Now 22.Rxf6 is simply threatened, and both replies 21...Bd7 22.Bxd5 and 21...Bb7 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Rxf5 are poor.\n\nIt would seem that the required decision has held up to scrutiny, but is complicated by the response 21\u2026 f4.  To everything that I have here examined, alas, there was an objection:\n\nOn 22.Qh5 possible was 22...Bb7 23.Bxd5 (or 23.Rxf6 Qxf6) 23...Qxd5;\nOn 22.Qh4 - Bb7 23.Ne6 Qd7;\nOn 22.Qd3 - 22...hxg5 23.Rxf6 Bxf6;\nAnd finally on 22.Qf3!? - Bb7! 23.Rxf6 (23.Ne6 Qd7! 24.Bxd5 Rxe6!) 23...Nxf6! 24.Nf7+ Kh7 25.Qxb7 (25.Bd3+ Kg8!) 25...Qxd2 26.Qxa8 Qd4+ 27.Kh1 Qxc4.\n\nIn all variations Fischer emerges in the clear.\n\nIt was amazing!  All my understanding of chess, all my experience and flair convinced me this position should be won, but concrete ways to victory did not appear.  Disappointed in 20. Qh3!, I began to evaluate other ideas - 20. Rd1, 20. Bc4, but",
        "20. Nf3": "The capitulation...(My humble addition, Emmanuel Lasker said, \"The difficult part of chess is to win a won game\". How prophetic!!! It is no wonder that Lasker is called \"Thinker of chess\". It is amazing that Fischer himself thought that 20. Qh3! would win for White and probably would have psychologically surrendered the game. Finally, 20. Qh3 is in fact the best move here although it does not win against accurate play. Who knows what would have happened if that move was played. Was it destiny favoring Fischer? :)",
        "20... Bb7 21. Rg6 Nf4": "A magnificent idea.  By exchanging the opponent's dark-squared bishop, Fischer deprives White of any further illusions.",
        "22. Bxf4 exf4": "At the cost of a deterioration in the central pawn structure, Fischer opens the game and the bishops find their invincible power.  It is one more example of his favorite method of transformation of one kind of advantage to another.",
        "23. Rd1 Qe7 24. Re6 Qc5+ 25. Kf1 Rfd8": "Fischer is in his element.  Intercepting the initiative, he develops offensive potential all over the board with irrepressible energy.  First of all he threatens 26... Bd5.",
        "26. Rxd8+ Rxd8 27. Qa4": "A hope to simplify the defense by eventual rook exchanges turned out to be in vain.",
        "27... Qc1+ 28. Kf2": "Better is 28.Ne1",
        "28... Bf8": "A universal maneuver - it prevents simplifications, (29.Re8?? Bc6)  and creates a terrible threat: 29... Bc5+ ",
        "29. b4 Be4": "Black's attack develops itself, and his doubled pawns provide important outposts for his pieces.",
        "30. Re8": "The evidence of hopelessness and confusion.  In any case more persistent would be 30.Qb5 so that in the event of 30...Qe3+ 31.Kf1 Rd1+, to be protected by the move 32.Ne1.  Alas, at this moment I no longer owned my nerves...(My humble observation: Look at that comment !! \"I no longer owned my nerves\" A Grandmaster is reduced to nothing!)",
        "30... Bc6 31. Qxc6": "Nothing changes by 31.Rxd8 Bxa4 32.Rxf8+ Kg7",
        "31... Qxc6 32. Rxd8 Qf6": "The rest is clear and simple without need of comment.",
        "33. Rc8 Qe7 34. Kf1 Kh7 35. Nd4 Bg7 36. Nb5 Be5 37. a3 Qd7 38. Ra8 f3 39. gxf3 Bxh2 40. Kg2 Qg7+ 41. Kxh2 Qe5+ 42. Kg1 Qxb5": "In this position the game was adjourned and, certainly, I resigned without resuming play.  Perhaps, it is the most bitter game of my life.  I felt it sharply at first, then painfully for many years...\n\n(My humble comments:  Lessons I have learnt from this famous game are given below:\n1. Positional assessment is difficult for even the top players including Fischer. So play carefully trying to assess the position as the moves unfold.\n2. When your idea fails, don't start brooding, accept the position and play for a draw at least.\n3. Expect the unexpected! \n4. Take it as only a  game. Don't get psychologically wrecked by one game. Mark Taimanov's contributions to opening theory are well respected in Benoni, King's Indian defence and Sicilian. So after all it is a game, enjoy it!!!)"
