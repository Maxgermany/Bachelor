        "1. e4": "Hello, everybody! It's been a while since I annotated a game here, now I've finally found the sufficient will to do another :-)\n\nThis is a nice game I've played from the 61st GK tournament. There wasn't much between me and two other players (my opponent in this game, corleone_to, and filinout) and this game was actually the decisive one that allowed me to capture first place in our group (all other games between the three of us were hard-fought draws).",
        "1... c6": "The Caro Kann defense, a very solid opening that was championed by Capablanca, Botvinnik and Karpov among others.",
        "2. d4": "I play 2.d3 against the French very often, while not so much against the Caro Kann. Maybe I should give it a try sometimes.",
        "2... d5 3. Nc3": "3.e5, 3.exd5 and 3.Nd2 are the other popular responses.",
        "3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5": "The Capablanca Variation. Black gets his bad bishop outside the pawn chain. Other possibilities are 4...Nf6 and 4...Nd7.",
        "5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6": "7...Nd7 is most common here, leading to 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3 which is very popular and black stands very well.",
        "8. Ne5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 Nd7 11. f4 Be7 12. Bd2": "A pawn sacrifice for the sake of development. I could probably have tried 12.h5, but there 12...Qb6 is an annoying move, preventing the development of the Bc1. White could try 13.Nc4 and after 13...Qc7 14.Bd2. 12...Ngf6 should also be perfectly playable.",
        "12... Bxh4": "Black accepts the challenge. In retrospect, I think the more prudent 12...Ngf6 was better. But I imagine I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation either.",
        "13. O-O-O Be7": "White has gained several tempi here and I think he has an advantage, despite being down a pawn now. \n\n13...Bxg3 may lead to 14.Qxg3 Qf6 (14...g6 15.Nxg6!) 15.Nc4! (threatening 16.Nd6 and 17.Nxb7) and I think white has the upper hand.\n\n13...Nxe5 14.fxe5 Bxg3 is somewhat better, 15.Qxg3 Rh7 (which is probably too passive, even if it seems ok for now). After 15...g6 16.Bg5 and black has trouble completing his development. 15...Ne7, giving back material, seems risky, but may be the best idea, 16.Qxg7 Rg8 17.Qh7 (not 17.Qxh6 Qxd4!) Rxg2 and I think black might untangle.",
        "14. Nh5": "Threatening Nxg7.",
        "14... Bf8": "Probably not best. 14...Kf8 wasn't good because of 15.Qg3 Rh7 (15...g6? 16.Nxg6) 16.f5 with an attack. The best try may be 14...Bf6 15.Qg3 Qe7 16.Nxg7 Bxg7 17.Qxg7 Qf6 18.Qg4 or 18.Qg3, but white is still better.",
        "15. Qg3": "Logical, but this is actually not best. 15.Nxf7!, which I didn't see at all, was best, leading to 15...Kxf7 16.f5! and white has a big attack. There's nothing forcing, but black can easily go wrong.\n\nThe careless 16...Ngf6? runs into 17.fxe6+ Kxe6 (17...Kg8!? 18.exd7) 18.Nf4+ and now 18...Kd6 19.Bb4+ Kc7 20.Ne6 wins the queen or 18...Kf7 19.Qb3+ Ke8 (19...Nd5 20.Nxd5) 20.R(either)e1+ Be7 21.Ng6.\n\nAgain, giving back material with the tricky 16...Nc5 is an option, where white actually can't take 17.dxc5? because of 17...Qxd3 18.cxd3 exf5 and black is up a pawn, if a bit tied up at the moment. White should probably continue the attack with something like 17.Qh3 and black seems forced to give the knight back anyway (17...Ne4 18.fxe6 Ke7 19.Bb4 Nd6 20.Qf5 Nf6 21.Nf4 or something, piling on the pressure) and play 17...exf5 18.dxc5 Ne7 19.Bc3 and white is much better.\n\n16...e5? isn't any good either, 17.Qc4+ Ke8 18.dxe5.\n\nI won't state it categorically, but 'tis likely that white missed a winning try with 15.Nxf7! Kxf7 16.f5!. Instead, black is able to relieve some pressure.",
        "15... Nxe5 16. dxe5": "I thought the d-file was more important than the f-file (16.fxe5), mainly as to prevent black from castling queenside.",
        "16... g6 17. Bc3": "An in-between move to secure the d-file (refer to my comment under 16.dxe5). 17.Bb4 Qc7 18.Bxf8 Kxf8 19.Nf6 Nxf6 20.exf6 was also possible and it may even have been better, avoiding all the trouble black's 19th move in the game gave me.",
        "17... Qc7 18. Nf6+": "No turning back.",
        "18... Nxf6 19. exf6 Bd6": "Black is only one move away from consolidating with O-O-O. I felt I had to do something and rejected the obvious 20.Be5.",
        "20. Rxd6": "Burning the bridges! An exchange sacrifice, more out of frustration than anything (I didn't see 23.f5 at first, which I should have), seeing how black had slowly neutralized my initiative with exchanges and careful defense. 20.Be5 was the more logical alternative, but which allows 20...Bxe5 (20...O-O-O? 21.Rxd6! and 22.f5) 21.fxe5 and only the heavy pieces remain. White might still have a symbolic advantage, but black should probably draw with careful play.",
        "20... Qxd6 21. Rd1 Qc7 22. Be5 Qa5 23. f5": "Only here I realized the strength of 23.f5!. Black is suddenly in trouble and it isn't easy to find the correct reply.",
        "23... exf5": "No! This is probably the decisive mistake, which seems to lose by force. The only move seems to be 23...Rd8! and after 24.Rxd8+ Kxd8 25.b4 (inviting Qxb4, to stop the attack on the bishop) Qd5! and black should hold.\n\nI had also calculated 23...gxf5 24.Qg7 Rf8 25.Bd6 O-O-O 26.Bxf8 winning a piece, but after 26...Rxd1+ 27.Kxd1 Qd5+ 28.Kc1 Qd4! black has some chances at a perpetual. Even this was preferable to the move played.",
        "24. Qe3": "The key move, now black is in big trouble.",
        "24... Kf8 25. Rd7": "Precision is of utmost importance, the careless 25.Bd6+? ruins everything, since after 25...Kg8 black escapes. 25.Rd7 also threatens Bd6+ and Qe7, say 25...Rd8 26.Bd6+ Kg8 27.Qe7.",
        "25... Kg8": "25...Qxa2 26.Qc5+ and 27.Qe7.",
        "26. Bc3": "With tempo, threatening 27.Qe7.",
        "26... Qxa2": "Trying to defend the f7-square, but it's too late.",
        "27. Qe7": "Now white threatens 28.b3 obstructing the a2-g8 diagonal.",
        "27... Qc4": "27...Rf8? 28.Qxf8!, but even this is hopeless.",
        "28. b3": "Black's queen has nowhere to go. 28...Qe6 29.Qxe6 fxe6 30.f7+ or 28...Qd5 29.Rxd5 and it's curtains. Black resigns.\n\nIt was an interesting battle, full of possibilities for both sides which I didn't see during the game. A very satisfying win in the end, especially because of the circumstances (see under 1.e4) and because my opponent is a really good player.\n\nAnd for those reading, hopefully it was an interesting game to go through. All criticism is as always welcome and thank you for stopping by!\n\nP.S.: I may do a little revision in the next few days if I have the time."
