        "4... b5 5. a4 c6 6. Nc3 Qb6 7. Bd2": "Not too keen on this move. It's not clear at the moment what is the best square for this bishop, so leave it at home for the time being. It's better to continue the attack with axb5 and then b3. Once the pawn situation has been resolved, the next priority is castling.",
        "7... b4 8. Ne4 Bxf3": "A strange (and a weak) move. This just gives the initiative to White.",
        "9. Qxf3 Nd7 10. Bxc4 Ndf6 11. O-O": "Black would like to play 11...Nxe4 12.Qxe4 Nf6, so you could play 11.Nc5 to prevent the exchange and make it more difficult for Black to develop his other knight.",
        "11... e6 12. Rfc1": "Logical - attacking the only weakness in his position.",
        "12... Be7 13. Nxf6+ Nxf6 14. Bb5": "Nice!",
        "14... O-O 15. Rxc6 Qb8 16. Rac1 Nd5 17. e4": "It's always very tempting to play moves like this, but you need to be aware that it weakens your d-pawn.",
        "17... Nb6 18. a5": "Leaves the bishop unprotected and drives the knight to a more central square. If you look at which piece is doing least, it's the queen. So Qb3 is the best move.",
        "18... Nd7 19. Bc4": "Ba4 was better. The bishop is doing nothing here and your rook on c6 is now unprotected.",
        "19... Bf6 20. e5 Be7 21. Qg4 g6 22. Bxe6 fxe6 23. Qxe6+": "Well played! I think Black can resign here.",
