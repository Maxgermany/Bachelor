    "moves": {
        "1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3": "Classical QGD (queen's gambit declined) opening. Still in use even at the highest levels",
        "4... c5": "I personally favour c5 here (before Nc6) to open up the centre",
        "5. Nf3 a6": "to prevent an annoying break-in of the white knight, and to solidify a possible queen-side pawn rush",
        "6. a4": "a bold advance; not bad but a3 might have been more careful. Or then developing a bishop",
        "6... Nc6": "the route via b4 is now possible for this knight (which is why 6. a3 had been better)",
        "7. cxd5 exd5 8. dxc5": "This move has little purpose. The white bishops sit an stare at the movement!",
        "8... Bxc5 9. Be2 O-O 10. O-O": "finally, a white bishop is out. both players castle",
        "10... Be6 11. Bd2": "and the other bishop",
        "11... Bd6 12. h3": "a sound move preventing interventions via g4, and paving the way for a possible pawn ruch on the K-side later",
        "12... Qb6": "frees the rook interplay on the 8th row and prepares for Q-side attack",
        "13. Rb1": "Rb1 is understandable, but unnecessary. A developing move such as Bd3 had been better. If black had then taken the b pawn, his queen would have quickly been in trouble. 13. Bd3 Qxb2 14. a5",
        "13... Bf5 14. a5": "excellent move!",
        "14... Nxa5 15. Na4": "a good move again. The alternative had been to take hold of the c-file (15. Rc1); if 15....Qxb2 16. Na4 and black loses the knight ",
        "15... Qd8 16. Rc1 Rc8 17. Nd4": "This is all right, but a rook exchange at c8 was an alternative",
        "17... Rxc1": "black is up in material and the exchange is warranted",
        "18. Qxc1": "yes! much better than 18. Bxc1",
        "18... Bg6": "The position here is fairly even, I think, with some black advantage due to better development",
        "19. Qc3": "19. Qc3? is the move that soon leads to white's downfall, for reasons to be seen in a moment. Perhaps the best move for white had been 19. Nc5 attacking on the Q-side and threatening to exchange black's DSB",
        "19... Nc4": "note that 20. Bxc4 dxc4 21. Qxc4 leads to 21.....b5 ",
        "20. b3": "but it is this move (20. b3) that loses. White fails to note the danger of the unprotected e4 square available to the other black knight",
        "20... Ne4": "this leads to a minimum loss of white's DSB, which is protected only by the queen (who is now herself under attack). White resigns. I think white played very well up to the last two mistrakes indicated, which could have been avoided by some more careful analysis \u00e0 la id=elyhim"
