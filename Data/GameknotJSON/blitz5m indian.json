    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6": "So we are aiming for a Indian defence.",
        "5. Bd3 O-O 6. Nge2": "Trying not to block f3 point. I have seen positions like the one we are playing that wither advance there with f4, or block moving f2-f3 and then focus on the queen side. I am more prone to attack the king, but this time, I will go for a slower approach.",
        "6... e5 7. d5 a5": "Didn\u00b4t think of this, was kind of a surprise, but it hampers somehow my idea to advance on the queen side. But it also seems to me that creates a weakness (that I did not exploit properly)",
        "8. O-O Nbd7 9. f3": "As I said, with this I prevent a potential ...Ng4 (threatening my bishop in e3 if moved there) and then...f5",
        "9... Nc5 10. Be3": "Did not think much of my BB in d3, since it doesn\u00b4t seem to help defending nor attacking the black king, although it does support my advance on the left flank. Maybe I should have saved it, but thought I needed to gain some moves in order to make progress. Be3 seems good enough. It does even support a more flexible attack on either side of the board.",
        "10... Nxd3 11. Qxd3 b6": "With the idea of c5 maybe? I thought so, and didn\u00b4t like it, but I did not considered that after ...c5: dxc, d column is open and e6 is a weak point to attack. Shame on me (I just saw that, during this analysis)",
        "12. a3": "To support \"b4\" and then \"c5\" advances.",
        "12... a4": "Interesting. But it may again create a weak pawn difficult to defend.",
        "13. Rfb1": "Maybe 13.Nb5 was more effective, with the idea of 14.Nec3 and Qc2, attacking a4",
        "13... Bd7 14. b4 axb3 e.p. 15. Rxb3 Nh5": "Starting the grand opening characteristic of this Indian variant.",
        "16. Nb5": "After playing this, I realized it doesn\u00b4t do much; it does defend a3 and opens the 3 line for the rook in case it needs to join the defence, but nothing else.",
        "16... f5": "Continuing with the good plan. Black now has two approaches: fxe (the game) or f4 and then moving the rest of g and h pawns to attack the king. It is a solid attack.",
        "17. Rc1": "I wanted to remove my rook from a1 since there was a future capture with the bishop in g7 (way ahead, I know, but I wanted to prevent it), and supporting a putative sacrifice (that at this point I did not see clear at all). But I should have stuck to a different plan: if not interested in defence, at least let\u00b4s create some trouble, advancing through \"a\" column. Or  else joined the defence on f1.",
        "17... fxe4 18. fxe4 g5": "Trying to support N in f4. Had the white not removed the rook from a1, now a direct Nf4 would have been possible. At this time, I felt sort of at a crossroads: either defend my king, and I had the feeling it was sort of late (I should have started a few moves back) or committing my pieces to attack the left flank. And I saw what I thought it was an interesting sacrifice. It took me more than a minute to make up my mind, but after movement 19, I replied with two quick movements trying to put some pressure on black.",
        "19. Nxc7": "And there we go. Now that I have finished the game, I\u00b4d give this a\"?\" or maybe a \"?!\", since there is an important thing: c8 is a white square, controlled by BB, and therefore, difficult to be a place where my pawn can become something bigger. But it is still interesting. Now is a brutal race, and black makes the exact (from my point of view) movements needed to beat white.",
        "19... Qxc7 20. Bxb6 Qc8": "Seems unique (or as good as) to me, allowing the advance on c.",
        "21. c5 Nf4": "Not only bringing the N to the attack, but also forces WN to be traded, and therefore the support it was giving to R in c1 is gone.",
        "22. Nxf4 exf4": "I was expecting gxf, and then black has a column opened on W castling. But this seems to be good as well, allowing BB in g7 to help with the attack.",
        "23. c6": "Had I have my Ne2, I would have thought of cxd, but now, this seems to be my only possibility to make progress. I had a good feeling though, since BB in d7 starts loosing squares, but that is only a mirage.",
        "23... Bg4": "I might have even helped my opponent with his attack. Now, not sure what to do. I was thinking on Qf1 (allowing R in b3 to defend f3) but thought that that would be a hanging man (woman) considering the threat of R in f8.",
        "24. Qb5": "So I aimed for the idea of supporting a4 advance, considering my only possibility of victory. I miscalculated the threats black has, even when I knew f3 advance would create havoc on my files. I even foresaw Qg4+ and though I could cover with WB in g3 on time, but , again, another threat comes into play: Bd4+. All this is a little ahead of us, but I wanted to show how many problems white is facing now.",
        "24... f3 25. gxf3": "A must I think (I thought). I may be wrong, but g3 leads to mate, and waiting for fxg2 cannot be much more helpful.",
        "25... Bxf3 26. Bf2": "This is what I was talking about.",
        "26... Qg4+": "And then I saw the mentioned 27...Bd4+. So I had to displace my king. At this point, I already had the feeling I had lost, either slowly (...Qg2+ or and Bxe4, etc) ) or faster, as it did happen in the game.",
        "27. Kf1 Bg2+ 28. Ke1 Rxf2": "Nice ending! The faster approach",
        "29. Rg3": "Trying to add some confusion...",
        "29... Qxe4+": "But black doesn\u00b4t fall for it (I am talking about making a wrong move, like \" a clear mate\" Qe2+??)",
        "30. Kxf2 Bd4+": "Game over. Very nice game, I enjoyed it a lot!"
