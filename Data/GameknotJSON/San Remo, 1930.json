        "9. f4 Ba6 10. Nf3 Qd7 11. a4": "White seems to be very aggressive, he simply did not try to move his knight, but to defend it with every attack it meets. Had he already thought about 11...Nf5 (I think so.)?",
        "11... Nbc6 12. b4": "Have a look at Alekhine's aggression!! His pawns ride so quickly, won't they? It clearly depicts his keenness for a rapid victory!!",
        "12... cxb4 13. cxb4 Bb7 14. Nd6 f5": "Can you feel a better response than 14...f5? According to me, again, 14...Nf5 would be better where White has to decide about his knight, and it even exerts some more pressure on the d4 pawn.",
        "15. a5 Nc8 16. Nxb7 Qxb7 17. a6 Qf7 18. Bb5 Nc8e7 19. O-O h6 20. Rfc1 Rfc8 21. Rc2 Qe8 22. Rac1 Rab8 23. Qe3 Rc7 24. Rc2c3 Qd7 25. Rc1c2 Kf8 26. Qc1": "Too many attacking pieces are watching at the pinned knight on c6, which has become almost unmovable. Every black piece, except some pawns are quite restricted to move.\nNimzowitsch has nothing more than 26...Rbc8.",
        "26... Rbc8 27. Ba4 b5": "A final desperate attempt to gain some time to bring the king to the position. I wonder whether Black has much time to survive!!",
        "28. Bxb5 Ke8 29. Ba4 Kd8 30. h4": "After some irrelevant pawn moves, Black has to move one of his pieces, say Qe8, then b5 will give an easy victory. So, Nimzowitsch resigns on the spot."
