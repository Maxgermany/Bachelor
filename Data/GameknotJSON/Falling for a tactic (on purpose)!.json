        "12. Nbd2": "White develops his knight, protecting against ...Bxf2 followed by the loss of the h2 pawn. Looks quite cramped around his king now.",

        "13. Kf1": "White moves his king out of the way.",
        "13... Nd5": "I push my knight forward to avoid it being pinned against my rook by Bg5.",

        "22. Nc5+": "On the surface, this tactic looks like it wins a pawn for white after ...dxc5 (23.) Bxc5... forking my knight and rook. I go along with it, because if you look further there is now a problem for white...",
        "22... dxc5": "I take the knight.",
        "23. Bxc5": "White attacks my rook and knight...",
