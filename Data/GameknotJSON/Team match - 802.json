        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5. Nc3 Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Bb5 O-O 8. O-O a6": "Fairly standard Sicilian Dragon lines ... A common favourite of mine, though if I'm honest it is because I am trying to get to know the line better as opposed to being particularly good at it.",
        "9. Bxc6 bxc6 10. f3 Qc7": "Helping my rooks to connect, and giving me more control of the e5 square.",
        "11. Nde2 d6": "Again, trying to control the e5 square and prevent the bishop becoming too much of a threat",
        "12. Kh1": "Seems early as the pin is not on, but perhaps this was to give the bishop freedom without worrying about a Queen fork at b6",
        "12... e5": "Now I am preparing for a kingside attack -- this restricts my bishop on g7, and I am hoping the compensation can make it worthwhile!",
        "13. h3 Bb7": "h3 has minimised my kingside threats, but at the cost of dubious pawn structure for white. I now transfer my desire to controlling the center, preparing to play d5 whilst connecting my rooks",
        "14. Qd3 Rad8": "d5 is now ready to be played ...",
        "15. a4 d5 16. exd5 cxd5": "I now have good control of the middle of the board, though I'm not sure quite what to do with it - I want to free up my bishop at g7, and therefore a plan involving my f6 knight would be useful",
        "17. Bg5 Rd6": "Releasing the pin whilst potentially allowing a future doubling of rooks -- need to be careful not to allow the c3 knight to become active -- looking after the b5 and e4 squares are now vital",
        "18. Bxf6 Bxf6 19. Rfd1 e4": "This push was premature. The idea is there with good pressure aiming at the white king, but I need to be very careful about the vulnerability of the d6 rook -- after the pawn swaps I have both the queen and the rook attacking the d file. Playing Rf-d1 first would have been helpful",
        "20. fxe4 d4": "Had to bottle out of the swap -- this is now very awkward, as Nxd4 is only held back by the fact the knight would then be pinned due to the positioning of the Queen",
        "21. Nd5": "A logical fork, forcing me to lose my two bishops",
        "21... Bxd5 22. b3": "A simple blunder, losing material for nothing - A game that was steadily looking worse for black suddenly looks very promising",
        "22... Bb7 23. Qf3 Bg7": "Consolidating pieces",
        "24. Qf2": "Increases the pressure on the d4 pawn",
        "24... Qxc2": "Taking a pawn whilst preventing Nxd4",
        "25. Rac1 Qxe4": "Gets another pawn whilst still preventing the capture",
        "26. Rc7": "A logical move, allowing white to double rooks and increase the pressure on black",
        "26... Ba8 27. Ng3": "Again, the initiative has now returned to white, but the pressure is still great not to lose momentum as material is heavily in black's favour",
        "27... Qe3": "A catastrophic blunder, forgetting the d4 pawn was pinned",
        "28. Qxe3 dxe3 29. Rxd6": "The punishment takes place, and black is temporarily down in material.\n\nBlack has the fork at Be5, but after Re-d7 Bxd6 Rxd6 Re8 Rd1 it looks hard to convert the passed pawn, and material would be even again.\n\nI am surprised at the resignation here, it seems that drawing chances at the very least are high, but I may have missed further tactical wizardry that is above my level!"
