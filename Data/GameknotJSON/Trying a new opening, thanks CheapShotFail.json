    "moves": {
        "1. Nc3": "Hey hey all, I hosted a game as black and got a player who started with nc3. i dont even remember the last time i faced someone who started with this. shows how often i face this.",
        "1... d5": "and so i told myself ill try a new opening i discovered this week in an Annotation by CheapShotFail rated 1900+ that he called a dutch stonewall,  i did 0 research to this opening and have only seen his annotation with it but i did remember what the basic start up looked like and decided to go for it, ",
        "2. d4 c6": "already there are 2 differences from the game CSF annotated. first white placed his knight in front of c2 before playing c4 and i decided to play c6 instead of e6.",
        "3. Bf4": "hmm another big difference in the game i saw the white player chose to seal his DSB in by playing e3.",
        "3... f5": "i still decide to move forward with the formation and choose to play f5 before e6 since my opponent didnt play his e pawn.",
        "4. e3": "opens the way for his queen and lsb",
        "4... e6": "and so the stonewall formation is almost complete",
        "5. Qd3": "hmm curious reply promotes queen right away. i guess he will long castle. this delights me this opening seems to make for a strong queen side attack,",
        "5... Nf6": "develop knight",
        "6. O-O-O": "anticipated long castle",
        "6... Be7": "heading towards my castle.  another minor difference from CSF's annotation. he was able to put his DSB on d6 and also the fact white never took the time to castle in his annotation.   i prefer Be7 to a early Bb4 i can hold out my attack til i develop a bit more was my thought",
        "7. Be5": "what i noticed this game is that whites DSB being out there is stuck to the e5 and f4 squares renduring him Very weak compared to blacks DSB having a long diagonal towards whites king.",
        "7... O-O": "and so castle!",
        "8. Nf3": "opponent also further develops",
        "8... Nbd7": "i decide to reinforce my knight and now to quote CSF \"obvious development is complete\" here i also saw i could play ne4 to double pawn his C file or gain a rook and the f pawn if he doesnt defend appropriately. or even better a knight for a pawn if he would be foolish enough to exchange his knight on e4.  double pawning him on the c file greatly compliments my DSB and queen. man this opening has Very nice attacking potential im loving this already.",
        "9. g3": "maybe looking to develop his LSB is what i thought",
        "9... Ne4": "onwards with plan",
        "10. Qe2": "decides for the double pawn",
        "10... Nxc3 11. bxc3 Ba3+": "and so i decide to strike right away. maybe this is too early i dont know its my first time trying this opening. it felt right.  i believe CSF tried moving his pawns first. i told myself i could race the B and A pawns up there if he doesnt let me checkmate him.",
        "12. Kd2": "forced. kb1 leads to mate with Qb6check",
        "12... b5": "and so onwards towards that crippled foundation and crunched army ",
        "13. Rb1": "hmm didnt think he would choose that square for his rook. but i see the strenght in it.  i take note that i can swap out his DSB anytime i want. but as i noticed before. his DSB is very weak. taking my knight off of d7 and allowing his knight access to e5 is potentially dangerous for my pawns. im making a note of that in writing cause i told myself i would swap out knights if he uses the tempo to send him there. but end up making a greedy move not listening to myself.",
        "13... Qa5": "so i thought it forces me to send my queen now. i was maybe hoping i could send my a pawn first but it would take too long. or i was also maybe looking to push with the c pawn. but those all looked more complicated.",
        "14. Bf4": "makes way for his knight. that DSB has been stuck on the 2 same squares all game long!",
        "14... b4": "and so forward. maybe this was a bit early. reinforcing with the rook wasnt possible due to his DSB. but i told myself the check recapture has a time gain enough if he takes. and if he pass his pawn thats ultimately fatal",
        "15. Rb3": "hmm unanticpated, but i have to say i didnt really see what he was going to throw at me to stop me from coming down anymore. so most of his moves were\"unanticpated\" out of shear overconfidence at this stage.",
        "15... bxc3+": "give a check this i saw as a way to change which pawn will go up. as i told myself my A and B pawns will be the racers. him having played the moves he played from when i decided that has now solidified that my A pawn is the passed pawn",
        "16. Kd1": "if he took with rook it was a dropped rook with Bb4 to follow",
        "16... Bb2": "so reinforce the C pawn. protect my DSB and cover the A1 square. plus allow acces for my queen to take the A pawn out. force queen exchanges or a checkmate if my opponent doesnt allow the exchange.",
        "17. Ne5": "i was supposed to take out this knight with my knight like i had told myself to do! it wouldve put that DSB to sleep Sorta. i saw that he might try  in him recapturing with his DSB and then sending his queen to h5 and i saw a nice nifty line \tNe5\tNxe5\n18.\tBxe5\tQxa2\n19.\tQh5\tQb1+\n20.\tKe2\tQxc2+\n21.\tKf3\tQe4+\n22.\tKe2\tBa6+\n23.\tKe1\tQb1+\n24.\tQd1\tc2  but assuming that his queen would go to h5 to make room for his king was too much of a Guess or wildshot. and i greedily played Qxa2 cause i saw this as getting his rook for my pawn and taking a lead.",
        "17... Qxa2 18. Ke1": "protects his king. i can trade out queens at any time now.  i still shouldve traded knights out now but had completely \"let him go\" to play my pawn push. and i also kept looking to see if i could attack his queen with my LSB but saw nothing viable.",
        "18... a5": "and so forward with that dangerous knight behind us!",
        "19. Nxc6": "oops! well im still up material. ",
        "19... a4": "onwards!",
        "20. Rb4": "good enough!",
        "20... Qb1+": "queens off",
        "21. Qd1 Qxd1+ 22. Kxd1 a3": "try to stop this buddy!",
        "23. Ke2": "step in the right direction. but still gonna cost ya your rook.",
        "23... a2 24. Ne7+": "bah.! you get my LSB fine. ill take it, my F rook on the c file Serves way better than my LSB at this stage.",
        "24... Kh8 25. Rb6": "oops!?  maybe trying for some sort of swindle. i see he attacks my E pawn. and lets me get my Queen didnt take the time to see if he has a checkmate on me before i get one on him. but he would have a knight Rook and DSB VERY close to my king. but wait a minute. that square is attacked by my knight...  had this been a game in life with my opponent in front of me. i wouldve been obliged to promote my queen and find out what would ensue. cause i had clicked my pawn had a red square promoted to a1 and was about to click submit. so piece touched piece played ><",
        "25... Nxb6": "but this is the internet >< i dont need a queen now with a free rook. and getting my pawn still costs him his other rook.  opponent resigns.   i think this was just a blunder but thanks though CheapShotFail for turning me onto this Very fun opening. although the game ended with a blunder i think i was going win comfortably once my pawn reached the 1st rank next turn. had he moved his LSB instead.  all comments appreciated!"
