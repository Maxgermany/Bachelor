        "1. d4 d5 2. c4": "This is a queens gambit position. If black chooses to defend against it, they could pay Nf6, C6, or if they wanted to, E6",
        "2... dxc4": "But in most cases, they take it, whitch is what happens in this game. E3 is your respose, attacking the pawn, making the best respose for black being B5",
        "3. e3": "Another version of the same gambit would have been Qa4+ attacking the pawn, gaining it back. ",
        "3... b5 4. a4": "A4 lures him in. If he takes the pawn, C4 and A4 are now undefended for a free pawn.",
        "4... c6": "He doesn't want to take it, so he responds in such a way, making a forced gain in 2 moves.",
        "5. axb5 cxb5": "The next move is the best. It garuntees that you get 4 points or more. Attacking at the undefended, and almost imposoble to defend rook in the corner: A8",
        "6. Qf3": "...Qf3",
        "6... Nc6": "There are 2 ways to do what Nc6 did. (Alternatives, 1.... Bb7 2. QxB7, Nd7, or 1.... Nc6 2. Qxc6, Bd7, also alternative, but that is what he does.)",
        "7. Qxc6+": "Check",
        "7... Bd7 8. Qb7": "Now there is a doube attack on a7. He could only stop it by Qc8 or Qb8. Qb6 wouldn't work after, 9.Qxb6, axb6 10.Rxa8, and I get ahead."
