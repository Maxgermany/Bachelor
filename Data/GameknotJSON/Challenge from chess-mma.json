        "1. e4": "was a game I played against one of my best friends and it started like a regular game by me. I love to start with e4 since that it the most simple move that opens up 2 pieces and give you control of the center ",
        "1... Nc6": "as he went out with Nc6 its a opening I am not used too so I won't lie I used the Gameknot database to see which move fits best and what my choices are.",
        "2. Nf3": "and that is yet a simple response and I wasn't even sure that it was the best move.  ",
        "2... Nf6": "ok now he places his second knight on the best place on the board for it. and I need to protect my pawn",
        "3. e5": "so since he didn't move out his pawn yet I decided that it will be good to advance and keep it safe at the same time and getting into his territory is never a bad thing right? ",
        "3... Ng4": "ok I am trying to think how will he benefit from it?",
        "4. d4": "lets get more support and open up the black bishop and control more of the center!",
