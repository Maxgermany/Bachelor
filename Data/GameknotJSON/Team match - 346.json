    "moves": {
        "1. e4 Nc6 2. d4 e5": "by this move 2...e5 , the position turns to be the Scottish opening , 2...d6 or 2...d5 are playable here .",
        "3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4": "the idea is to make pressure on whites central pawns e4 and d4 , the pine on c3 makes pressure on e4 pawn and blacks e5 pawn and Nc6 pressuring on my d4 pawn . however the pressure on d4 is not serius because my d4 pawn is well protected by my Nf3 and Qd1 . and if i want , i can take on e5 .which i did in the game .",
        "5. Nxe5 Nxe5": "5....Nxe4 is not  a good idea because 6.Qf3! (attacking f7 with mate and the Ne4 on the same time )-Nf6 and black wasted time , or 6...Bxc3+.7.bxc3-Nf6 will be worse because black lost his bishops pare and wasted time .",
        "6. dxe5 Nxe4 7. Qd4": "good move , developing my queen to central and active position which attacks blacks DSB on b4 and the black knight on e4 and protects my Nc3, this move all so forces black to lose his bishops pare .",
        "7... Bxc3+": "of course not 7... Nxc3??.8.Qxb4 and  the black knight is trapped .",
        "8. bxc3 Ng5 9. Bd3": "Bc4 or Be2 was all so not bad moves but, i wanted to make blacks h7 pawn as a arget after black 0-0 for my pieces .",
        "9... Ne6": "the miss place of the black knight causing black to move again with the same place , but at least its takes of the knight from a hitt square g5 which my DSB is attacking it . and attacks the white queen on d4 which is buying some time for black to develop his peices .",
        "10. Qe3": "good move , the white queen remains in its active position which takes space advantage and still controls the center . the block on my DSB doesn't bother me because anyway , i thought to develop it to a3 which controls a1-f8 diagonal .",
        "10... d6": "good move . the idea is to exchange piecs as more as you can when, your opponent makes pressure on you , and if its opposite try to avoid the exchange for keeping the pressure .",
        "11. O-O": "white placed his king on safe place and preparing Re1 or d1 to activet  the white rooks .",
        "11... dxe5 12. Qxe5 Qd6": "the activity of the white queen seems to bother the black , and as i mentiond earlier , exchanging pieces will be for black much better chances to release him self .",
        "13. Qe4": "good move, he white avoides the exchange , and the idea of 13.Qe4! is to avoid moves like b6 with the idea of Bb7 and it is all so pines the Ne6 which is one of the develped pieces of black .",
        "13... c6": "black  trys again to exchange the queens by 14...Qd5 or even , after 4...0-0 black can maneouver his knight to d5 by Ne6-c7-d5 and get some active game of its own .",
        "14. Rd1": "good move , white is going to controlls the open files with his heavy piesec (the queen and the rooks ) ,  the white queen controling the e file , the Rf controlls the d- line and Ra will move to b1 and take over the open B file.",
        "14... Bd7 15. Rb1 O-O-O": "black probebly didnt want to 0-0 simpley because of Qxh7#, and any moves like g6 will be great target for my white DSB because of the weak dark squares of the blacks king side . anyway the position of black is very complecated and he must defend well , to survive this game .",
        "16. Qa4": "there is no need for my queen to stay on e4 , anytime black will play Rhe8 and any retreat of the black knight can be unpleasant for me , there for after black 0-0-0 the white queen attacks the a7 pawn and wishes to make some weaknesses on the blacks queen side , black must play very carefully now .",
        "16... Qb8": "mistake , the black queens retreats to defend the king , however it puts its self to horrible death trap , because its shorts the escaping squares for its own king ,better was .21...c5.20.Qxa7-Bc6.21.c4-Rhe8 .22.Bd2-g6.23.f3-Qb8 . the position is still worse for black , however the black king can breath a little bit . if 21...a6.22.Rxb7!!-Nc5!.23.Rb6!-Nxa4 .24. Bxa6+-Kc7.25.Rb7+-Kc8.26.Rxd6 and white in wining position . and not!! 24...Kxb7??.25.Qxa6+-Kb8.25.Bf4!-Nxf4.26.Qb6+-Ka8.27.Qa5+Kb8.28.Rb1+-Qb4.29.Rxb4+-Kc8.29.Ba6#. if 25...Qxf4?.26.Qb6+Ka8.27.Qa5+-Kb7(or b8 doesnt matter ).28.Rb1+-Qb4.29.Rxb4+-Kc824.Ba6#.",
        "17. Ba6": "great move , black cannot capture whites LSB because of the b7 pawn is pined , white now threats 18.Rxb7 with very strong attack .",
        "17... Nc5": "black trying with evrything he have to defend from whites strong attack , this is very good move , attacking the the white queen on a4 and the LSB on a6 and defending the b7  pawn on the same time , however i found very nice combination which even a great move Nc5! doesnt help so much .",
        "18. Rxb7": "great move , black cant capture the queen on a4 because of18.Rxd7+-Qb7.19.Bxb7+-Kb8.20.Bf4#,",
        "18... Nxb7": "the only way .",
        "19. Bf4": "another good move , the retreat of the black Queen to a8 any way will lead to her doom, after 20.Qa5! threating invantible mate on c7.20...Qb8 forced.21.Bxb8-Kxb8 and white will have easy win .",
        "19... c5": "black doesnt give up! , another good move ,blacks LSB attacking the white queen on a4 and if 21.Qb3?-Be6 threating mate on d1 and attacking Qb3, and if 21.Qa5?-Qxf4! and white lost , i realised that black wants me to reatret my A file whitch will probebly finish my attack . i found another way to keep the strong attack ,(i dont have a time to passive moves ,)",
        "20. Qe4": "maybe the wining move , now  my queen is out from danger ,and i am avoiding moves  like Bc6 or Be6  because deadly attack on c6, and if the black retreats to a8(with his queen)after.20.Qe4black wont be able to stop the mate on c7. the idea is to move my Queen to a square  which defend my DSB on f4, attack c6 square if the black LSB will move, and i will have the option to attack c7 from Qe5 after the retreat of the black queen .",
        "20... Rhe8": "black see the the threat and  and attacks again my queen .",
        "21. Qd5": "but now its too late for black , Black stiil cant move his LSB , if .21...Ba4.22.Qxd8+-Rxd8.23.Rxd8+-Kxd8.24.Bxb8 and black without material and will lose . and if 21...Be6??.22.Qc6+-Qc7.23.Qxc7#. white all so threats 22.Qxc5+ -Bc6.23.Qxc6+-Qc7.24.Qxc7#.",
        "21... Re6": "if 21...Qa8??.22.Qxc5+-Bc6.23.Qxc6#.  black wishes to break the pine on b7 and a void some how the mate threat , 22.Qxc5+-Rc6! and black can be saved , however after the last black move , i had no attentions to capture the c5 pawn , and i simply won his queen . its falls to say that 22...Re6 was a blunder , the whites attack was to heavy , and i must admit heroic defense by the black , well done !!",
        "22. Bxb8 Rxa6 23. Qe5": "and black resigns , the activity of the white queen is to much for black , thank you and i hope you enjoyed the game ."
