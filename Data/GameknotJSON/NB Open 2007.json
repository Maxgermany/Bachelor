        "1. Nf3": "NB Open 2007.",
        "1... c5 2. g3 d6 3. Bg2 Nc6 4. O-O e5 5. d3 Be7 6. e4": "My favorite...the KIA.  It isn't all that strong against Sicilians without black playing e6 but at least it is solid and avoids the 'book lines' most Sicilian players hope to reach.",
        "6... Bg4 7. h3 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Nf6 9. Nc3 a6 10. Bg5 Nd7 11. Bxe7 Nxe7": "I think he captured with the knight so he could get rid of the knight I am about to put on the d5 outpost.  However, in doing so I am able to capture his knight with my e pawn.   That pawn will be almost impossible to remove.  Once he pushes his b and f pawns I'll have an outpost on c6 and more importantly on e6.  It takes me a while to plop a piece on e6 but I do. ",
        "12. Nd5 Nxd5 13. exd5 O-O 14. c4": "I liked this pawn formation.  It is solid.  ",
        "14... f5 15. Bg2 Rf6 16. Qh5": "I'm hoping to provoke some pawn weaknesses.",
        "16... Nf8 17. Qg5 h6 18. Qd2 Ng6 19. b4": "Black is still quite solid on the kingside so now I probe the Queenside a bit.",
        "19... b6 20. a4 a5 21. bxa5 Rxa5 22. Rfb1": "I liked this move and I don't think my opponent expected it. ",
        "22... f4": "22...f4?\r\n\r\nI was waiting for this pawn to move for a long time.",
        "23. Be4": "His position is starting to have lots of holes.  It's time to bring the bishop to life and expolit those outposts!",
        "23... Ra6 24. Kh2": "I saw a 'neat tactical trap' so I played a poor move hoping he'd fall for it.  I should really stop doing that so often!  Now my king is less active and less able to aid in defence.\r\n\r\n",
        "24... fxg3+ 25. fxg3 Qf8 26. Kg2 Ne7 27. Rbf1 Nc8 28. Rxf6 Qxf6 29. Rf1": "Gaining the file.",
        "29... Qd8 30. Bf5": "Now that I own the file I can reposition the bishop even deeper into his camp.  Destination...e6.",
        "30... Ne7 31. Be6+ Kh8 32. Rf7": "Attacking the g pawn.",
        "32... Rxa4 33. Qd1": "The d1/h5 diagonal is calling my name.",
        "33... Ra2+ 34. Kg1 g5": "34..g5??\r\n\r\nAnd that's one hole too many.",
        "35. Qh5 Ra1+ 36. Kf2 Ra2+ 37. Ke3 Ng8 38. Qg6": "Black resigned here.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with my play in this game.  I suppose I should really pick up the white side of the Sicilian since the KIA isn't as effective against Sicilians without e6 by Black.  All comments are welcome."
