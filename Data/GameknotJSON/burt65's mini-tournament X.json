        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be3": "a good positional move but is only effective if white plays an early c4 and intended to play on the queenside. In that case he can setup a powerful bind on d5 if black plays Nc6. Bg5 is a more active move. ",
        "6... e5": "one of the consequences of playing a semi off tempo move like be3 is that it allows black to gain momentium via moves like this one. ",
        "7. Nb3 Be6 8. f3": "another solid reply but again how does it challenge black? This is why I do not play into the najdorf lines as I think white acheives very little from it. ",
        "8... Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O a5 11. Bb5 Nc6 12. Bxc6": "?? this is bad as it is hard to see why you would want to give another centre pawn to black! 12. Kb1 Na7 11. Be2 would give you a slight advantage in space. \r\n\r\nIf he plays 13. ...Nc6 again you can create better position for your pieces with \r\n14. Nc1 Nb4 15. Nd3!? b5 16. g4! Nxd3 17. Bxd3 ans white is slightly better. ",
        "12... bxc6 13. Na4 c5 14. Qc3": "you are already falling behind in space and central control so you must act quickly. your best chance is the counter 14. g4 which leads to very unclear lines. ",
        "14... Bd7 15. Nbxc5 dxc5 16. Bxc5": "?? the idea of exchanging to eliminate attacking pieces is ok but not so soon you are a pawn down so. \r\n\r\n16. Qxe5!? Re8 17. Nc5 Qb6 18. Qd4 and you have some activity aleast. ",
        "16... Bxc5 17. Nxc5 Qe7 18. Nxd7 Nxd7 19. Qc7 Qg5+": "After this white has nothing to do but wait for the final checkmate to come. ",
