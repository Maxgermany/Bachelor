        "2... dxc4": "The best way to get freedom for Black's pieces. If the gambit is declined, Black finds himself in a very cramped state, especially with the Orthodox Defense. The drawback is the disunity of the Pawn structure and the danger of White being able to seize the center with the thrust P-K4.",
