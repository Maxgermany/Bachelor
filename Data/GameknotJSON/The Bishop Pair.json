        "1. e4": "Not many people play e5 now. ",
        "1... c5": "Yes, the origanal is c5 or e5",
        "2. c4": "A very nervous hedgehog system (English)",
        "2... Nc6": "Is this the correct knight?",
        "3. Nc3 d6": "I don't like d6/d3 if the bishop is not out, otherwise its fine.",
        "4. Nf3": "White quite likes developing.",
        "4... g6": "Black is already starting to weaken his kingside if he ever castles kingside (O-O)",
        "5. d4": "This move is fine but the is a little scent of danger/pressure.",
        "5... f5": "Black is simply starting to rot his kingside.",
        "6. dxc5": "Now White's structure is a little bit better.",
        "6... fxe4": "Well, now white can reply with Nxe4, also protecting his c5 pawn. Whatever black does, white will be a pawn up.",
        "7. Nxe4": "Exactly.",
        "7... Nf6": "This sounds strange.",
        "8. Nxf6+": "Now black has got a weak castling side whichever way he castles, he will end up in a weak side,",
        "8... exf6": "Now black has two weak pawns (or 3).",
        "9. cxd6": "I would think white needs to capture.But Qe2+ is maybe better.",
        "9... Qxd6": "If a player is stronger than you, I think it is good to exchange queens. White should not exchange queens just yet and keep attacking.",
        "10. Qe2+": "That seems just right.",
        "10... Qe7": "I knew it. Black wants to exchange.",
        "11. c5": "??/!? Why make this move while White has other brilliant attacking plans like Be3/f4?",
        "11... Qxe2+": "? Now white can capture with Bxe2 and then White will win a tempo with O-O",
        "12. Bxe2 Bxc5": "See. Now the pieces are equal.",
        "13. O-O": "But black has terrible shape on the kingside.",
        "13... Bg4": "I usally agree that knights are weaker than bishops (hearing the words of 'Knight after Bishops) so I think it is best to ignore.",
        "14. Re1": "!! Now that is good! After Bxf3, Bxf3+ and white wins.",
        "14... Bxf3": "Uh-oh for Black. Either Bxf3+ Be7 Bxc6+, King moves out of check, or Bxf3+ Ne7 Bxb7 and white wins.",
        "15. Bxf3+": "Yes. And it is good to keep track of checks",
        "15... Ne7": "?! Not so good",
        "16. Bxb7": "A Fine attack but then Rb8 changes nothing.",
        "16... Rb8": "As expected.",
        "17. Bc6+": "Where the knight would've been.",
        "17... Kf7": "Now the knight is free to capture the bishop cuz the knight's not pinned anymore.",
        "18. Bf3": "What a waste of moves.",
        "18... Rhe8 19. Re2": "Yes. Getting rid of the risk that Bxf2+ might happen.",
        "19... h6": " !?",
        "20. Bf4": "Tackling the rook.",
        "20... Rb4 21. Bd2": "Now it looks quite fine.    ",
        "21... Rc4": "Bad square. Terrible.",
        "22. Rxe7+": "!! There was the sacrifice that was brillaint. Whichever way black accepts it, white will always win a piece. Can you guess how?",
        "22... Rxe7": "Ah. That's one way of escaping.",
        "23. Bd5+": "Yes, of course. The nifty, rare bishop fork that never really occours. Well played for White. We never often have bishop forks, only Queen & Knight Forks.",
        "23... Kf8": "Common square for castlers.",
        "24. Bxc4": "And now white swoops in a piece ahead.",
        "24... Re5": "? Black is being careless.",
        "25. Bxh6+ Ke7 26. Kf1": "?!",
        "26... Bb4": "?! Also A dubious carless move. Not thinking what white would play next.",
        "27. f4": "What has changed? Yes, white has unpinned the f2 pawn and sent it flying towards f4. Attacking the lonley rook.",
        "27... Ra5 28. a3": "Chasing away the bishop",
        "28... Bc5 29. Re1+": "Getting the rook out.",
        "29... Kd7 30. Be6+": "Adding another piece.",
        "30... Kd6 31. f5": "A good sacrifice.",
        "31... gxf5": "But that could be declined. g5 solves the problem.",
        "32. Bf4+": "That was the aim of the pawn sacrifice.",
        "32... Ke7 33. Bxf5+": "White is five points up but we cannot be sure if he is going to win or not.",
        "33... Kf8 34. Bd7 Bd4": "Silly, Silly, Silly move.",
        "35. Bh6+": "I understand.",
        "35... Kg8 36. Re4": "That is not the real aim.",
        "36... Bxb2 37. Rg4+ Kh7 38. Bd2": "Again, not the real aim.",
        "38... Rxa3 39. Bf5+": "Now white is a whole bishop up.",
        "39... Kh8 40. Bb4 Ra1+ 41. Kf2 Ba3": "?/?!  Bad but also dubious.",
        "42. Bc3": "Aiming for mate.",
        "42... Ra2+": "Good move.",
        "43. Kg3 Rxg2+": "Forced sacrifice to escape mate.",
        "44. Kxg2 Bb2": "What's the point of the sacrifice. Much better was Be6.",
        "45. Bxb2": "Easy",
        "45... a6 46. Bxf6#": "Checkmate. Sorry, Black."
