        "1. e4": "This is a team match played last year which I judged interesting since I introduced a new line in the closed Ruy Lopez (10. ... d5) and since it led to a very interesting tactical final combination.\n\nI really hope that you, dear GK player, can enjoy this match!",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "The well-known Spanish (Ruy Lopez) opening...",
        "3... a6": "... and the most played answer to the third white's move.",
        "4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7": "The closed variation. Black could also play 5. ... Nxe4, a move which usually lead to more tactic games. This move is quiet, but we'll see that is not always so.",
        "6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3 O-O 9. h3 Na5 10. Bc2": "Until this move is all coded, the classical line in the closed Spanish. But here I introduced a very interesting move...",
        "10... d5": "10. ... d5!?\nBlack offers a pawn, breaking the center. A brave move, which can somewhat remind the Marshall gambit (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. 0-0 Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 00 8. c3 d5!?). Here black has already moved the d-pawn on his 7th move, and now is pushing it again. Perhaps someone can think it can be a strategical blunder, since is a good idea not to move twice the same piece in the opening without a good reason, but everyone knows that these rules must be considered \"cum grano salis\".",
        "11. exd5": "Of course, 11. Nxe5 is playable and black can play 11. ... dxe4 12. Bxe4 Nxe4 13. Rxe4 Bb7 and black has a good development and control of the center, which seems to compensate the pawn.",
        "11... e4": "Black forces white to move his knight, protecting his pawn from the rook and aiming to take the d-pawn.",
        "12. Ng5": "It seems playable 12. Bxe4, a calmer move.",
        "12... Nxd5 13. Nxe4 f5": "This is the key move in this variation. Black can push his f-pawn without loss of time, creating a very serious threat to white's King.",
        "14. Ng3": "Forced since g3 is the only square where the knight would not be threaten by black pieces.",
        "14... f4": "Black can push again his pawn, in a dangerous bayonet attack.",
        "15. Ne4": "White has several retreats for his knight different from 15. Ne4, which I am not going to analyze deeply:\n15. Nh5: seems an aggressive move, since it menaces the f-pawn and the knight looks the pawn at g7 which seems to be somewhat appetizing.\n15. Nf1, 15. Nh1: passive moves, especially the second, but playable.\n15. Ne2?!: after the expected 15. ... f3, will lead to another transfer. I think is not a good idea.",
        "15... f3": "So, the poor foot soldier with his bayonet reached the castle and knocked at the door, and the warriors defending the white's King must take a decision about how defend his lord.",
        "16. g4": "16. g4? may seem a playable move but, as we'll see in the next moves, is a mistake.\nPerhaps white can ignore the menace and allow the black to take in g2, or defend with 16. g3, which seems better than g4.",
        "16... Bd6": "Consequent, for two good reason: it exploits the weakness on the b8-h2 diagonal and frees the action on the d8-h4 diagonal for the black Queen, which probably wants to cheat with the other King... what a bad behavior.",
        "17. Nxd6": "Unfortunately for white, he can only try to amend one weakness a time.",
        "17... Qh4": "So the white's situation seems to became critical.",
        "18. Re4": "What else? The threat of Qxh3 is tangible, and other moves would not prevent that. After an eventually 18. ~ Qxh3 only 19. Qxf3 would \"save\" the King, with the Queen giving her life in order to let his husband not to be captured too soon. Obviously, after 18. Re4, white can answer with 19. Qf1 to 18. ... Qxh3.\n\nTo free the first rank and the access of f1-square to Queen, could white have also played 18. Re5?",
        "18... Nf4": "Here, kitty kitty kitty!\nBlack is threatening a nice mate: 19. ~ Nxh3  20. Kh1 Nxf2   (20. Kh2 doesn't change the combination, but the double check is always an interesting event!) 21. Kg1 Qg3  22. Kf1 Qg2  23. Ke1 Qg1#.\n\nIn order to answer to the question of the previous move: if white played 18. Re5, after 18. ... Nf4 the mate threat is the same. 19. Ne4 would protect the f2 weak point, but would not be enough. 19. ... Qxh3 followed by 20. ... Qg2# is unavoidable!\n\nSo, it is clearly visible that the only move can save is 19. Rxf4.",
        "19. Rxf4": "Forced.",
        "19... Rxf4": "Consequent. The threat of Qxh3 is always here.",
        "20. Qf1": "Forced, again. 20. Ne4 doesn't save, i.e.: 20. ... Qxh3 21. Qf1 Rxg4  22. Ng3 Rxg3  23. fxg3 Qxg3  24. Kh1 Bh3 with an unavoidable mate.\n\nThe weakest point, h3, is now protected...",
        "20... Rxg4+": "... or not? Black has to destroy white's ultimate defense, at the cost of all his pieces!\n20. ... Bxg4?! wouldn't be effective, since the idea is to intensify the pressure on h3, so the bishop must stay on the board.",
        "21. hxg4": "Forced.",
        "21... Qxg4+": "Would be white able to mate the King with the Queen, a bishop and a pawn?",
        "22. Kh2": "22. Kh1 would not change the situation. The only reason of these checks is to put the Queen and the bishop in a proper position.",
        "22... Qh4+ 23. Kg1 Bh3": "Here we are.\nIf white wants to save the Queen, he will lose the King (24. Q~ Qg4  25. Kh~ Qg2#). The game is over.",
        "24. Nf5": "This is the only good move, since the knight threatens the Queen and is ready to jump in g3. Of course, the Queen is lost, but white can't save her in any way.",
        "24... Qg5+ 25. Ng3 Bxf1": "Does white King has enough strength to avenge his wife?",
        "26. Na3": "No, he hasn't. It would be useless.",
        "26... Re8": "White resigns.\nThanks to mefis for the game, I think it is one of the nicest I played here on Gameknot.\n\nI also think it is relevant since it suggest an interesting line in the Ruy Lopez, that one with the apparently odd 10. ... d5. Comments are welcome!"
