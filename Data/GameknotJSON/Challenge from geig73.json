        "4... Bf5 5. c4 Nc6": "Need to still check the DB if this is a good/right move, but given the history with me it would been a good/right move.",
        "6. cxd5": "Again something \"out of the norm\" for me :)\nBut the \"best I believe given 5 .. Nc6",
        "6... Nb4": "Given the pawn on d6, it's the wrong order of moves, ",
        "7. Qa4+": "I believe this was the move that swinged the game.",
        "7... Qd7": "yeah, since you can't do Nc6, but still might've been \"beter\"",
        "8. Qxb4": "I considered 8 Bb5, but the c6 , 9 dxc6 Nxc6 and the advantage is gone.",
        "8... O-O-O": "This also wasn't such a good move, as there wasn't much support for a7.\nI would've played b6, followed soon by e5, attacking Q on b4, and pushing to e4",
        "9. Qa5 Kb8": "Not a6, as I would've attacked (in my norm ;^) with 10. Bxa6, bxa6 11. Qxa6 , positional advantage, still two pawns ahead",
        "10. Nc3": "Needed to get \"some\" protection for d5, but also needed badly to start developing",
        "10... b6": "not \"bad\" .. attempting to get Queen away.\nAt this point I'd rather play 10...Qd6 and following 11. Nb5 Qb6 preventing mate.\nI believe this move just tipped the scale badly in my favour. ",
        "11. Qa6 Nxd5": "a tad late/early??\nRather 11...Qc8 followed by QxQ or Qb7\nor even  11...c6 to prevent the mate attack ",
        "12. Ne5": "12 Nb5 would've been fooled with 12.. c6 and advantage lost",
        "12... Qe6": "I had conditional moves ready for 12.. Qc6 13 Nc6  Ka8 14 Qxa7#\nand 12 .. Qd6 13 Nb5 Qb4  14 Bd2 and then I'll have a checkmate coming in the next two moves..\nat this stage geig73 made this move ;)\n",
        "13. Nb5": "can't prevent the coming Qxa7...",
