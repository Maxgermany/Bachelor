        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. f3": "the idea of this variation with the move 5. f3 without Be3 or Bc4 is , not showing black where the LSB will move on the future, white can play 6.Bc4-g6.7.Be3-Bg7.8.Qd2-Nc6.9.Nc3-Qa510.0-0-0, and go to the Yugoslavian attack or 6.Be3-g6.7.Qd2-Bg7.8.Nc3-0-0.9.0-0-0 -d5 and so on ... , actually this variation as we saw gives white to choose the variation that he wants to play ,however black doesn't need to change his game plane so, it doesn't effect to much for me . there is another interesting thing here that white didn't play Nc3 yet so , its also big question where the knight b1 will move , however ,pieces development a quick as possible is one of the main keys in the game , especially in this variation .",
        "5... g6 6. Be3 Bg7 7. Qd2 Nc6 8. Bb5": "i don't like this move , the pine on c6 doesn't effect so much on black, i can easily block that pine with 8....Bd7! which i also developed my LSB on the same time , in the future i can run away(with the move 8...a6 ) his LSB or force him to exchange on c6 and i will get Bishops pare or if he retreats to a4 or c4,e2 , doesn't matter ,  white will lose some time on this unnecessary move 8.Bb5?!, developing a  pieces its not enough , its need to developed to the right spots on the board . better was 8.Nc3 or 8.Bc4.",
        "8... Bd7 9. Nc3 O-O 10. O-O-O a6": "the miss placed whites LSB on b5 gives white tow uncomfortable choices , either he exchanges on c6 and stays without his bishop pare or , he retreats with his bishop and lose time that would harm him later on the  game .",
        "11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. Bc4 Rb8": "good move , black enters his rook to the game which placed in the open B file , with the help of the black DSB on g7 , black may start very dangerouse attack on the whites king .",
        "13. Bb3": "white wishes to close blacks B file which is open , and may lead to attack on the white king .",
        "13... Qa5": "good move , the  black queen developed to very acctive spot which it can attack the white king , and controlls  the 5th rank which avoid whites contraplay on the king side by advanceing his g and h pawns on the king side .",
        "14. Na4": "white wishes to exchange the queens because of the black queens active position , but its a mistake , he should try to exchange the DSBs  by the move 14.Bh6 as soon as posibele , or better try of queens exchange was 14.Kb1 with the threat .15.Nd5 if 15...Qxd2.16.Nxe7+!Kh8.17.Rxd2 or 15...Qd8 and the black queen leaves its active posiyion from a5 and thats allowd white to start his pawns g and h advance to the attack on the black king in the future .",
        "14... Qc7 15. Nc3": "after the retreat of the black queen , there is nothing to do for the white knight on the rim.",
        "15... c5": "the idea is to avoid whites Bd4which will placed him in good diagonal . ",
        "16. Nd5": "its mistake , the white knight on c3 was one of the main diffenders of the white king , exchanging the knights will opens the deadly diagonale h8-a1 and cause very dangereouse attack on the white king .",
        "16... Nxd5 17. Qxd5": "the open B file and the long diagonal h8-a1 speaks for it self , if 18.Bxd5??-Bxg2+ .19.kb1-Bc3+ and white losing his queen and the game .",
        "17... Be6": "good move ,now the LSB takes an active position which it makes  pressure on the g8-a2 diagonal , another idea is that after the white queen retreats to g5 black plays 18...c4 attacking the whites LSB on b3 and after 19.Ba4 -Bxb2+.20.Kb1-Bf6+ and wins a queen and the game , the same idea happens  if 17.Qd2 . the butty is that the black pieces corporate together for the attack on the4 white king .",
        "18. Qd3": "blunder , white loses his Bishop and under heavy attack . any other move didn't makes any better position for white . if 18.Qd2-c4!! if 19.Ba4??-Bxb2+!!.20.Kb1-Bc3+ and win a queen . and if 19.Bxc4-Bxb2+.20.Kb1-Bc3+.... and last 18.Qg5-c4.19.Ba4-Bxb2+.20.Kd2-Qa5+ and win a piece , there fore white resigns ....., thank you and i hope you enjoyed the game .",
