        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. Nxd4 Nxd4": "This is bad. Just count how many pieces each side has developed before and after the exchange. Correct was 4...Nf6.",
        "5. Qxd4": "The queen and pawn give White total dominance over the centre.",
        "5... h6": "Unnecessary, but the obvious 5...Nf6 doesn't work either because of 6.e5. 5...d6 looks like the best option.",
        "6. Bc4 Qf6": "It's fine if he takes it, but if he doesn't it obstructs the knight. It's usually unwise to bring out your queen so early in the game.",
        "7. e5 Qf5 8. Qd5 c6": "8...Ne7 developing a piece, looks better. Then after ...Ng6 (or ...Nc6) and ...Be7 you wll be able to castle. 8...c6 creates a hole on d6 which White exploits later.",
        "9. Qd2": "A strange place to put the queen!",
        "9... Qe4+ 10. Qe2 Qxg2 11. Rf1 Qxh2 12. Nc3 Bb4 13. Bd2 Ne7 14. O-O-O Qh3": "I don't see the point of this. You really should be thinking about getting your other bishop out and getting your king to safety.",
        "15. Rfh1 Qf5 16. Rh5 g5 17. Ne4": "White could have played 17.Bxg5.",
        "17... Bxd2+ 18. Rxd2": "Although he is two pawns down, White has a winning position. All his pieces are active and he is on the verge of a breakthrough.",
        "18... O-O": "I think there were better moves. 18...Qf4 or 18...Kd8.",
        "19. Rxh6 Ng6 20. Rd6": "20.Nf6  forces him to sacrifice his queen or he will be mated next move.",
        "20... Kg7 21. Qh5": "I think Nf6 was still the best move.",
        "21... Rh8 22. Rf6": "If you'd exchanged rooks first you would have won.",
        "22... Rxh6 23. Qe2 Qxe5 24. Rxf7+ Kh8 25. Qf3 d5 26. Rf8+ Nxf8 27. Qxf8+ Kh7 28. Bd3 dxe4 29. Bc4 Rh1+ 30. Kd2 Qd4+": ""
