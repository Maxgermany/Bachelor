        "1. e4 e6": "Another French!",
        "2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4": "Humph! Still no Winawer.  While I have met this exchange before, I didn't remember much about how to play against it, so it was a case of working it out OTB.",
        "4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+": "I thought this was book and quite liked the idea of drawing Black's Q out prematurely where I could harass it and develop my minor pieces at the same time.  The closest thing my aging book on the French by Alexei Suetin (first published in German 1982, English translation 1988) has is  4... Nd7 5. Nf3 Nf6 6. Nxf6.",
        "5... Qxf6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Bg5 Qf5 8. Bd3 Qa5+ 9. Bd2 Qb6 10. Bc3 Nd7 11. O-O Nf6 12. Qe2 Bd7 13. a4 Bb4 14. a5 Qd6": "Black's 5th Q move already.",
        "15. Rfe1": "If Black doesn't castle soon, something violent is likely to erupt in the centre.",
        "15... Bxc3 16. bxc3 O-O 17. c4 Bc6 18. c3 Bxf3 19. Qxf3": "Black seems to have equalised, so my queen-chasing hasn't done me much good but now I develop a simple and strong plan and Black panics like a rabbit in the headlights.",
        "19... c6 20. Re5 Rfe8 21. Rae1 h6 22. Qh3 b6 23. Re1e3": "White ignores the irrelevant queenside gesture.  Black's king is in his sights for a brutal full-frontal assault and battery.",
        "23... bxa5 24. Rg3 Kh8": "Black sidesteps the pin that would have lost the h-pawn",
        "25. Reg5": "but now finds that same h-pawn pinned and the g-pawn threatened.",
        "25... Kg8": "? Bringing back the Q or sliding the Rook to g8 would have been better.",
        "26. Rg5xg7+ Kf8 27. Qxh6 Ke7 28. Rxf7+": "Black resigned.  If 28. ...Kxf7, 29. Qg7 mate, so he should have retreated to d8, losing the N to 29. Qxf6+ Kc8.  White would have been a piece and two pawns up but no immediate mate on offer."
