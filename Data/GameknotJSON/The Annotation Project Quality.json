        "1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4": "This is the start of Freddy's many game tournament.  This game ends in a drawn though as white I threw the win away.  Normally during this tourney white will go for blacks king quickly.  But as my opponent develops I notice the poor placement of the pieces so I continue to develop and attack when I'm ready.",
        "7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4": "This is the best response for white.",
        "9... Qd6 10. Ne6 Nd7 11. Nc3 Nf6 12. Bh3 g6 13. b3 Bh6": "I thought be bishop would be better placed on g7 after Rg8 Bg7.",
        "14. g3 Rab8 15. Bb2 Rhg8": "Neither of these rook moves I felt desirable.",
        "16. O-O-O Rbd8 17. Rhe1": "Here both black and white are fully developed though I feel white has a slight edge due to the placement of the pieces.",
        "17... b5 18. d3": "I begin by trying to attack the queen.  Though my threat may or not be dxe4.  A sightly stronger threat is Nxe4 Be5! though I'm not sure I'll have time for that one.",
        "18... Qb8": "My opponent decides to move the queen to safety.",
        "19. Nxe4": "So I grab the pawn and the center.",
        "19... Nxe4 20. Rxe4 Rd6": "Rd6 finally moves the rook away from Nxd8 though I like my knight more than that rook on d8 for the moment.  Maybe Black was hopping to double on the d file Rd8 but I stopped it with...",
        "21. Be5": "Be5 pinning the rook to the queen if Rd8 I can play Nxd8 Qxd8 Bxd6.",
        "21... Kb6": "Guess the purpose of this move was to avoid Bg2...",
        "22. d4": "Though it exposes another weakness now black must now deal with the treat of dxc5+...",
        "22... cxd4": "takes back with the pawn which is what I planned on.",
        "23. Bxd6": "Finally take the rook when it's good for me.",
        "23... exd6": "This is what I wanted but now what I expected I thought Qxd6 Rdxd4 was best for black.",
        "24. Rexd4": "Now I have a threat Rxd6+.  This is a difficult threat to deal with.  Rd8 fails to Nxd8 Qxd8 Rxd6+.  Bf8 fails to Nxf8 Rxf8 Rxc6+.",
        "24... Rc8": "I didn't see this move but I formed a plan for it after seeing this.  I fell it was fairly brilliant.",
        "25. Rd4xd6+": "Continue with my plan.",
        "25... Rc6": "Black blocks which is what I expected.",
        "26. Rd6d8": "So I go for the queen.",
        "26... Qb7 27. Rd1d7 Qa6": "I got a problem now but not hard to deal with Qxa2 is a threat but I keep blacks queen passive.",
        "28. Rb8+ Ka5": "Now the queen is trapped.",
        "29. Nc7": "Suddenly things look bleak for black.  I was looking at Rxc7 Rxc7 Qd6??? Rxa7+ Kb4 Rc8 with a3 or c3 mate to follow.",
        "29... Rxc2+": "Desperation as my opponent put it.  This move threw me for a loop.  This is where I give black drawing chances.  Best was Kxc2 (the obvious move...) Qc6+ Kd2 (black has no more checks) a6 defends Rxb5+ a4! now I believe blacks life is short.",
        "30. Kb1": "Kb1? for previous comment reasons.",
        "30... Rxc7 31. Rxc7 Qd6 32. Rxa7+ Kb4": "Now I have a problem. Rc8 doesn't cut it here. Qd1+ Rc1 Qd3+ perpetual.  The king cannot avoid checks.  Qd1+ Kb2 Qd2+ Rc2 Bg7+ Things start to get bad.",
        "33. a3+": "So I sacrifice a pawn to try to avoid perpetual.",
        "33... Kc5": "This is what I expected.  I had b4+ planned but by this point I forgot and didn't make a note to myself.  b4+ Kc6?? Rc8+ Kb6 Rd7 or b4+ Kc4 Rc8+ Kb3 Rc7 more than likely leading to a draw.",
        "34. Rc8+ Kb6 35. Rac7": "Now I can avoid perpetual. ",
        "35... Qxa3": "We agree to a draw here.  I might be able to come out with a win but I knew I had let black back into the game so I felt a draw was best."
