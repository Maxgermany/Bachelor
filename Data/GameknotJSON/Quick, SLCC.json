        "9. Bc2": "Once white played this move, I began to think about getting my bishop to g4 where at the very least I might be able to double the pawns on the kingside.  I was already thinking about maybe getting my knight to d4 adding to the attack on f3.  I thought that if things went exactly my way, I could have mating possibilities.\n",
        "9... e5 10. d5 Nd4": "White can't capture the knight because exd4, a3 dxc3, axb4 cxb2 is strong for black.\n",
        "11. O-O": "White needed to desperately prevent Bg4 by playing h3.  Now he is in big trouble.\n",
        "11... Bg4 12. Kh1 Bxc3": "This is to prevent the knight on c3 from swinging to e2 and then g3 to protect the king.\n",
        "13. bxc3 Nxf3 14. h3 Qh4": "Most class A players would have no difficulty seeing this move.\n",
        "15. gxf3 Qxh3+ 16. Kg1 Bxf3": "Now white could resign, but he plays on a little bit.\n",
        "17. Qxf3 Qxf3 18. Rab1": "Doesn't help.\n",
        "18... Qxc3 19. Bb3 f5": "I think here white should play f3 to give his king some breathing room.\n",
        "20. exf5 Rxf5 21. Rbc1": "What is the BEST MOVE for black?\n",
        "21... Qf3": "This is much faster the move Qh3 that my students usually pick.   I also thought that Rg5+ would be slower, but after Rg5+, Kh2 Qf3, Rg1 (Be4 Qh5#) Rh5#\n",
