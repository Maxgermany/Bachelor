        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 d5": "If you want to play the Sicilian,I would advise you to get a book on it, or at least play through a few grandmaster games to get a feel for your particular chosen variation. 3...cxd4 was necessary here.",
        "4. exd5 Qxd5": "Getting your queen out this early is usually a bad idea.",
        "5. Nc3": "White gains time by attacking the queen.",
        "5... Qe6+": "A horrible square for the queen. It makes the development of your bishops more difficult.",
        "6. Qe2": "6.Be2 was better.",
        "6... Qxe2+ 7. Nxe2": "Forced.",
        "7... Nb4": "Development was a higher priority.",
        "8. Kd1": "White has forfeited the right to castle, but without the queens on the board, this is not a problem.",
        "8... Bf5": "Threatening the c-pawn, but if White plays 9.c3 Black can play ...Nd3, still winning a pawn.",
        "9. Be3 Nxc2 10. Rc1 Nb4": "10...Nxe3 would have been my choice.",
        "11. Ne5": "I'm not sure what White was trying to do here. 11.a3 was the obvious move.",
        "11... cxd4": "11...e6 looks good here. If White plays 12.dxc5, Black has 12...Rd8 .",
        "12. Bxd4 Nxa2 13. Ra1 Be6": "Hanging on to the second pawn, but at some cost.",
        "14. Nf4": "White's pieces are now dominating the centre, and he threatens to double Black's pawns by capturing his best piece.",
        "14... Nb4": "14...Bb3  was much better.",
        "15. Nxe6 a6 16. Nc7+ Kd8 17. Nxa8 Nd5 18. Nxf7+ Kc8 19. Nxh8": ""
