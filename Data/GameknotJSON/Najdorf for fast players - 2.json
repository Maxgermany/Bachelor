        "7. f4": "and the almost natural response",
        "7... Nbd7": "my natural move would be Be7, but theory seems to prefer this move, so, I decided to obey as I am not very familiar to this opening.",
        "8. Qe2": "not so common. ",
        "8... Be7 9. g3": "I am not sure this is usual, but now that Q is on e2...",
        "9... Qc7": "freeing space for the queen, exposing it to the threat that will come with the sacrifice of a knight",
        "10. Qe3": "intentions unclear.",
        "10... b5": "provoking the knights. Of course, the main goal is b4.",
        "11. O-O-O": "regular move, but now it will result as a weakness.",
        "11... Bb7": "Pointing the conflict on the center and forcing white to consider a1 as a weakness.",
        "12. Ndxb5": "announced sacrifice. Will it be correct?",
        "12... axb5 13. Nxb5 Qc6": "I hesitated with Qa5, but I didn't see any advantage. I foresaw that I had at least one move of freedom, due to the double threat: Rxa2 and Qxe4: white can only cover one.",
        "14. Bxf6": "projecting the reflexion to next move.",
        "14... Nxf6": "freeing space for the queen.",
        "15. e5": "very strange... but ok, i thought",
        "15... dxe5 16. Qxe5": "and here, I realized there were a multiplication of threats on c7. And if I take a2, Qb8+ is very dangerous.",
        "16... O-O": "so this comes first.",
        "17. Bd3": "White disconsiders a2. I thought a lot about consequences on a2. I had good perspectives.",
        "17... Rxa2 18. Kb1": "interesting but imprudent move.",
        "18... Rfa8": "canoons arrive",
        "19. Na3": "mistake, probably due to the fact white did not imagine the following moves.",
        "19... Bxa3 20. bxa3 Ra2xa3": "loses a new pawn, but there is worse for white.",
        "21. Kc1": "Of course: queen can now check.",
        "21... Ra3a1+ 22. Kd2": "quitly forced",
        "22... Qg2+": "but queen preferred this place: many possibilities here. White is crumbling.",
        "23. Be2": "Rc3 would expose the king to the knight and loses the bishop.",

        "24... Ne4+": "the last soldier will participate to the pillage.",
        "25. Ke3": "25 Kc1 Ra1+ 26 Kb2 Ra8 would lose time for black. Better would be just to take the bishop, which is the (bad) reason wqhy white preferred to play on e3.",
        "25... Qf2+": "every check is necessary to avoid the possibility of a ountergame. But, frankly, it was note very plausible, unless black forgets to 1) keep the rook on line 8 2) protect the rook.",
        "26. Kd3": "only mive",
        "26... Rd8+": "the rook is all right here. ",
