        "1. c4": "English opening.  Provides the queen access to the field, and all the major responses look favorable to white.",
        "1... b6 2. e4 Bb7": "White does ok with Nc3 here.",
        "3. d3": "Pd3, however, seems to favor black in the database.",
        "3... a5": "Pa5 is not in the database.  Black seems to do ok with Pe5 instead, but not many games with this variation are recorded in the database yet.",
        "4. Nc3 Nf6 5. Bg5 Ng8": "Generally speaking returning a piece does not promote development.  Black would have been better off with Pe6 or Pe7 here, which lets the queen protect the knight.  Let white trade--white drops behind in development when the black queen advances into the field.",
        "6. Nf3 h6 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 g4 9. Be2": "Uh, no.  Nd2 or even better, Ne5.  Be2 allows PxNf3.",
        "9... Bg7": "Ok, Ne5 is out, but Nd2 remains viable.",
        "10. Nh4": "...or Nh4.  Actually, this is probably better than Nd2.  I like it.  Black can play Pd6 to attack the knight with the queen--but with the bishop protecting it the attack is pretty weak.",
        "10... e6": "Now the white h knight has nowhere to move, and the bishop is stuck protecting it, which prevents Pg3.  On the other hand--free pawn.  Bxg4 is looking great!",
        "11. Bxg4": "Yeehaw!",
        "11... f5": "White has all kinds of power on f5.  Pawn, knight, bishop.  I recommend Pxf5.",
        "12. exf5 e5": "I'm getting a thrill thinking about Ng6.  Rh7 protects the black rook, followed by NxPe5.  White's black bishop protects the knight, and white gains yet another pawn point.",
        "13. O-O": "This could have waited.  As Archduke_Piccolo noted in the comments, Bh5+ forces Ke7 or Kf8, either of which white replies with Ng6+ and then picks off Rh8.",
        "13... Nf6": "Ng6 still looks good, but as AP notes Bh5+ remains perfectly viable.  NxB, QxN+ followed by Ke7 or Kf8--either of which Ng6+ and the black rook falls.",
        "14. Nd5": "Black has two pieces protecting that square.  White ends up losing a pawn point in this exchange.  Better would be Re1.  White might also think BxPe5.  NxBg4, QxN, BxB.  We see black comes out ahead of white seizes that wayward pawn.",
        "14... Nxg4": "Wrong piece.  Although QxN, BxN, PxB leaves white's pawns doubled.",
        "15. Qxg4 c6": "QxB looks good here.  Black will have to move the rook, Rf8, and white can move in one of the knights.  Things begin looking grim for black.",
        "16. Ne3": "Oh no, QxB was SO much better.  That knight was fine where it was.  The bishop was free!",
        "16... b5": "QxB!  QxB!",
        "17. cxb5": "No one ever listens to me.",
        "17... cxb5": "That bishop isn't going to sit there forever.",
        "18. Qxg7": "Finally!  :)",
        "18... Rf8": "Ok, white likes Ng6 here.  Though BxP isn't terrible.  Or QxP+.",
        "19. Qxe5+": "I liked the knight move best.  Rf7 black threatens the queen, but it is an empty threat because Qg8+ and black cannot move Ke7 while Ng6 was played.  Black interposes the rook, QxRf8#.  Game.  Set.  Match.  11 love.\n\nHere Qe7, QxQ+, KxQ, Rfe1...  Fun, but now the game moves on past 20 moves.",
        "19... Kf7 20. Qxb5 Bc8": "Oops.  Better would have been Qc7.  Now white can play Qd5+ and take Ra8.",
        "21. Qd5+": "Just like that.",
        "21... Kg7 22. Be5+": "QxRa8 can wait.",
        "22... Kh7 23. Ng6": ""
