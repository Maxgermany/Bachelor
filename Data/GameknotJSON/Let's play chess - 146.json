        "11. Ne2 O-O 12. c3 Bb7": "Black has caught up in development due to White making a couple of tempo-wasting moves.",
        "13. Nh2 Bxh2+": "I felt like I needed to prevent Ng4 and preserve my Nf6 for defensive purposes.",
        "14. Kxh2 Re8 15. Bc2 e5 16. dxe5 Nxe5 17. Nd4": "Nd4 is a good square for this Knight.  It would be good to trade it off.",
        "17... Ne4 18. f4 Nc4 19. b3 Ncd6 20. f5": "In haste to attack, I think White missed the hanging pawn.  I calculated and estimated that I would have time to capture it.",

        "24... Nxf4 25. Qxf4 Rac8 26. Ne1": "I think this was an oversight.  White needed to deal with the threat to Bc2, but I think Rac1 was an improvement.  This move cuts off protection to the Ra1.",
        "26... Qxa1 27. Kg1 Qxa3 28. Bxe4": "I think it might have been better to keep the Bishop on the board when down material.",
        "28... Rxe4": "I'm not sure this was best.  dxe4 takes valuable squares away from the Ne1.",
