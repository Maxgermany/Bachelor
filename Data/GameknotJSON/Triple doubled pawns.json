        "1. d4 d5 2. Bf4 c5": "Very aggressive, and not often played. Good start from black. ",
        "3. c3": "Necessary, in my scheme, to counter Qb6 without playing b3. ",
        "3... Nc6 4. Nf3 Bf5": "Still aggressive. I'd like this!",
        "5. e3": "This is my normal way, here, and not a passive move. ",
        "5... e6 6. Nbd2 Nf6 7. h3": "Here starts the attack I plan as white. ",
        "7... Bd6 8. Ne5": "Key move. Black has limited exchanges available, and has to think a lot about consecuences. ",
        "8... O-O": "Accepting the challenge!",
        "9. g4": "Here it goes the first shot. ",
        "9... Bg6": "Or  Be4, Rh7!? letting the black pieces cramped, the lsb aiming to empty squares. ",
        "10. h4": "It is not all that easy, but it looks really scaring. ",
        "10... Bxe5 11. dxe5": "Cramping, crunching... but of course, black is not lost. ",
        "11... Ne4": "I don't want to exchange queens, and I don't want to play f3 (weakening the kingside). I want to attack and, if possible, castle queenside before black can create countergame. ",
        "12. h5": "...so I went for the last try before something like NxN. ",
        "12... Nxd2": "Ok, now the surprise I planned. ",
        "13. hxg6": "I'm not sure, of course, but I needed to make something from my attack, and see if it doesn't work, why. Now, NxBf1 and white will go for something like Qc2 (disregarding the N) and try a kamikaze combination on the black king. ",
        "13... Nc4": "Maybe black was afraid of that. Now, my e5 pawn is threatened, forcing me to BxN. That, under the circumstances, it is not a bad choice, since it solves a developement problem for white. ",
        "14. Rxh7": "? It doesn't work, because the pawn is in g4 and the queen can't reach the h column. Period. A blunder. ",
        "14... fxg6 15. Rh2 Nc4xe5": "Deserved fate. ",
        "16. Bxe5": "At least I will catch up in developement. ",
        "16... Nxe5 17. f4": "...with this move. ",
        "17... Qf6": "...but black surprises me with this fantastic move! The knight is immune, and I can't see nothing more than defend, sadly, with...",
        "18. Qe2": "Now the black stallion is threatened. ",
        "18... Nc4 19. O-O-O": "!? I miss power on the white squares, but I have to manage to attack, or I'll be crushed. ",
        "19... b5": "!! My opponent goes for the jugular. Any passive move from my side and I'll be wide opened. And I can't see any quick plan (my R in h2 happened to be in the wrong place, but how could I have known, so many moves ago?).",
        "20. e4": "This was desperate, overlooking...",
        "20... Qxf4+": "Ouch!!!!",
        "21. Kb1": "I expected here Nd2+, and if RxN, QxBf1+, or if QxN, QxBf1, RxQ, RxR, Kc2.",
        "21... Qxe4+": "? Snatching pawns as a tasmanian devi, but... losing attacking steam. AND overlooking a deadly simplification from my side. ",
        "22. Qxe4 dxe4 23. Bxc4 bxc4": "Now, tell me, how often do you see such an asset? My rooks open their mouthes and prepare to dinner!",
        "24. Rd6 Rae8 25. Re2 Rf4": "As a dull endgame player (my games very rarely go into endgames... :-), I managed to lose another pawn. Wow!",
        "26. Rc6 Rxg4 27. Rxc5 Rf8 28. Rxc4 Rff4 29. Ra4": "Black can win the race, but he will fight my joined brothers if he fails. ",
        "29... e5 30. Rxa7 Rg3 31. Ra5": "...and here, my opponen timeoutted... :-) a pity. Some skilled played can tell if the game is a draw or a win... Thank you for reading. "
