        "1. e4": "King pawn opening",
        "1... d5": "Scandinavian defence... Something Saco usually don't play against me, so this game is so much more interesting because of unexpected moves",
        "2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3": "Lasker variation ended with Nf3",
        "3... Bg4": "I thought with this move it would be exchange with double pawn on F file where it would be vulnerable against knights, so I moved my expected move next...",
        "4. Be2 h6": "h6 was surprise for me, but after a short thinking I decided to play as I usually play when Saco is passive and open my pieces",
        "5. b3 Qe6": "Queen e6 was again to double F file pawns, but this time without queen exchange",
        "6. O-O": "On that move I replied with quick castling and from now I felt I will be ready to attack very soon as his queen is open to my attacks",
        "6... Qf6": "Qf6 only gave me option to open my knight, but I was thinking about c3 or d4, which for some reason I didn't like and as his queen is still out I felt I can use my small pieces to attack quicker",
        "7. Nc3 c6": "once again, c6 was total surprise to me... Only logical explanation is if I play Nd5, but there I would lose rook instantly...",
        "8. Bb2 e6": "with this move queen was able to move back to square 1!",
        "9. h3 Bf5 10. Re1 Qg6": "Queen on g6 was bad move as there was answer on next move...",
        "11. Nh4 Qf6 12. Nxf5": "This was my chance to take bishop and terminate 2 bishops strength later in the game where they would become powerful. ",
        "12... Qxf5 13. Bg4": "When I played this move I was thinking on sacrifice on e6, but I was hoping Saco will play queen far away",
        "13... Qf6": "I had to work my way to remove his queen from e6 pawn...",
        "14. Na4 Qg5 15. Re5": "Re5 attacking open queen and his queen was slowly running out of safe squares... One idea was if he plays it to f6 then Rxe6+ and taking queen for rook and bishop, but...",
        "15... Qf4 16. g3 Qb4": "This was only safe square and it appeared far away from king...",
        "17. Bxe6": "After long thinking about possibilities here, I finally decided to gambit my bishop... Weighing certain loss of this game if I was unsuccessful in my combination...\n ",
        "17... fxe6": "After he took that bishop I knew I had to play my queen in and best one was with a check",
        "18. Qh5+ Kd8": "If Saco played e7 it would result in another sacrifice, but this time would be rook and I felt exciting about prospects of this game, but he moved away ",
        "19. Rxe6": "I had to take this valuable pawn from centre and perhaps hope for Qe8#, but Saco is not bad player to miss such a threat ",
        "19... Ne7": "Here he opened knight but I felt bishop there would be better and knight should go to f6",
        "20. a3": "I wanted to open d6 square",
        "20... Qb5": "Saco offered exchange, but being one piece down, I couldn't afford to take it and ease his situation",
        "21. Rd6+ Nd7 22. Nc5": "With this move I felt I am getting quality back and retaining strong attack on his king",
        "22... Kc8 23. Qe8+": "Natural move and here I feel I am having winning game...",
        "23... Kc7 24. Rxd7+": "I thought if I take this piece with queen I would lose my momentum and my rook would't be as useful, so I attacked with rook, leaving my queen to take his rook if desired next, or...",
        "24... Kb6": "Only square he can move his king ",
        "25. Rxb7+": "From here, he had 2 options... Kxc5 and my move would be taking queen with another check or Ka5 and again lossing queen with check",
        "25... Kxc5 26. Rxb5+": "Finally his queen is gone and I can take his rook after this move...",
        "26... cxb5 27. Qxa8": "From here all of his remaining pieces were blocked or pinned",
        "27... Rg8": "I guess this move was to move pinned pawn away and open bishop there attacking my queen, yet...",
        "28. Re1": "It is time to move in my final artillery piece in and try to work out mate soon, especially as all of his pieces are in awkward positions",
        "28... Nc6 29. d4+": "Looks like pawn check was final move of this magnificent attacking game...\nNot because I won, but because my opponent's mistakes made this game attractive "
