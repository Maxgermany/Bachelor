        "10. Bxe6 fxe6": "Here I wanted to remove the knight because I was not happy with it up in my face he could easily clear pieces from the centre or put pressure on me by playing d5",
        "11. Bxd4 exd4 12. Ne2 e5 13. Ng3": "Moving the attack to the kingside",
        "13... a6 14. Nh4 Nh7 15. Nhf5 Qf6": "I wanted to move more attacking piece in on the king",
        "16. Qg4 Rf7 17. Nh5 Qg5 18. Qe2": "He was holding his own",
        "18... Nf6": "Any exchange on g7 would end up with a stacked R and Q on G file",
        "19. Nxf6+ Qxf6 20. f4": "Trying to stop further Q moves to g5 and h4",
        "20... Raf8 21. fxe5": "Forcing the queen away",
        "21... Qxe5 22. Qg4 Rf7f6": "Here I missed Qg7 and wanted to kick my own butt, he just gave me the game",
        "23. Nxh6+": "Instead of taking the game I used the pin",
        "23... Rxh6 24. Rxf8+ Kxf8 25. Rf1+ Rf6": "An it gets worse, I was hoping for Kg8, so I miss calculated and it cost me",
        "26. Qc8+ Kf7": "I knew I had to wipe the deficit before the endgame",
        "27. Qxc7+ Qe7 28. Rxf6+ Kxf6 29. Qc8 Qe6 30. e5+ Kxe5 31. Qxb7 d5 32. Qxg7+": "Ok, all even.\n\nI knew I wanted to simplify, but I also knew I needed his king as far away from the passed pawns on the G and H file - I also knew he liked moving the queen in front of the King on checks",
        "32... Kd6 33. Qf8+ Qe7 34. Qb8+ Qc7": "This should do",
        "35. Qxc7+": "So this suits me...",
        "35... Kxc7 36. g4": "Starting to build the pressure, I have 6 pawns for 3 pawns and a bishop - with my pawns being better structured.... I felt I could win this if he only slipped up once, and to force that I needed to push on the G and H file",
        "36... Bd6 37. h4 Kd7 38. Kg2 Ke6 39. a4": "THis was in preparation of c3 - c3 would leave this blocking pawn hanging",
        "39... Kf6": "Bb4 would not have won for him because the bishop would be relegated to defence from here on in and would have to stay on b4 to prevent c3",
        "40. c3 dxc3 41. bxc3 Be5": "This did not work, maybe he calculated I would play d4....",
        "42. c4": "Keeping on the white squares",
        "42... dxc4 43. dxc4": "Ok, I got 4 pawns for a pawn and bishop..... but I have 3 past pawns with black only having two pieces to cover al three - to make it better they ware 3 files apart meaning I could stretch his defence even further",
        "43... Ke6": "trying to get to the centre as I also do",
        "44. Kf3 Kd6 45. Ke4": "Now I have the high ground - Kc5 kills the bishop and he cant back to h8 to stop my pawn....",
        "45... Bg3": "so he forces my pawn moves....",
        "46. h5 Be5": "So which side to push.... c5 would be a mistake as after Kxc5 I would still have to herd 2 pawns to the h&g corner and he would have time to get back",
        "47. g5": "So I put the pressure on the H&G file",
        "47... Bh8": "Here I knew this was winning  if his king leaves the centre I would push the c pawn to get his attention - he cant stop them all",
        "48. h6": "now his bishop cannot attack the pawns on G&H",
        "48... Ke6": "ok, here it comes if he goes right I go left",
        "49. c5": "Now c5 was the right threat, ",
        "49... Be5": "This does not change anything an I keep pushing",
        "50. g6": "I need the G pawn there first to make the exchange on g7",
        "50... Bf6": "So lets play a little, G7 was fine, Bxg7 hxg7, Kf8 I am up on the exchange two pawns for a bishop and I will queen on C8 because I can get my king to c7 before he can - and I will thus cover my pawn advance",
        "51. c6": "Got you - I decided to push the c Pawn, this will mean my King does not have to exhaust himself - if he goes to the c file the g7 exchange is a clean win and if he goes to G&H file the C pawn is a clear win without any help from the king",
        "51... Kd6 52. g7": "So this is where he resigned - After the exchange I will queen on G8 / 1-0.\n\nEndgames are really about calculating and playing sensible.  In the end I was glad I missed the mate earlier because it was a good endgame for me."
