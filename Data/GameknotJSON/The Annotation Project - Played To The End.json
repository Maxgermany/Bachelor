        "1. e4": "Here is yet another of the games from freddy's tourney.  I'm breaking my trend and annotating a game where I win.  ",
        "1... c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 e6": "I like e6 for Black as so far, it has afforded my quickest development.",
        "10. g3": "This move by White takes us right out of the database.  We're on our own from here on out.",
        "10... Bd6 11. Nc3 Nd7": "Just getting my pieces out.",
        "12. Ncxe4 Qe7": "I'd be happy to trade my B for a N.  I hate the White N's in this opening.",
        "13. Nxe6 Nf6": "We'll be trading off a piece...please let me have the N.",
        "14. Bf3 Nxe4": "Thanks.",
        "15. Bxe4+ Kb6 16. Bd5": "With his N pinned, my dream was to trade off my R for the N and B, thereby taking White's two developed pieces.",
        "16... Qf6 17. c3": "I think here Black was concerned about pressure on b2.  As noted, that was not what I was after.",
        "17... Rae8 18. O-O Rxe6 19. Bxe6 Qxe6": "Mission accomplished.",
        "20. d4 cxd4 21. cxd4 Bb4": "Here is where I wonder if I made an error.  I have been told that I'm a bit too aggressive and in this opening, patience is preached.  Would developing my R have been the smarter way to go?",
        "22. a3 Be1": "I thought here that I could inhibit White's Bishop, but again, my R sits idly by.",
        "23. f5 Qe2": "I'm kind of committed now as I have to guard the Bishop.  At this point, I was kicking myself for not developing my Rook.",
        "24. Bf4 Bd2": "I'm hoping to trade Bishops.  I had actually put in conditional moves as I thought White might play 25. Bd4  Rc8  26. Bc5+  Rxc5  27. exc5  Kxc5  And we'd be left with Q and B vs two Rooks.",
        "25. Bxd2 Qxd2": "At this point, my opponent wrote to me:  \"I think I've just about given away any advantage I may have had earlier. Your material superiority and active Queen should give you an easy win now. Well played.\"  I wonder if he was using psychology on me as once I heard I should have an easy win, I immediately became nervous.  I encouraged him to play on as I have lost games with better advantage and he cheerfully agreed to do so.",
        "26. Rad1 Qe3+ 27. Kg2 Qe4+": "It was around here that I wrote myself a note:\n\nKeys to the win: 1. Q does not get on same file/rank as K 2. Look to trade off Rook 3. Slowly pick off his pawns  \n\nI figured if I could do this, I should be able to win.",
        "28. Kh3 Re8 29. f6 gxf6 30. Rxf6+ Re6 31. Rxe6+ Qxe6+": "Well--so far, so good.  ",
        "32. g4 h5 33. Rg1 Qe3+ 34. Rg3 hxg4+ 35. Kxg4 Qxd4+ 36. Kh3 Qxb2": "The pawns start to drop.",
        "37. Rg6+ Kc7 38. Rh6 Qxa3+ 39. Kg4 b5 40. Rh7+ Kc6 41. Rh6+ Kc5 42. Rh5+ Kc4 43. Rh3": "I did the math and exchanging Q for R was winning for Black.",
        "43... Qxh3+ 44. Kxh3 b4 45. Kg3 b3": "And now we just play the game out to checkmate.  An enjoyable game and I look forward to my next one against rjacobs.",
