        "3. Nc3 Bb7 4. f4": "Almost a delayed King's Gambit. Clearly it catches Elzie off guard, because he plays an incredibly poor move in response.",
        "4... f6": "Chess is 2/3 psychology. If you can spring a variant on your opponent that he's unprepared for, you can often induce a mistake... like this blunder, for instance.",
        "5. fxe5": "Colvin exchanges the Pawns before striking.",
        "5... fxe5": "Lulled into a false sense of security, Elzie completes the exchange.",
        "6. Qh5+": "Ouch. Now it's a matter of how Elzie wants to lose.",
        "6... Ke7": "The answer is quickly. 6...P-N3 7 QxKP ch folloed by 8 QxR would be how to lose slowly.",
        "7. Qf7+ Kd6 8. Nb5+": "The King-hunt is on in earnest.",
