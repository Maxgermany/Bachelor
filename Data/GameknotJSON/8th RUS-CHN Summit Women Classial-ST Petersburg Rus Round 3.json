        "9. Bd2": "this move was suggested to me by Mikhail Kobalia in 2008. I recalled it and decided to choose this line. The idea is to take a5 under control. This square is often useful for the knight ",
        "9... b4 10. a5": "A typical reply to b4 - it prevents Na5. If the Black pawn is on b5, a5 makes no sense, because White can't take advantage of the a4 square (the bishop is often put there) ",
        "10... O-O 11. Be3": "I forgot my analysis here. The right move order is 11.h3 ",
        "11... Kh8": "This move shows that Black is planning to play f5 \n(Black could have played 11...Ng4 and White would have had to retreat the bishop )",
        "12. h3 Be8": "I am not sure why Black made this move. Maybe she wanted to transfer the knight to c5. But why h6-Nh7 on next moves?",
        "13. Nbd2 h6 14. Nc4": "Here White to decide whether to try to prevent Black's plan. It could have been done by Ba4 \n(14. Ba4!?and if Black insists 14... Nh7 then comes an important move 15.c3 bxc3 16. bxc3 White's pieces are harmoniously placed. The next move will be d4, capturing the centre. If 16...f5 17.exf5 Rxf5 18.d4 exd4 19.Bxc6 dxe3 20.Bxa8)",
        "14... Nh7 15. d4": "This is a logical plan for the pawn structure. e5 will be under pressure, so Black has to make a choice what to do in the centre \n(An attempt to put pressure on b4 is no good 15.Bd2 f5 16.exf5 Rxf5 17.Ne3 Rf8 18.Nd5 Nf6 19.Nxb4 Nxb4 20.Bxb4 Bh5)",
        "15... f5": "(If 15...exd4 then possible is 16.Nxd4 Ng5 17.Nf5 Bf6\n(17...Nxe4? 18.Qg4 Ng5 19.f4 Ne6 20.Nxe7 Qxe7 21.f5 Ng5 22.f6 gxf6 23.Rae1)\n18.Qh5 Nh7 19.Qe2 Ne7\n(19...Ng5 20.Rad1)\n20.Nd4 Ng5 21.Bxg5 Bxg5 22.Rad1 Ng6 23.Ne3 White is better due to having more space and better-placed pieces )",
        "16. exf5": "The most logical moves. Alternatives are 16.de and 16.d5 \n(16.dxe5 fxe4 17.Nd4 Nxd4 18.Qxd4 d5 19.Nd2 Bf7\n(19...c6 20.f3)\n20.e6 Bxe6 21.Nxe4 c6 22.Nc5\n(22.Qe5 Bxh3 23.Bxh6 Nf6 24.Nxf6\n(24.Bg5 Bg4)\n24...Bxf6 25.Qh5\n(25.Qh2 gxh6 26.Qxh3 Bg7 27.c3 bxc3 28.bxc3 Qf6)\n25...Be6 26.

        "16... e4 17. Nh2 d5": "(Bad is 17...Rxf5 due to 18.d5)",
        "18. Ne5 Rxf5 19. Qg4": "?! Loss of a tempo. What is the queen doing here? \n(Preferable was 19. f4 enforcing the knight on e5 19...Rf8 20.Nhg4 Nf6 21.Qd2)\n(also good is 19.Nhg4)",
        "19... Rf6": "(Stronger is 19...Qc8 20.f4 Bd6 not committing the rook)\n(Also possible is 19...Rf8 then White has to admit the mistake and retreat with the queen 20.Qd1)",
        "20. f4": "this move makes sense, but there was another good option \n(Not recommended is 20.f3? Nxe5 21.dxe5 h5 22.Qg3 Rf5 threatening Bh4)\n(White has to retreat with the queen 20.Qd1 and now f3 is possible 20...Rf5 21.Nhg4)",
        "20... Rb8": "not the best decision \n(Better was 20...Rf8 and White replies with 21.Qd1)",
        "21. Qd1": "A strong player should be able to admit his mistakes. Chess is like life in this respect. \n(Even better is 21.Qe2 targeting a6 )",
        "21... Rf8 22. Nhg4": "Finally, the second knight is starting to take part in the action ",
        "22... Qd6": "(The position would have simplified after 22...Nf6 23.Nxc6 Bxc6 24.Ne5 Be8 25.Ba4 Bxa4 26.Ng6+ Kg8 27.Nxf8 Bb5 28.Ne6 Qc8 29.f5 Bxf1 30.Qxf1 but White is better thanks to the powerful knight on e6)",
        "23. Kh1": "?! wasting a tempo again \n(Stronger is 23.Nxc6 Qxc6\n(23...Bxc6 24.Ne5 Be8 25.Qe1 with the idea of rerouting the queen to the h2-b8 diagonal, thus supporting f5)\n24.Ba4 Qb7 25.Ne5)",

        "24... Bxf6 25. g4": "This move is risky. I was pressing for a win too hard. White has wasted a few precious tempi, while Black has mobilized her forces ",
        "25... Bh4 26. Kg2": "(26.Qd2 White should just take a stand. There is no advantage, so the best strategy is just to wait)",
        "26... Rd8": "(A good move was 26...Ne7 freeing the way for the bishop)",
        "27. Qd2": "?! (White should have simplified the position by 27.Qe2 Ne7 28.c4 bxc3 29.bxc3 Rb8 30.Rab1 Bb5 31.c4 dxc4 32.Bxc4 Bxc4 33.Nxc4 White must be careful, but the knight on e5 is good enough to help draw the game)",

Black has an edge here, but this was still the best choice for White)",
        "28... Bxc6 29. Ba4 Bxa4 30. Rxa4 Rdb8": "Now Black is better: White's king is vulnerable; the bishop on e3 is passive ",
        "31. Qe2 Qe6": "(31...Rf6)",
        "32. Raa1 Bf6 33. f5 Qc6 34. h4": "? A nervous decision in time trouble. White's position is not yet that desperate - no need to start sacrificing pawns. Also, I have overestimated the compensation for the pawns \n(More solid and sound was 34.b3)",
        "34... Bxh4 35.
