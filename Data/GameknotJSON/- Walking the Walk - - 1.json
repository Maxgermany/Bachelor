        "1. e4": "Mistee is challenged to a game by Easy19 (wonder what his name means?) Mistee plays white and moves her normal e4.",
        "1... h6": "Mr. 19 surprises Mistee with h6. That's never happened to her before. She wonders what's up with that?",
        "2. d4": "Mistee continues with d4....trying to control the center as her old coach Brian and the great and handsome lebanese/canuk tuff taught her.",
        "2... a6": "Another surprising move by Mr. 19. But Mistee loves the pattern of the pawns.",
        "3. Nf3": "Mistee continues developing her pieces. Controlling space. Playing the center. Mistee remembers her coaching.",
        "3... e6": "Now Mr. 19 is playing more normal for Mistee. Still a nice pawn pattern on the board.",
        "4. Bd3": "Mistee moves out the King's bishop to prepare for castling. She is still remembering her coaching. So far so good.",
        "4... c5": "Easy19 moves c5, more of what Mistee considers a \"normal\" move since it controls more of the center. Mistee has a feeling that Easy19 is going to beat her to death with his pawns.",
        "5. c3": "Mistee moves c3 to add additional protection to the d4 pawn and to strengthen her pawn structure. Lined up pawns are pretty pawns.",
        "5... cxd4": "Mr. 19 is destroying my lovely slanted pawn pattern.",
        "6. cxd4": "Should I take Easy19's pawn with the knight or my pawn? I like my knight where it is so I take with my pawn. Now I see that he could possibly put me in check with his bishop destroying all hopes for castling. Where are my chess coaches when I need them?",
        "6... d5": "Easy moves his pawn forward creating a nice pawn line.",
