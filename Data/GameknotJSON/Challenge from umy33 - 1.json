        "1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 cxb2 5. Bxb2": "The Danish gambit accepted! An opening which I use on a regular basis. Although it gives two extra pawns to black, it is quite difficult for black to defend against whites extremely mobile pieces.",
        "5... Nc6": "This is not a standard line as far as I know. My opponent takes the game out of the opening books. I had to use my aggressive instincts to stay put.",
        "6. Nf3 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 Nge7": "Perhaps Nf6 followed by the plan of Ne4 is better!",
        "8. O-O O-O 9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. Qxd5": "My attack starts building up!",
        "10... Be7 11. Rad1": "...With the idea of pinning the d pawn after my queen moves out of the d-file.",
        "11... d6 12. Qh5": "Keeping the queen in close proximity to the black king.",
        "12... Bd7 13. Rfe1": "Seeing that I'd have to make up my position before beginning the assault!",
        "13... Qc8": "This,in my view, is the first great error of my opoonent. It allows me to attack instantly.",
        "14. Ng5 Bxg5": "Almost forced!",
        "15. Qxg5 Ne5": "A good attempt for defense.",
        "16. f4": "maybe h6 might have saved the game.",
        "16... Ng6 17. f5 Ne5 18. Bxe5": "Now I destroy the knight which is the last defense of the king against the f-pawns advance!",
        "18... dxe5 19. f6": "The decisive advance!",
        "19... g6": "There is no other defense! ",
        "20. Qh6": "Here my opoonent resigned because there is no defense for Qg7#. A good game. This is why I love the Danish gambit!"
