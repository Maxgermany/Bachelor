        "1. e4": "I spend the first half of the game slowly picking apart his defenses on the right hand (with even trades) not gaining any leeway points-wise, but making  slow progress toward opening  up the castle, and snatching the throne. But in the  end a dang horse shifts the balance of the game, with a rather magnificent fork on the part of my opponent, which is immediately compounded by a stupid greedy move on my part, resulting in a queen for queen trade. When the dominoes fall nothing is left for me. (Thanks ionadowman for helping me analyze my many mistakes.)",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nc3 d6 3. d4 g6 4. d5": "Someone recently suggested to me this pawn push to be a weak  maneuver...seems to work out here, but maybe I should have been developing knights or bishops.\n.....................................................................................\nblake78613 (1830):\nthe thematic push White is looking for against the Pirc is e4-e5. this becomes much harder after White plays d4-d5. \n.....................................................................................\n\nThanks, I'll give that a try, if I can even recognize the Pirc next I see it. (Had to look it up to understand what you were talking about.) lol...could probably stand to study a lil more chess in general.",
        "4... e5 5. Bg5 h6 6. Bh4 g5 7. Bg3": "My bishop is chased off by pawns, but the castle on the  king's side is no longer a sweet possibility for black.",
        "7... Nbd7 8. f3": "Escape hatch.",
        "8... Nh5 9. Bf2": "knight encourages me through it.",
        "9... Nf4 10. g3": "You are standing too close to my stuff.",
        "10... Ng6 11. Qe2 Nb6 12. O-O-O Bd7 13. Bh3 Be7 14. Nb5 O-O 15. Bxd7 Qxd7 16. h4": "He castles into an open spot, I initiate trade so as to further open it  up.",
        "16... a6 17. Nc3 Nc8 18. hxg5 Bxg5+ 19. Be3 f6 20. Nh3 Bxe3+ 21. Qxe3 Kg7 22. Nf2": "King steps for ward to hold the walls up himself, and my horsie sidesteps, to open up a line of attack.",
        "22... Rh8 23. Ng4 h5 24. Nf2 Nce7 25. g4 h4 26. g5 f5 27. exf5 Nxf5 28. Qe4": "Castle is opened up, non-existent. Still having trouble getting through. Here I set him up for the  fork that changes the game. Well...loses the game.",
        "28... Ng3": "There it is.",
        "29. Qa4": "I take a shot at a queen snatch. Instead I wind up trading  ladies. Basically a desperation gamble.",
        "29... Qxa4 30. Nxa4 Nxh1 31. Rxh1 Raf8 32. Rh3 Nf4 33. Rh2 Nxd5 34. Nh3 Rxf3 35. Nf2 Rhf8 36. Nd3 h3 37. Kd2": "Black's advantage grows in pawns. All thanks to that fork. The king no longer needs the castle he lost. I have thrown this game away with one foolish move.",
        "37... c5 38. Ke2 Rg3 39. Nf2 Rg2 40. Kf1": "King gives up his kingdom for a horse. For some reason  I saw only Rgxf2, and not this move. I didn't even  think of Rh2 which would have been equally disastrous, but not as cool to look at.",
        "40... Rfxf2+ 41. Ke1 Rgxh2 42. c4 Ne3 43. Nxc5": "And I am officially completely dead. I think I'd have had  this one if not for that one fork, and the domino effect occurring after. Mental note: challenge that dang nun-orc to a rematch some time.",
        "43... Rf1#": "PS: I challenged nunorc to several rematchs, but she will not accept. She knows that she got lucky in this game, and that I would beat her in the next."
