This is a thematic move in the Sicilian Dragon. The rook eyes the knight on c3 with x-ray vision, prepared to possibly sacrifice itself there eventually.",
        "11. Bb3 Ne5": "Obviously, it's not time to do so yet. Just because a sacrifice is thematic and possible does not mean that it should be played automatically. Both sides have signalled their intentions here - to go straight for each other's kings!",
        "12. h4 h5": "Black cannot allow White's pawn to go to h5.",
        "13. Bg5 Rc5 14. g4 hxg4 15. f4 Nc4 16. Qd3 b5": "This move, which is still not a new move, works for tactical reasons, as we shall see...",
        "17. Ndxb5": "Has White won a pawn for nothing?",
        "17... Nxb2": "Black's dragon bishop breathes fire down the long diagonal.",
        "18. Kxb2 Bxb5": "The first new move according to the Gameknot database. 18...Nxe4 had been played twice previously.",
        "19. Nxb5 Nxe4+ 20. Kb1": "I analyzed this game with Shredder, which concluded that 20.Kc1 would have been much better for White. The king is very vulnerable on b1 to mates on b2.",
        "20... Nf2": "Material isn't the most important consideration here, but it makes sense to remove one of the rooks, as the knight was threatened anyway.",
        "21. Qe2 Nxd1": "I think I probably should have captured the rook on h1 instead.",
        "22. Rxd1 Qa5 23. a4 Rb8": "23...Rxb5 followed by Qc3 would have been much better.",
