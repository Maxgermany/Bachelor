        "1. e4": "The Giuoco Piano is my current major subject of chess study.  I have been playing on FICS recently and in games so far I have noticed that most players diverge (if White) after 4. ... Nf6 or (if Black) after 5. d4.  The resulting games vary wildly.\n\nHere, I play Black.  My opponent, after the initial moves, elects to exchange off as quickly as possible.  My goal in the game is to use this to my own advantage by dictating the timings and concentrating towards the center.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. Qb3": "White plays to pick up a pawn quickly.",
        "5... O-O": "The normal 5. ... d5 is out.  On 6. exd5, 6. ... Nb5 7. Qa4 Nxc4 8. Qxc4 Bd6 has Black into full retreat with the loss of a pawn - and that's the best option.  The text covers White's planned intrusion and develops the Rook.",
        "6. Ng5": "White persists in the attack.  6. O-O and development, or 6. d4 in the center would be preferable.  The result is going to be poor largely because of the Queen's over-ambition.",
        "6... Qe7 7. Nxf7 Rxf7 8. Bxf7+ Qxf7 9. Qxf7+ Kxf7": "The exchange is a disaster for White, even though the count comes even.  Black is developed and controls the center: White is entirely not, and all his pieces are block in.\n\nMy game plan from here is to control the center, gain a pawn majority as the position permits, and roll to victory.",
        "10. d3 Ne7": "An uncalled for retreat.  The direct 10. ... d6 was in order.  d5 is playable as well although the result is an isolated King's pawn.",
        "11. Be3 b6": "Retreat is not plausible, and the fiancetto'd Bishop will attack e4.",
        "12. d4": "If 12. Bxc5 bxc5 the Knights and pawns control the middle still, and White loses his only developed piece - again.  The text aims to force a retreat but it's too early for White to resume his offensive as he gives away a pawn.  12. Nd2 was in order.  (Black follows with Bc7 or possibly Ng4.  If 12. ... Bxe3 13. fxe3 gives White a substantial center which will frustrate Black's control and threaten the Knight and King with O-O later.)",
        "12... exd4 13. cxd4 Bb4+ 14. Bd2 Bxd2+ 15. Nxd2 Bb7 16. f3": "For now White has a substantial-looking center, and Black pays the price for over-caution earlier.",
        "16... d5": "And the direct assault does not help.  Better was d6 or possibly even Nc6.",
        "17. e5 Nd7 18. O-O Ng6 19. g3": "White makes the most of his King-side majority.",
        "19... Rf8 20. Kg2 Ke6 21. Rac1 c6 22. a4 Nb8 23. b4 a6": "This plays into White's attack and Rook advantage.  23. ... Nd7 was better.  Then if 24. b5 c5 and Black's position is better than the text.",
        "24. a5": "24. b5 a5 was better, since it ties down Black's two pieces.",
        "24... b5 25. Nb3 Nd7 26. g4 h6 27. f4 Nxf4+": "Until this point White's attack had done well enough but the pressure is off now and Black's Knight is home free.  27. Kg3 was better and might have won the game for White.\n\nBlack is now looking to trade down.  With the pawn line strongly held the advantage of an extra piece should force at least a draw - even with a poorly placed bishop and no rook.",
        "28. Kg3": "Gives away any remaining advantage to the ensuing Knight fork.  The correct move is Kh1.",
        "28... Ne2+": "White resigns."
