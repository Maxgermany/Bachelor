        "1... e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4": "I'm not convinced about d6 as a reply, I just carry on as normal since it helps my development and curtails the f8 bishop for me.",

        "9... O-O 10. e5": "Deliberate move, fairly ambitious but nowt tried, nowt gained.",
        "10... d5 11. Qxh7#": "*grins* And thats why I don't like the book suggestion about castling as early as possible. If I can I like to keep it as an option until midgame."
