    "moves": {
        "1. e4 Nf6": "I respond to White's opening move with the Alekhine Defence.\n",
        "2. Nc3": "Another option for White is 2.e5, but of course this move is perfectly sound as well.\n",
        "2... d6": "A good move to pre-empt a future e5 for White, as my own knight can no longer access the d5 square if he was forced to move. Nc6 is also playable.,\n",
        "3. d4": "Given the chance, White occupies the centre with both her pawns, and later on Black will have to find a way to undermine this centre.\n",
        "3... Nc6 4. Nf3": "Both sides bring out their knights, and from my point of view d5 won't be too comfortable for Black [Nb4 would make the knight a big target, Ne5 weakens my pawn structure after White exchanges and Nb8 is undevelopment]\n",
        "4... Bg4": "Black blunts the effects of d5 for now, since the knight can now go to e5...\n",
        "5. Be2": "...but White breaks that pin easily\n",
        "5... e6": "Black goes for another tactic - now if White were to move his pawn to d5...\n",
        "6. d5": "...I can retreat the my knight to e7. 6...Ne5 7.Nxe5 Bxe2 8.Qxe2 dxe5 can be played without loss of material, but I preferred the look of Nd7.\n",
        "6... Ne7 7. Bg5": "Since the queen no longer covers f6, White threatens to double up pawns kingside. To be honest, that probably wasn't too much of a big deal for Black, but all the same I didn't want the doubled pawns at the time...\n",
        "7... Ng6": "?? Black thinks that the knight is better on this square than e7, but fails to realise how important the knight had been on e7. A much better plan would be a6, then Qd7, then 0-0-0 assuming White doubles up my pawns.\n",
        "8. Bb5+": "! Since the knight doesn't control c6, the pawn can't block this bishop. Therefore, the king must move!\n",
        "8... Ke7 9. Qd4": "Queen centralisation, and now White can once again double up my pawns with Bxf6+ if she wanted to. [or is it he? There's a picture of an anime girl on xukapy's profile but the name 'Hikaru' can be a name for either sex... sorry, I'm rambling but I'll assume 'she' :)]\n",
        "9... Bxf3": "Since my king can no longer castle, Black looks to get all the material - especially the queens - off the board so that my uncastled king isn't so much of a big deal. As an added bonus, White's pawns get doubled up.\n",
        "10. gxf3": "White would have known that as well, I'm sure, but another reason why she might not have played Bxf6+ is that the bishop's power outweighs the power of my pinned knight.\n",
        "10... Ne5": "!? Black blocks the queen's scope to f6, centralises his knight and threatens a game-winning queen fork with Nxf3+ - not a bad multi-purpose move. Unfortunately it's not an outpost due to the pawns on the f file.\n",
        "11. Be2": "I was expecting White to move his queen to protect f3, but I hadn't seen this move, which was better.\n",
        "11... c5": "With White having a considerably strong presence on the kingside and especially in the centre, Black looks to get an advantage queenside, and this pawn thrust looked Win-Win to me. Should White capture en passant, her centre gets broken down and if not, Black earns queenside space with tempo.\n",
        "12. Qe3": "Black earns queenside space with tempo... and now what can Black do?\n",
        "12... Ke8": "Respond to White's threat, that's what! White threatens the powerful 13.f4! followed by 14.e5, which would win material. If White were to play 13.f4 now then the game might continue; 13...Ned7 14.e5 h6! 15.Bh4 Nxd5 and Black actually ends up one pawn to the better (which is why the absolute pin on the king had to be broken) so White would have to accept the exchange [and the decrease in the pressure he exerts] with 15.exf6 hxg5\n",
        "13. O-O-O": "White doesn't go for that line, however, and calmly builds up his forces. It should be obvious that White has complete control of this game - while he has finished development, Black has only developed his two knights, and cannot castle.\n",
        "13... h6": "I was thinking of Bd7 to fully break the pin on the knight, but then I decided to break the pin a different way - now the bishop will have to retreat... or not!\n",
        "14. f4": "!! Brilliant move from White! I don't know whether it deserves two exclamation marks (at least one) but I associate this move as when White took complete control of this game! I considered the exchange 14...hxg5 15.fxe5 but that leads to disaster - a) 15...dxe5 16.dxe6! followed by 17.Bb5+ is crushing. b) 15...Nd7 16.[again] dxe6! and whether the knight [Bb5+] or pawn [Bh6+] moves, White will crush Black!\n",
        "14... Ned7": "With the exchange out of the question, Black retreats...\n",
        "15. Bh4": "...as does White, and another advantage of f4 is revealed - Black cannot play g5.\n",
        "15... Be7": "I was so desperate to break the pin on the knight that I jumped at the opportunity to do so now... though I think 15...e5 might have been better here. \n",
        "16. dxe6 fxe6": "White exchanges pawns, and now proceeds to clamp her vice on my position even tighter!\n",
        "17. Rhg1": "An attack on g7...\n",
        "17... Rg8": "Black defends the pawn [but should he have done that? I'll come back to that a bit later]\n",
        "18. Bc4": "Now White attacks the e6 pawn!\n",
        "18... Nf8": "The only way to defend the pawn, since Kf7 leads to e5 - my position is definitely in ruins now! With that note, perhaps White should have played another move at move 17, sacrificing the g7 pawn. The White rook is on the seventh rank, but can't do much else. Would that have worked, I wonder?\n",
        "19. Kb1": "White plays a waiting move, so what can Black do with his move?\n",
        "19... a6": "Preparing b5 - this was the only course of action I could really see in this position...\n",
        "20. e5": "! White strikes at both my pinned pawn and my knight - since the pawn can't be captured the knight must move.\n",
        "20... Ng4": "? Still desperate for counterplay, Black plays aggressively but falls prey to a pretty combination from White.\n",
        "21. Rxg4": "First, the exchange...\n",
        "21... Bxh4 22. Rxd6": "...and then win of a pawn.\n",
        "22... Qe7": "Forced, if Black wants to keep his bishop. White can now, should she choose to do so, take the e5 pawn to increase the pawn advantage to +2. However...\n",
        "23. f5": "! Another brilliant move, taking advantage of the power of the light-square bishop on c4 - with no other piece to defend e6, the e6 will fall if Black doesn't exchange.\n",
        "23... exf5": "If Black does exchange, however...\n",
        "24. Rxh4": "! White wins a piece!\n",
        "24... Qxh4": "Might as well follow this through...\n",
        "25. Bxg8 Qxh2": "Black is lost, but he still has a slim chance of stealing the game due to White's one back rank weakness. Since two pieces control d1, however, White need not worry about that right now, but still playing a move like b3 would deprive Black of all hope!\n",
        "26. Qxc5": "du-du-du-du-du! Another Pawn Bites The Dust!\n",
        "26... Ng6": "With the hope that White comes onto this game tired and drunk and decides to grab at the free material! :) Of course, if White did that then Qh1+ would mate, but why would White take a lowly knight when she can capture the king!\n",
        "27. Re6+": "Mate in 3\n",
        "27... Kd8": "27...Ke7 28.Nd5#\n",
        "28. Qd6+ Kc8 29. Re8#": "like I said, Black was on the ropes the moment he lost the right to castle, and all White had to do is slowly gain the positional advantage before White had an attack that Black could not defend against! 1-0\n"
