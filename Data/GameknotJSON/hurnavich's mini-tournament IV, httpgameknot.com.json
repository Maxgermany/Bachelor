        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 e6 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 d6 6. e4 g6 7. Nf3 Bg7 8. Bf4": "Everything has moved along main line paths until now. Also popular is 8.Bg5\n",
        "8... O-O 9. Nd2": "A very common move in the Bf4 and Bg5 lines. The white knight is headed to c4 where it can aid in the attack of the d6 point. The d6 point is traditionally the weakest point in black's defense. \n",
        "9... a6": "Two relatively unexplored alternatives for black are 9...Ng4 and 9...Ne8. Both are IMO better than the game move. After 9...a6 black has not had much success in top play. Mostly because black does better when he resolves the pressure on d6 quickly.  \n",
        "10. a4 Nh5": "This thematic knight move has been championed by John Watson in his book 'Starting out: Modern Benoni' Strategically black wants to follow up with ...Nd7 and ...Ne5 in preparation of ...f7-f5. \n",
        "11. Be3 Bd4": "!? There is nothing inherently bad about this move but offering to give up your prized Bishop for a weaker one is never a good idea. In almost all cases it is black who will miss the DSB as he will have to maintain control of the dark squares with his queen which is easily harassed by the weaker pieces. \n",
        "12. Nc4": "Anticipating the exchange. So I play to put my knight on a very good square. \n",
        "12... Bxe3 13. Nxe3": "Overall, I would say that white is doing better. On black side he has managed to resolve the problematic d6 weakness for the foreseeable future. The absence of the DSB means that b7-b5 is highly unlikely. So black must throw everything into making f7-f5 work. \n",
        "13... Nd7 14. g3": "a powerful little move, keeping the knight out of f4 and supporting said f2-f4 advance. \n",
        "14... Ng7": "?! If there is an improvement to be made in this whole line for black it is right here. The logic in this move is to support ...f7-f5 or maybe to play ...Ne8 to meet Nc4. Either way black may have better luck with ...Rb8; ...Re8 or ...Nhf6. \n",
        "15. Nc4": "hitting at d6 again. \n",
        "15... Nb6 16. Nd2": "The knight has moved 4 times already is well traveled. I am anticipating an attack on e4 shortly so nd2 and Bg2 should do the trick. \n",
        "16... Nd7 17. Bg2": "e4 point is now well defended\n",
        "17... f5": "and here it is\n",
        "18. O-O fxe4": "only move\n",
        "19. Ncxe4": "Black will try to secure the F-file for operations but this idea seems to not work. \n",
        "19... Nf6 20. Nxf6+ Qxf6": "This is where black's missing DSB begins to be felt. Black has no chance of succeeding without it. In the meantime, black threatens to win a pawn on b2. However, again the weak d6-pawn becomes liability. \n",
        "21. Ne4 Qd8 22. Qd2 Bf5": "Activating the LSB and trying to repel the pressure on d6. \n",
        "23. Rfe1 Bxe4 24. Rxe4": "We are pretty much level here though I have to say that white looks much more active. \n",
        "24... b5": "?! a very risky move that will cost black dearly. When defending improve your pieces and move pawn only when you have too. Better possibly are ...Qf6 or ...Nf5. \n",
        "25. Bh3": "! Black has forgotten that e6 is in dire need of defending. \n",
        "25... b4": "The computer thinks black is still in this for a draw. It sees that ...Qf6 can marshals the defenses on the king side just in time. But what it does not see is how quickly white can gain space and time attacking the queen. The key is that as of yet there is no direct attack against the black king so the computer thinks everything is fine. \n",
        "26. Rae1": "Now 26...Qf6 is forced to try and hold e6 but that is not going to be enough. \n",
        "26... Qf6 27. Rf4": "The first nail is in the coffin. Gaining control of the critical f7-square. The gameknot computer stubbornly thinks black is inferior but still ok. \n",
        "27... Qd8 28. Be6+ Kh8": "The bishop can not be taken i.e 28...Nxe6 29. dxe6 Qe7 30. Qd5 should enough to win for white. \n",
        "29. Ree4 Nh5 30. Rxf8+": "This guarantees that I have an enduring dominance on the light squares. \n",
        "30... Qxf8 31. a5": "! A in between move that forces black into a corner. Black has no good moves so forcing him to make one is the idea here. \n",
        "31... Nf6 32. Rf4": "Pinning the knight with the idea of 33.b3 and 34.Qb2 with a nasty pin on f6. \n",
        "32... Qg7": "forced or 33. b3 is to follow\n",
        "33. h4": "I love moves like this, they are like little can openers that just do so much damage. Black falls quickly now as he has too many weak points. \n",
        "33... Rf8": "trying to shore up f6 but abandoning the a6-pawn. Perhaps ...Qe7 is a little better \n",
        "34. Qd3 Ra8 35. Qf3": "black can not plug up the holes fast enough\n",
        "35... Rf8 36. g4": "exploiting the pinned knight by threatening to play g5\n",
        "36... h6 37. Kg2": "Alternative variation: 37. g5 [?!] 37... hxg5 38. hxg5 Nh7 39. Rxf8+ Nxf8 40. Qf4 Nxe6 41. dxe6 Qe7 42. Qe3 [\u221e]\nAlternative variation: 37. b3 [!?] 37... g5 38. hxg5 hxg5 39. Rf5 [is the same as the game]\n",
        "37... g5 38. hxg5 hxg5 39. Rf5 Nh7 40. Rxf8+ Nxf8 41. Qh3+ Qh7 42. Bc8": "With the fall of the a6-pawn black resigns after two more moves. \n",
        "42... Qxh3+ 43. Kxh3": "I hope you enjoyed this game. \n"
