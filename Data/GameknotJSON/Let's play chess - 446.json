        "1. f4": "This was a Bird's opening, similar to other one in which I played black, I diverge from my opponent in the other game by avoiding to exchange my light squares bishop, and avoiding also damage to my pawn structure, then followed a good plan to fianchetto the dark squares bishop, and exploit black's constricted position. Black's queen was soon trapped and black had to give up a piece to avoid losing his queen, due to heavily scattered pawn structure, a couple of advanced black pawns, and more active rooks consolidation was hard to achieve, but some poor move choices by black allowed the position to became slowly easier for white, until black finally lost all possible counterplay",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. e3 Bg4": "Bird's opening, Lasker variation, this was the second game with a Bird's opening I play at the same time, now with white pieces, probably my opponents tried to confuse me, although it was my opponent in the other game that chose to play the Bird's against me...",
        "4. Bb5": "This pin is the most sharp and probably the better reply to Bg4",
        "4... Qd6": "Black shows he cares about the possible damage to his pawn structure after the exchange Bxc6, up until now we were following Larsen, Bent - van Geet, Dirk, Amsterdam, 1964 (1-0), the game continues with 5 0\u20130 a6 6 Be2 (6 Bxc6+?! Qxc6 7 h3 Bxf3 8 Rxf3 e6 gives White nothing from the opening) 6...Nf6 7 d4 Ne4 8 c4 e6 9 Nc3 Rd8 10 c5 Qd7 11 Nxe4 dxe4 12 Ne5 Bxe2 13 Qxe2 Qd5 14 Bd2 f6 15 Nxc6 Qxc6 16 b4! Larsen spots the best chance to make progress by advancing the pawns on the queenside giving him the edge.\n ",
        "5. O-O": "to protect the king and add another defender to the f3 knight",
        "5... Nf6 6. Be2": "with queen on d6 (or d7) I don't want to give up my bishop pair for nothing, so a retreat is the best option white has here",
        "6... h5 7. b3": "this is a thematic idea for this bird's variation to fianchetto my queen side bishop to get a stronger hold of key square e5, unlike the other game I can follow this plan as black could not capture on f3 forcing gxf3 disrupting my pawn structure, also my c2 pawn is protected and black's queen is not a threat on d6",
        "7... Nd7 8. Bb2 f6 9. h3": "forcing black to decide, Bxf3 would be bad now, as black light squares were somehow weakened by the previous move f6",
        "9... Bxf3 10. Bxf3": "I now have a small advantage, I keep the bishop pair, and my pawn structure is healthier than black's pawn structure",
        "10... O-O-O": "black left the h pawn \"en prise\", the capture of this pawn can give me a precious advantage",
        "11. Nc3": "black is a bit cramped and my last piece is developed with an attack to d5",
        "11... e6 12. Nb5": "sow I'll try to set a trap to black's queen, profiting from black's cramped position",
        "12... Qe7 13. Bxh5": "... finally I capture the pawn and in the process complete the trap on black's queen",
        "13... Rh6": "? pointless, when the queen is in trouble, black should have been more assertive in providing an escape or launching  a counter-attack",
        "14. Ba3": "extending the fianchetto wins a piece for white",
        "14... Nc5": "blocks the attack, but loses the knight to d4",
        "15. d4 Qd7 16. dxc5 g6 17. Bf3": "now with a material advantage (piece and a pawn), the strategy has changed, and I'll focus my attack on the castled king ",
        "17... Bg7 18. Rc1": "avoiding the Bg7, and placing the rook behind the c pawns, the idea is to play c4 to open some lines",
        "18... e5 19. c4 e4 20. cxd5": "Now I decided to try and lead black in to a series of exchanges according the the following variation:\n20...exf3 21. dxc6 bxc6  - here black can also play 21...Qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...\n\n22. Qxd7+ - to attract the rook to d7 \n\n22...Rxd7 23. Nxa7+ - to coerce the king to b7 \n\n23...Kb7 24. Nb5 - sacrificing the knight to vacate c6 \n\n24...cxb5 25. c6+ - and the final objective to fork king and rook on the 7th rank \n\n25...Kc8 26. cxd7+ Kxd7 27. Rfd1+",
        "20... exf3 21. dxc6 bxc6": "here black can also play 21...Qxd1, leading to a zwischenzug move cxb7+ before capturing back the queen to further open the king's position...",
        "22. Qxd7+": "to attract the rook to d7 ",
        "22... Rxd7 23. Nxa7+": "to coerce the king to b7 ",
        "23... Kb7 24. Nb5": "sacrificing the knight to vacate c6 ",
        "24... fxg2": "I was hoping for cxb5 to get to play c6+ with a fork on king and rook, missed this move... although I known it was possible for black to ignore the knight sacrifice!",
        "25. Rf3": "Now after seeing black seizing the initiative I need to defend h3",
        "25... g5 26. Nd4": "to get the knight to f5",
        "26... Rd5 27. fxg5": "opens the f column, with tempo, so my rook can support Nf5",
        "27... fxg5 28. Nf5": "forking the bishop and rook as referred before, now I aim to simplify the position and exchange as many pieces as possible so black doesn't have any counterplay ",
        "28... Rh7 29. Nxg7 Rxg7 30. Bb2": "Improving my bishop placement with tempo, now Bd4 is a possibility to block the d column and protect both my e3 and c5 pawns freeing my c1 rook to other functions ",
        "30... Rh7 31. Rc2": "threatens Rxg2, and avoids the skewer Rh1+ after: g4 hxg4",
        "31... g4 32. hxg4": "without the rook on c1 I can make this capture not fearing the skewer Rh1+",
        "32... Rd1+ 33. Kxg2": "only move, now if Rh1 Kg3 Rdg1+ (Rhg1+) Rg2 and I've achieved consolidation and can start pushing my pawns, or even play Bd4 first to secure my e and c pawns also"
