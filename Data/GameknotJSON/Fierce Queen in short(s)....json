        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6": "the Philidor defense: an ancient but strong defensive weapon for Black; if he knows, what must be done...",
        "3. d4 Nd7": "not a very usual move: better just exd4, Nxd4, Nf6, Nc3, Be7...",
        "4. Bc4": "not really intended as a threat: nonetheless, Black has to counter the pressure on f7 after an eventual Ng5 (or Ne5) somehow: best is Nb6, Bb3, exd4, Qxd4 (Nxd4?, c5!, and White always loses a piece after c4), Nf6...",
        "4... h6": "although it counters interference on g5, this is never a good move: it weakens the Kings' wing; this game, will make that very clear...",
        "5. O-O": "played too safe, because also Nc3 or Qe2, are strongly to be considered here: Blacks' center is under a lot of pressure already, after two weak moves...",
        "5... Be7": "right move, wrong time: it is high time, Black developed counterplay with Ngf6, Nc3 (too soon for dxe5, dxe5), Be7...",
        "6. Nc3": "played on auto-pilot: a shame, because at this point after dxe5, Nxe5 (dxe5, Qd5!), Nxe5, dxe5, Qh5!, White is already winning; but for some reason Whites' reasoning was blocked in the absence of Nf6: a very strange phenomena, not unusual in stronger players like myself...",
        "6... exd4": "by this time, Blacks' position is screaming for Ngf6, Be3, 0-0...",
        "7. Nxd4": "again auto-pilot, and White misses the strongest continuation: best is Qxd4, Bf6 (forced), Qd5/Qe3...",
        "7... c5": "Blacks' reluctancy to play Ngf6, is getting the better of him: this wil get him in trouble; Black has to prepare this with Nb6, but then follows Bb5+ and White gets the better of the play...",
        "8. Nf5": "also very much worth considering is Ndb5, Nb6 (forced, due to the threat Nxd6), Nd5!; but again, White misses it...",
        "8... Ne5 9. Bd5": "better Bb5+, or Nxe7: but White clings to the threat on f7...",
        "9... Bxf5 10. exf5 Rb8": "it is hard to understand, why Black keeps on refusing to play Nf6: after Nf6, Bxb7, Rb8, Bd5, Qd7, there is still lots to save...",
        "11. f4": "concluding Black's  fate: finally White is winning, after missing a handful of opportunities......",
        "11... Nd7": "considering Whites' obvious next move, better Nc6, followed by Nd4...",
        "12. Qh5": "finally, White gets to play out the final winning trump...",
        "12... g6": "a terrible move: only Ndf6 (Ngf6??, Qxf7 and mate), Qxf7+, Kd7, prevents more mayhem...",
        "13. fxg6": "Black created a monster: there is no cure against gxf7+; f6, g7!! mates, and Kf8, g7+, mates on the next move after Qf7...",
        "13... Ndf6": "forced: after Ngf6, g7!, Nxh5, gxh8Q+, Nf8, Qg8...",
        "14. gxf7+ Kf8": "a desparate attempt to stop Whites' killing attack, but losing even swifter: after Kd7, Qh3+ (forced), Kc7, Black is holding on much longer; this is still a 3+10 blitz game...",
        "15. fxg8=Q+": "or fxg8R+: after capturing on g8, mate follows on Qf7; so Black resigned this miniature mayhem..."
