        "3... Bf5 4. Nf3": "Not 4. Bd3 Bxd3 5. Qxd3 Qb6! 6. Nf3 Qa6 and Black gets a good game. This plan for Black was Nimzovich's idea.",

        "5... e6 6. O-O Be7 7. c4 Bg5": "?! dubious, sacrificing the \"minor exchange\" - bishop for knight",

        "19... Nc7 20. Bf5": "Perhaps I should have kept the bishops on the board, since Black's bishop is pretty bad compared to White's light-square bishop.",
        "20... Bxf5 21. Rxf5 Ne7 22. Rf3 Ng6 23. Be3": "Protecting the isolated d-pawn",

        "33... b6 34. a4 c5": "Black forgot about the pin, but this doesn't cost him any material. Eventually, this costs him the game.",
        "35. dxc5 bxc5 36. Bxc5 Nxc5 37. Re2xe6 Nxe6 38. Rxe6": "White's rook is much better placed than Black's.",
