    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "i like posting games with the nimzowitsch defense, i dont think ive faced a black oponent who used it once in my 200 games on this site. it also allows me to save some of the games i want to remember possible lines since im a free to play player ><",
        "1... Nc6 2. a3": "why i decided to post this game is this is a very Uncommon response i get to my opening which i think lead me to having a great game, since im used to playing vs the 3 most common/aggressive responses (d4 or nf5 or bb5 or even a rare Qf3)",
        "2... d5": "i saw it as an opening to grab the middle bring my queen out and other knight and start rolling with 3 pieces developped over his a3 pawn",
        "3. exd5": "the white doesnt know the classic \"to take is a mistake\" plays into what i planned.\n\n",
        "3... Qxd5 4. d3": "after seeing i was coming out aggressive i think he planned for a more defensive game.",
        "4... Nf6": "going on with my plan",
        "5. Nc3": "was sorta expecting the knight o move 4 was happy he let me take out my knight first",
        "5... Qe5+": "i always love offering the check here lol instead of retreating the queen, i am a gambler at heart and the games where my oponent blocks with either bishops is the ones i love.",
        "6. Be3": "i have to say i face Queen most of the time.  white bishop block the other times. rarely a block with the knight and even rarer with the black bishop, this delighted me cause now he had no way of immediately blocking my knight on the c6 from coming up. ",
        "6... Bg4 7. Qd2": "this guy was full of surprises. usually id face a bishop block or a knight development. obviously he cant promote the pawn cause my queen would take the black bishop (its what i was hoping he would do though lol) but this move was even more fun for me",
        "7... Nd4": "heres a bit more gambler in me was wondering if he would do bishop or knight but was still hoping pawn. the objective is the black bishop all along i was hoping i could achieve it without a cost on my previous move but that wasnt hidden enough.",
        "8. f3": "time to cause some disruption break his pawn line and get the bishop at a cost of my knight and im breaking this board open so thats perfect to trade knights out for his bishops.",
        "8... Nxc2+": "i dont think he expected this lol",
        "9. Qxc2 Qxe3+": "objective complete!",
        "10. Be2": "yet more surprises. he doesnt decided to cut the bleeding and maybe trade out queens he blocks with what i love the bishop!",
        "10... Bf5": "no need to waste my bishop and this diagonal is by far my favorite for my white bishop",
        "11. Nd1": "i felt my oponent had a very retreating playstyle it was time to also retreat and i wanted to finish development, allow my black bishop out and possibly castle",
        "11... Qb6 12. Qd2 e6 13. g4": "im always used to this kind of pressure and the defensive position hes adopted doesnt really allow him any development. im pretty sure opening his pawns at this stage is a weakening move",
        "13... Bg6 14. g5 Nd5": "i love my pawn disruption earlier makes for this knights new safe home",
        "15. f4": "he keeps going after my white bishop i think he knows i like that diagonal!",
        "15... h6": "time to open up his little hiding hut!",
        "16. Nf3": "hmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!!!! something is up he didnt come down with the pawn!",
        "16... O-O-O": "oh i see what hes doing the sneaky bastard! can you? ",
        "17. Ne5": "he pretended he wanted to kill my white bishop all along so i would keep moving it. but hes going for my rooks. i have a hard time believing he anticipated a queen side castle but if that is so i almost fell for his plan, so the wiser move here is to let him eat with his knight if he wants and look for a more aggressive line, \n\n",
        "17... Qd4": "my plan was to get my black bishop behind my queen use my rook in the open file the knight would create if he takes the  white bishop. but his plan was my rooks he saw i figured it out and retreated",
        "18. Nf3": "i decide to return to the previous state of game and see what his reply is.",
        "18... Qb6 19. b4": "wow as soon as he moved that i saw 2 ways to kill his queen can you?",
        "19... Nxb4": "what!? sacrifice a knight so unexpected. oh wait is it a sacrifice look at that black bishop and that queen in front of the king. wow are these games rare lol its like picture perfect placement with his too defensive style, after this move i had no clue what he would play.  \n\nall white players id appreciate if you posted his best reply. ",
        "20. Kf1": "by far i dont think this was it lol as the knight will continue his party. so rare i get to pawn hop undefended in a game with so many pieces left.",
        "20... Nxd3": "here again the picture perfect placement of my wsb rook and queen will cause the loss of his queen which i thought he would fall for 2 moves ago.",
        "21. Bxd3": "was there a better reply than that?, white players...",
        "21... Bxd3+ 22. Kg2": "was curious why he didnt take just now with the queen since i was getting it anyway.",
        "22... Bf1+ 23. Kxf1": "i was surprised he didnt take with his rook there. but then i see why he didnt take with his queen before he atleast also wants to be able to get the rook >< silly me i was a bit over confident maybe there was a way i could of salvaged a piece but at this stage i was happy getting the queen.",
        "23... Rxd2 24. Nxd2": "there ya go. i guess all is left is to try to figure out a checkmate. from here, it comes faster than expected lol",
        "24... hxg5": "lets open up some room for my rook",
        "25. fxg5 Rh5": "at this move i was out of \"plans\" temporarily, im making note here cause im sure there was alot more better moves. although oddly enough it turns out to play out like the previous \"picture perfect\" moments i had in the passed in this game lol.",
        "26. h4": "i was like \"great now what did i do but waste turns after playing a great game\" lol!\n\ni guess my new objective is digging my rook out. its just a matter of will my oponent let me.",
        "26... f6 27. Rb1": "i guess he wont, hes starting pressure on the queen but this open board will buy me many moves",
        "27... Qa6+": "my thought here is gain the check so i can eat 1 pawn and also i want to stay away from his knights until my rook is free,  ",
        "28. Kf2 fxg5": "after this entire game i had no clue what to expect from him here",
        "29. Nf3": "i guess his objective is my pawn and to confront my rook. but all im looking for is to free up my rook lol so this is fine.",
        "29... Bc5+ 30. Kg3": "i wonder if blocking with the knight might of been better with the hopes of connecting his rooks and bring them in to defend his king, might of been a better avenue.",
        "30... gxh4+": "as for me ill just keep gaining time and opening the board, his reply here will affect if i can checkmate him or not",
        "31. Nxh4": "after this i saw alot of checkmates can you? hes got alot of moves he can do to gain time but i dont know if he can come out of it on top, all replies are always appreciated and theory craft. i tried creating a puzzle from this position it took forever so obviously there is many ways to survive but he could only keep falling apart but the checkmate could be stretched out more than 20 moves. \n\nim wondering if there is a short way i didnt see in the puzzle (which i just gave up on to just come finish the game and see which move he would actually choose lo).  in this game it took the minimum amount moves too.",
        "31... Qd3+ 32. Kg4": "i guess he really wanted my rook",
        "32... Qe2+": "his longest way to surive is to block with the knight and lose his rook. but he kept refusing to lose pieces ",
        "33. Kg3 Bd6+": "my oponent went away for the full 3 days at this stage i just set up the conditional move",
        "34. Kh3 Qf3#": "the rook didnt need freeing up, \"picture perfect placement sorta >< the fact i tried clearing it though is what brought the pieces over. i love the ending here ending on a square the knight can theoritically attack but technically cant.\n\nhope you all enjoyed the game.\n\nall comments appreciated"
