        "1. e4": "hey hey lively chess crew! i like posting games with this gambit where there have been new move in it so i can save the lines. ive showed one with classical development. But this one is with a new \"irregular\" move, the game didnt last long but i want to save the early lines as facing rare replies are good to keep note of in my mind. you face those less often and may have less natural memory to them,",
        "1... Nc6": "and so my lovely nimzo! ive grown accustomed to it by now.  against players over 1800 rating it can fall short but its helped me climb from 1300 to the 1500 range with a good win ratio.  im also learning the budapest counter for d4 starters. and might start looking at the sicilian for higher opponents who go e4,",
        "2. Nf3": "my favorite gambit can only be played when white replies with nf3.  alot of whites will reply with d4 here and there are 2 ways to respond either e5 or d5, i personally choose d5 vs d4 reply ive learnt those lines alot more,",
        "2... f5": "and the gambit starts here. its called the colorado gambit.  initially played by a  player called Doug Root, i believe  he was able to win many games until grand masters were able to analyse flaws in this start but sub 1800 rating this gambit is extremely fun to play.",
        "3. exf5": "and so he decides to accept my gambit",
        "3... d5": "proper reply",
        "4. d3": "this is the first time i face this situation. where a white does not take out his LSB before playing his d pawn. much less i never anticipated him to block his LSB in... hmm uncharted waters. ill develop naturaly for a move or 2 still and see if what develops",
        "4... Bxf5": "recapture + development",
        "5. Bf4": "hmmm not nc3 nor Bg5. this is really unexpected. i have to think to myself. is this opponent familiar with the opening im using or is he also just going with the flow having not faced the colorado gambit before.",
        "5... Bg4": "usually i wouldve been able to play e5 but since he has double coverage on that square i couldnt play that yet. so i decide to pin his knight to induce a pawn weakness or allow e5 depending on his reply.",
        "6. Be2": "reinforces the knight. very wise choice or else i couldve played nd4 threatning a double pawn,  here i took a long time to what my reply should be. and playing e5 is no longer viable. i dont want to move any left side or right side pawns to have both castle options open. playing nf6 is developing but doesnt help the situation on e5 and creates alot more tension because he could now play his knight on e5 blocking my pawn, and moving my queen now doesnt seem wise with 3 of his pieces live with blind attacks.",
        "6... d4": "so im happy i faced an irregular game like this where an opponent didnt develop his d pawn at all and playing d4 is a wise crunch. so i choose to replay this move that was great. i also remembered that trying to fight for the e5 square in that fight wouldve led to my demise. but i can set a trap up with the e5 square.  and it was wiser to castle long during that game. so now i can also move my king side pawns",
        "7. Nbd2": "the d4 prevents nc3 obviously. he also cant take the pawn with his knight. i can hold back my epawn until i consolidate some material off the board and relieve some tension. so i analysed that the f knight and the DSB are the culprits that have to leave the board,.",
        "7... Nf6": "so i decide to help provide cover to the bishop incase he does choose to play ne5 and it further helps develop",
        "8. Nb3": "hmm going after my d4 pawn. i cannot let that happen. time to take attack the culprits i want to take off the board",
        "8... Nh5": "if he takes my d4 pawn he loses his bishop. i would hope to induce a pawn reinforcement. or that he would go to d2",
        "9. Be5": "hmmm unanticpated reply. and has now triple attack on my d4 pawn. but he placed both the 2 units i wanted off the board within attacks reach",
        "9... Bxf3": "and so force the bishop retake first and itll be an even trade but i get both the 2 enemies of the e5 square off the board",
        "10. Bxf3 Nxe5": "gulp and gulp",
        "11. Bxh5+": "and since im queen side castling. pinning my knight isnt wise even though i do want the e5 square open.  playing the pawn is safer",
        "11... g6 12. f4": "hmmm un anticipated reply.  taking the bishop isnt wise as he gets a pawn up in the exchange and a queen check on h5 with a pawn on e5.  so i decide that both of us conserving material is wiser. i played the pawn anyway to kick the bishop away.  his attack on my knight is sorta a time gainer for me to move out of the e5 square. and sets up my trap",
        "12... Nf7": "and so now i play here to cover the e5 square possibly play nh6 if he decides to push his pawn should i try to attack it with g5.  ",
        "13. Bg4": "my opponent temporarily blocks my long castle. i analysed many courses and then saw a nice trap. where e5 if he is the attacker of that square again can really hurt him. like in my last game. if i played in a way to not have a focus there but a time gain when he would attack it could be deadly.",
        "13... e5 14. fxe5": "hmm he takes shouldnt off i can retake now with my knight but i dont want that lsb to move",
        "14... Bb4+": "check! if he promotes pawn its a pawn down exchange with a possible danger to his rook and a high chance of losing his castle. so knight defence looks wiser",
        "15. Nd2 Bxd2+": "but taking the knight forces a loss of castle or a displacement of the queen. ",
        "16. Qxd2": "my opponent chose to save his castle",
        "16... Qh4+": "losing exchange. im sad my opponent resigned at this stage. bishop pawn down would be hard to play with a pawn on d4 i take it.  he was playing very aggressively.  im happy i annotate these types of games. it served me well to not panic in new situations\n\nall comments appreciated,  if he my opponent choose to retake with king. i recapture pawn with knight gain time on the lsb and possibly get the chance to finally castle long. i may be forced to advance the king side pawns first. but i think black has a nice board set up with an open view to the king"
