        "5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Bd2": "This is an interesting move I picked up from my chess coach Vojislav Milanovic. The idea is to take on c3 with the bishop to effectively prevent a future c5.\n",
        "6... O-O 7. e4 Nxc3 8. Bxc3 Nc6": "This is the right idea but the wrong move. Much better is c5 to put instant pressure on the center and then to maybe follow up with Nc6.\n",
