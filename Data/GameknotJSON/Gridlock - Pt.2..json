        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nPicture the scene - you are in a single piece ending, you have a bishop, your opponent has a knight.  You are a pawn up.  Then the game ends in a draw and for me a low draw at that.  You wonder - how did it all go wrong.  Well here goes.  After facing many Sicilians I now get a Petrov.  This is when black plays 2...... Nf6 instead of Nc6.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nxe4": "3. ........ Nxe5 - central pawn trade.",
        "4. Qe2 Qe7": "4....... Qe7 - Nf6?? drops the queen to the discovery 5. Nc6+.",
        "5. Qxe4 d6 6. d4 dxe5 7. dxe5": "7. dxe5 - now the knights are exchanged.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nc3 Qxe5 9. Qxe5+ Nxe5": "9. ........ Nxe5 - now a queen trade.",
        "10. Nb5": "10. Nb5 - attacking c7.",
        "10... Bd6 11. Nxd6+ cxd6": "11. ...... cxd6 - a N for B trade, isolating the d pawn making it a target later on.",
        "12. Be3 O-O 13. O-O-O": "13. 0-0-0 - with the queens off the board I prefer queenside castling or to leave Henry in the centre.",
        "13... Rd8 14. Be2 Bf5 15. c3 b6 16. h3": "16. h3 - prophylaxis here.  I do not want horsies on g4 thank you!",
        "16... h6 17. Rd2 d5 18. Rhd1": "18. Rhd1 - doubling up on the d column.",
        "18... Be6 19. Bf4 Ng6 20. Bg3 Rd7": "20. ....... Rd7? - loses pawn to 21. Bb5!",
        "21. Bb5 Rdd8 22. Bc6 Rac8 23. Bxd5 Rde8 24. Bxe6 Rxe6": "24. ...... Rxe6 - bishop trade.",
        "25. Rd2d8+ Rxd8 26. Rxd8+": "26. Rxd8+ - now a rook trade.",
        "26... Kh7 27. Rd7 Re7 28. Rxe7 Nxe7": "28. ...... Nxe7 - a rook trade and a draw offer which I decline as at this stage I felt I should win this, a pawn up in an open board.  A few moves down the line, things are going to change quite a bit, however!",
        "29. c4": "29. c4 - preparing to make a passer on the b or c file.",
        "29... Kg6 30. Kd2 Kf5 31. Ke3": "31. Ke3 - both kings centralise themselves for the endgame.",
        "31... Nc6 32. Bd6 h5 33. b4 g5 34. a3": "34. a3 - to add additional support to my b pawn should Fou Lenoir have to move from his lofty dias!",
        "34... Ke6 35. Bh2 f5 36. f4": "34. f4 - seemed a good idea at the time, trying to break up black's pawn wall but black's next move makes me think again.",
        "36... g4 37. h4": "37. h4.  I felt that if I took on g4 then black would take with the f pawn and not the h pawn.  I did not want to risk black getting a passer on the h file.  This becomes the first stage of the gridlock process however.",
        "37... Kd6 38. g3 a5 39. b5 Nd8 40. Kd3 Ne6": "40. ..... Ne6 - this horsie is going to be mega-annoying as you will see.",
        "41. Bg1 Nc5+": "41. ...... Nc5+ - I thought about Bxc5+ but then black would take back with the pawn and next move play a4!  Although it is a K & P ending there is no way past the third rank for Henry so that would be a draw as all the enemy king would have to do is shuttle from c7 to b7 ad infinitum.",
        "42. Kc2": "42. ..... Kc2 - here I was hoping for the following:- Variation A 42. Kc2 a4 43. Kc3 Kc7 44. Kb4 Ne4 45. Kxa4 Nxg3 46. Kb4 Ne2 47. Be3 g3 48. a4 g2 49. a5 bxa5+ 50. Kxa5 g1=Q 51.

        "42... Nd7": "42. ....... Nd7!! - this move ensures the draw for black.  All the black king now has to do is to shuttle from e6 to d6 ad infinitum as the horsie and the b pawn stops the pawn on c4 advancing.  With a heavy heart I move Fou Lenoir to f2 and offer a draw of which my opponent accepts.",
