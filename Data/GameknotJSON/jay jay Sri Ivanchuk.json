        "4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. O-O Be7 7. cxd5 Nxd5": "I would have expected 7...,exd5; 8.dxc5;\r\nBlack has an isolated center pawn, but he also takes the initiave.",
        "8. Nc3 Nf6": "Another move with the same piece, this should give me the lead in development",
        "9. Bf4": "Fighting over control of e5, hoping to play Ne5",
        "9... a6 10. Qa4": "This move took me a lot of thought.\r\nAfter carefull consideration I concluded blacks next move was harmless.\r\n",
        "10... Bd7 11. dxc5": "Whites idea is playing Rd1 and Ne5,  combining forces against d7 and c6;\r\nIf he can white would also like to keep the c5 pawn, after say 11....,Ne5?!, Qc4;",
        "11... Bxc5 12. Qc4": "Moving the Queen ou of harms way",
        "12... Ba7 13. Bd6": "Hoping to pin the black king in the center",
        "13... Rc8 14. Qh4 Ne7 15. Ba3": "Better is an immediate Ng5, with some tactical play against blacks kingside.\r\nTHis is one reason the white Queen went to h4",
        "15... Bc5": "Annihilating the pin, white completely missed this move",
        "16. Bxc5": "The only way to continue, but much of whites initiative is gone now",

        "21... Ra5": "White still has a dangerous initiative, but to many pieces have been exchanged.\r\nBlack has good odds of equalizing",
        "22. Qd3 O-O 23. Rfd1": "Now back surrendered, saying \"I must be blind\"\r\nThe strange thing is he still can play Rd5.\r\n\r\nThen we could have 24.Qxa6, Bb5; 25,Rxd5; Qxd5; 26.Qxb6 whcih threatens Nf6+;\r\n\r\nProbably black has to accept losing a pawn, but that should be the worst of it\r\n\r\n"
