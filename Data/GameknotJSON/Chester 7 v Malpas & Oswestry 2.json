        "1. d4": "I approached this game carefully. My opponent was only 11 years old, and I was mindful of how I lost once to a Chester youngster with a similar age and a similar grade. https://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/chester7vpenyffordd2wirral-league?gm=49458",
        "1... d5": "So he copies my first move.",
        "2. c4": "Queen's Gambit",
        "2... e6": "Declined variation.",
        "3. Nc3": "Normal development",
        "3... Nf6": "And from him.",
        "4. Bg5": "Bishop comes out.",
        "4... Be7": "So does his.",
        "5. e3": "Preparing to develop my Bf1",
        "5... h6": "he puts the question to my bishop.",
        "6. Bh4": "I drop back.",
        "6... Ne4": "He plays the Lasker variation... known to be a bit drawish. https://www.chess.com/article/view/lasker-s-queen-s-gambit-declined",
        "7. Bxe7": "So I take.",
        "7... Qxe7": "He takes back.\n",
        "8. Nxe4": "I take the knight.",
        "8... dxe4": "He takes back - and the question is how to continue? I can see now in the opening databases that Ne2 is usually played here, but I was a bit afraid of the queen check on b4 and decided to stop it.\n ",
        "9. Qd2": "With this...Fritz prefers Ne2.",
        "9... O-O": "So he develops. ",
        "10. Ne2": "Now the knight comes out. Fritz thinks it is level.",
        "10... Rd8": "A fairly logical place to put the rook.",
        "11. Nc3": "I attack the pawn on e4 and prepare tp develop Bf1.",
        "11... Nc6": "But what is this? Just gifting the pawn on e4?",
        "12. Nxe4": "So I take.",
        "12... b6": "He prepares to fianchetto his Bc8.",
        "13. Bd3": "I develop mine, protecting the Ne4.",
        "13... Bb7": "He continues to fianchetto.",
        "14. O-O": "I castle.",
        "14... Rd7": "Preparing to double rooks on the d file.",
        "15. a3": "Ruling out his knight or queen coming to b4 and also preparing to grab territory on the queen side.",
        "15... Na5": "Hoping for a knight fork on b3. ",
        "16. Qc3": "Which I prevent.",
        "16... Rad8": "He completes his doubling manoeuvre on the d file.",
        "17. b4": "So I attack his knight.",
        "17... Nc6": "Knight drops back. Fritz outs white as plus .97 now.",
        "18. f3": "This seemed sensible at the time, giving more protection to my Ne4, but I soon realised it is a mistake. He could now cause problems with 18......f7-f5, forcing my knight away and then continue with 19....f5-f4 undermining my pawn on d4 which is holding everything together.",
        "18... Nb8": "Fritz agrees with me - f5 followed by f4 and white's advantage is down to plus 0.81 This move seems far too passive. I think his plan was c7-c5",
        "19. b5": "Which I decide to stop. I am planning on meeting c7-c5 with bxc6 e.p.",
        "19... a6": "He tries to lure my pawn away.",
        "20. a4": "But I simply protect it. Fritz prefers f3-f4 here.",
        "20... c6": "He attacks b5 again, but this leaves his pawn on b6 very weak. I was rather afraid of him playing c6-c5 next move, hence my reply.",
        "21. bxc6": "Fritz likes this move too!",
        "21... Nxc6": "He takes back.",
        "22. Rab1": "I attack b6. Fritz likes this too.",
        "22... f5": "But now this move comes in at last.",
        "23. Ng3": "I play this with the idea of meeting 23,,,,,f5-f4 with 24. exf4 Nxd4 25. Be4 and my Ng3 keeps the e2 square under control, stopping a nasty knight fork on that square. Fritz prefers 23. Nf2.",
        "23... Ne5": "An ingenious move, if I take the knight on e5 then my bishop on d3 goes to his rook and the advantage has passed to black. Fortunately I don't have to take it.",
        "24. Bc2": "Fritz agrees that this is the best move, and give the position as plus 2 to white now.",
        "24... Nc6": "He sees nothing better than retreating the knight.",
        "25. Ne2": "Now if he plays f5-f4 I simply take with the knight. There is no rush to take the b pawn, it can't escape.",
        "25... Nb8": "Knight retreats yet again!",
        "26. Rxb6": "So I take.",
        "26... Rd7d6": "He challenges the rook. Fritz also now likes 27. a5 protecting the rook, with plus 3 to white, but I do something else.",
        "27. Rfb1": "Also plus 3 to white.",
        "27... Rxb6": "Black takes.",
        "28. Rxb6": "I take back, planning on meeting Rd6 with Qb4.",
        "28... Qc7": "Attack my rook, but.....",
        "29. Rxe6": "But this goes. Plus 3.75 to white now.",
        "29... Rc8": "With the threat of Qxc4 but I am ready for it.",
        "30. Bxf5": "Now 30....Qxc4 can be met with 31. Re8+ or with exchanging queens and then playing Re8+. In either case white has a winning advantage.",
        "30... Qf7": "So his queen hurries over to protect his king-side",
        "31. Qd3": "I protect my bishop.",
        "31... Rf8": "His rook comes over to attack my bishop again.",
        "32. Bh7+": "I throw in a check.",
        "32... Kh8": "Forced of course.",
        "33. Nf4": "Protecting my rook and threatening a horrible check on g6. Plus 7.41 to white now, according to Fritz.",
        "33... g5": "He gives his king some space. Fritz now likes Rxh6",
        "34. Ng6+": "But I prefer this way.",
        "34... Kxh7": "He takes the bishop. Fritz is now crying out for Ne7+ but again I go along another path.",
        "35. Re7": "I decide to win his queen.",
        "35... Qxe7": "This leads to his mate. Fritz thinks that Kg8 was best, but still gives it as almost plus 9 to white.",
        "36. Nxe7+": "White is mating now.",
        "36... Kg7": "There is nothing better. https://gameknot.com/chess-puzzle.pl?pz=220833",
        "37. Qg6+": "Queen check.",
        "37... Kh8": "King retreats.",
        "38. Qxh6#": "And is now mated. Thanks for reading. Please let me know how I am getting on with stars and/or a few comments. Until next time dear reader!"
