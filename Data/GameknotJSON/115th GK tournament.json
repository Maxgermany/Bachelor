        "1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c6 3. e3": "Refraining from the typical 3.d4 with 3.e3 wanting to maintain the English formation.",
        "3... d5 4. Nc3 a6": "4..d6 is the most popular choice to achieve a solid centre but Black decides on playing at the left wing instead with 4..a6",
        "5. b4": "5.b4?!\nOnly two games were played in this line, Staniszewski-Burmakin (Cappelle la Grande 2003) and Rehorek-Gregor (Ricany 2011). Interestingly, both games ended with wins for Black! If Black continued developing his centre, White would end up with less space going into the middle phase of the game.",
        "5... b5": "5..b5?!\n5..e5 was better with the idea of taking the centre.",
        "6. c5 Nbd7": "6..Nbd7? allows a4 and White would have a nice solid structure at the left side of the board.",
        "7. a4 Rb8 8. axb5 axb5 9. Bb2": "9. Bb2?\n9. d4 would've been a better move in the long run. But Black would allow d4 in the next move with his passive 10..g6",
        "9... g6 10. d4 Bg7 11. Bd3 O-O 12. O-O Qc7 13. Re1 e5 14. e4": "14.e4\nThe pawn push of 13..e5 has no immediate threat so White continues with 14.e4, challenging Black's intentions.",
        "14... exd4 15. Nxd4 dxe4 16. Nxe4 Nxe4 17. Bxe4 Ne5 18. Bc1 f5": "After the storm has cleared, Black is trying to equalize. But 18..f5 opens the a2-g8 diagonal so the Bishop retreat will also threat checks to the Black king.",
        "19. Bc2 Ng4 20. g3 Bxd4": "20..Bxg4??\nSacrificing his only defender of the King for the Knight is a mistake.\nAfter 21. Bb3+ Kg7, 22.Qxd4+ would have came with check and a similar endgame would occur on the board.",
        "21. Qxd4 Qg7": "Already, Black is worse with three heavy pieces aiming diagonally at his exposed King.",
        "22. Bb3+ Kh8 23. Bb2 Qxd4 24. Bxd4+ Nf6": "After 24..Ne6, also possible was Re8!\nBut I went for something simpler but nonetheless still wins.",
        "25. Bxf6+ Rxf6 26. Re8+ Kg7 27. Re7+": "27. Re7+ is rather inaccurate. Ra7+ followed by Rc7 would have won the bishop.\nBut by this point, I was only focusing on the King.",
        "27... Kh6 28. Raa7 Kg5": "28..Kg5?? leads to mate in 3 in different ways starting with 29.f4+",
        "29. Rexh7": "29. Rxh7?, missing the mate in 3. ",
        "29... Be6": "29..Be6??\n29..f4 would've prolonged the game a bit more. Now 30. f4+ is mate in 2.",
        "30. h4+": "30.h4+??\nMissing the mate again!",
        "30... Kg4 31. Bd1+ Kh3": "At this point the computer finds a mate in 7 starting Ra3.",
        "32. Ra3 f4 33. gxf4+": "Black resigned in view of 33..Bb3 34.Rxb3#"
