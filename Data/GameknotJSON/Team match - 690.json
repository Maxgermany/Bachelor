        "8. a4 Bc5": "i asume he is gonna do ng4 next so i got some time here becasue i can answer ng4 with d4 so i figured my bes bet was to retake the gambit pawn.",

Nd6+ Kd8": "at this point i relize a mate if i can get the bishop to c7, all i got to do is check the king again at f7 and he'll move it back for me to move the bishop into place. so let me rearrange my pieces so i can capitalize on this, first of all the hanging knight on g4.",

        "23. O-O": "its all over i only see moving his queen as the saving move but he cannot move it unless he trades so he should trade, but even after the trade my game is much better as my rooks can do the damage in a few moves.",
