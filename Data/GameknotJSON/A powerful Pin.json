        "4. e3 d6": "a bit passive",
        "5. Bd3 g6 6. c4 Bg7 7. b4": "now .. black has a space disadvantage",
        "7... O-O 8. Bb2 Re8": "This was to prepare e5 when white may play d5 and black Knight returns to\r\nb8 in the style of Kings Indian ?",
        "9. Qc2 a6": "afraid of getting completely over run ! stopping b5\r\n",
        "10. O-O e5 11. dxe5": "Thought white might have played d5 instead when it would be difficult for black to over come space disadvantage !",
        "11... dxe5 12. e4": "preventing the obvious ..d5 which would fork two pieces but I am not convinced .. white may have been better not to close in his white bishop (maybe Nb1 to d2)",
        "12... Bg4": "just trying to get pieces developed quickly as I felt backward in development . ",
        "13. Nbd2": "I thought here for long time trying to find a way forward .. what options has black here ? can anyone see a decent plan ?",
        "13... Nd7": "Probably has drawbacks ..But this is what I decided upon ..hoping to play f5",
        "14. h3 Be6 15. Nb3": "here white is thinking of playing Knight to C5 ..again I was stumped as to what to play (normal moves seemed to devalue my position) .. in the end I came up with an idea !",
        "15... Nf8": "letting the white Knight come to C5",
        "16. Nc5 Bc8": "needed to protect b7",
        "17. Rfd1 Ne6": "played this as I thought I might be able to secure a knight on d4 and block\r\nthe white rook if needed to do so.",
        "18. Nxe6 Bxe6 19. Be2 Nd4 20. Bxd4 exd4 21. Bd3 Qd7 22. Ng5": "the light squared bishop is doomed..I blocked its escape when I played Qd7\r\n.. It is o.k however I think ! as it did not have many squares !\r\nOpposite coloured bishops ..often give the weaker side chances of obtaining draw in end game",
        "22... Rad8 23. Rde1 Be5": "stopping f4",
        "24. Rad1 c5": "black needs to take action and disrupt whites pawns ?",
        "25. Nxe6 Rxe6 26. Ref1 Bf4": "again to stop f4",
        "27. Rfe1 Re5": "stopping pawn and protecting c5 ..if bxc then I can take back with rook and perhaps double rooks on C-file",
        "28. Be2 b6 29. bxc5 bxc5": "must have changed my mind ? perhaps thinking about occupying the b file with rook",

This is probably good sometimes, I used to play moves like this myself, however I can't help but think that the Bishop is badly placed (is it better on b1-h7 diagonal or h1-a8)",
        "42... Rb6": "This is to secure e6 square - the rook an the queen prevent e6 and blck needs to play f6",
        "43. a4 f6 44. exf6 Bxf6 45. Re2 Re6 46. Re4 Kf7 47. Kg2": "This offers black great chances ",

        "48. Kf3 Kg8": "safety first",
        "49. Qb1": "note if black King was still on f7 then white now plays Be8  and wins the black queen",
