        "1. d4": "I recommend all viewers to use the \"interactive\" button to look through these games.",
        "1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3": "White avoids the Nimzo-Indian, if 3. Nc3 black can play Bb4.",
        "3... c5": "Attacking the centre.",
        "4. g3": "Looks like a Catalan but with c5.",
        "4... d5": "A Tarrash-like move, enabling white to give black an isolated d pawn.",
        "5. cxd5 cxd4": "This move loses a pawn (black can regain it later but with compensation for white as the game will show).",
        "6. dxe6 Bxe6 7. Qxd4": "White wins a pawn for little compensation.",
        "7... Nc6 8. Qxd8+ Rxd8 9. Bg2 Nb4": "White is playing safe, but here Nc2+ is threatened so Na3 is forced, giving up the a pawn.",
        "10. Na3 Bxa2 11. O-O": "It is important to mention that an \"a\" pawn isn't exactly the same as a \"d\" pawn, plus it's clear that black went out of his way to take it - just look at the light bishop and knight. Black is neglecting castling a bit too much, which white will demonstrate it to be a (potentially, perhaps you see a way to defend) decisive mistake.",
        "11... a6": "Black should play Be7 and castle immediately but instead delays it to protect the b5 square. In reality, if after Be7 Nb5 and castle white decides to take the a7 pawn, Bc5! The knight can't get out easily, the e2 pawn is threatened, and if white protects it with Re1, Nc2 fork!",
        "12. Bg5": "A natural move.",
        "12... Be7": "Unfortunately it's too late to castle.",
        "13. Nc2": "Black should just take on c2 and be happy to live without a bishop pair (the knight could go back to c6 later).",
        "13... Bc4": "It's too risky to try to grab the \"e\" pawn at the moment, but black still tries.",
        "14. Nxb4 Bxb4": "Perhaps Bxf6 would be good, but white didn't want to give up the bishop.",
        "15. Rfd1": "White ignores the \"e\" pawn, since its importance is illusionary.",
        "15... Rxd1+ 16. Rxd1 Bxe2 17. Rd4 Bxf3 18. Bxf3 Bc5": "Black is trying to hold on, but it's difficult. An engine evaluation suggests that the white has an advantage.",
        "19. Rc4 b6 20. b4 Be7 21. Rc7": "Black's rook is really out of play at this point.",
        "21... Kd8 22. Ra7 Rf8 23. Be3 Nd7 24. Bc6 Nb8 25. Bxb6+ Kc8 26. Rc7+ Kd8 27. Ba4": "The mate is unpreventable and black is forced to resign."
