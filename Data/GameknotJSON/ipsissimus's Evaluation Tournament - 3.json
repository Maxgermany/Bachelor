        "11. g5": "Good attack, probably a bit to hearly (11.Rg1 would have prepared it)",
        "11... Nd7 12. Bg2": "Mistake. It menaces a further e4 but doesn't prevent black's counterattack on g5",
        "12... O-O-O": "Black castle on his strong side.",
        "13. Nf2": "Black has now, as this is the case in this kind of openning (hypermodern chess, if I'm correct), a far better control on the center and white an advance on one side. but this is a blunder which will cost white's 1 pawn and this advance.",
        "13... hxg5 14. h5": "Mistake, white should have taken the pawn. Now black will have it for free.",
        "14... Nf6 15. h6 gxh6": "Now, white's advance on the kingside is broken. The no mans land between the 2 armies is on white side of the board : black controls more space. The next assault is about to begin.",
        "16. d4": "White carrieson attacking, not such a bad idea because he doesn 't have to let the initiative to black who has material advantage and several attacking options with the centralised bishops and knights (right or left side and center)",
        "16... exd4 17. exd4": "Now, the next black's plan is to take control of the e file.",
        "17... Bf4+": "I doubt it's such a good move, for 18. Nd3 could be efficient against it.",
        "18. Kb1": "Forced if white doesn't want to lose material",
        "18... Rde8 19. Na4": "weak moves. It enables the DSB to protect d4 which is exposed but which black can harly attack... but it doesn't prevent black's plan. Nd3 would have been better to menace the dangerous black DSB.",
        "19... Bf5": "... At this point I hesitated because Qb4?! or Qd6 might have been better.",
        "20. Qxe7 Rxe7": "black controls or contests 45 squares against 30 for white.\nkings are safe, black is in advance in material, black is far better on the center and controls the open file. His pieces poorly protect each other but the 2 bishops directed on the king are very dangerous. ",
        "21. Nd3": "White is still on attack",
        "21... Bd6": "Black retreats",
        "22. Ne5": "mistake : white should group his pieces before attacking again. In the following trades, black wins another pawn.",
        "22... Nxe5 23. dxe5 Bxe5 24. Ba3": "The position is annoying for black : the pieces are not well placed. Black has to reorganise his game.\nBut the material advance and center control widely compensate.",
        "24... Ree8 25. Bh3 Bxh3": "Forced trade.White gets rid of a dangerously placed bishop and Black loses the 2 bishops advantage but the trades favours material advance",
        "26. Rxh3 d4": "Black wants to move the knight, so that the pawn has to be protected by another piece.",
        "27. Rhh1 Nd7": "so that the DSB can retreat and still protect the d pawn and open the e file for a rook move. Furthermore, the knight on d7 covers c5",
        "28. Rd3": "Probably to double the rooks on the d file but 28. Re1 might have been better, trying to challenge the open e file",
        "28... Bg7": "Now, black is ready for the attack.",
        "29. Bc1": "To prepare a further f4",
        "29... b5": "Now that the black pieces are in correct order, black begins his attack and will quickly regain field.",
        "30. Nb2 Nc5 31. Rdd1 Re2": "Black controls now 2 third of the board.",
        "32. Nd3": "Preventing 32. ... d3 which would have been terrible for white",
        "32... Nxd3": "trading is good for the one in advance of material",
        "33. Rxd3 Rhe8": "Doubling the rooks on the open file",
        "34. Kb2": "to prevent a pin on c1 ",
        "34... Rf2": "preparing 35. ... Re e2",
        "35. f4": "?",
        "35... gxf4": "black has doubled pawns on the f file and a bad pawn structure but 4 pawns advance and 3 passed pawns largely compensate.",
        "36. b4": "weak move but white is anyway cramped.",
        "36... Ree2": "white's c pawn is doomed",
        "37. Kb1 Rexc2 38. a3": "to protect the b  pawn.",
        "38... Rc3": "offering a trade",
        "39. Rhd1 Rc4 40. Bd2 Kd7 41. Bc3 Kc6": "The black king should come as close of the center as possible for the endgame.",
        "42. Bxd4": "beginning of the trading sequence",
        "42... Bxd4 43. Rd3xd4 Rxd4 44. Rxd4": "Black has lost a pawn in the trading sequence but it doesn't matter, white has not enough material left to prevent a pawn promotion.",
        "44... h5 45. Rd1 h4 46. Re1 h3": "I hesitate to play 46. Rg2, which would have permit to the rook to protect any of the pawns. The 2 moves win but I do not know which is the best.",
        "47. Rh1": "menacing the h pawn",
        "47... h2 48. Rc1+ Kb7 49. Ka1 Rg2 50. a4 Rg1 51. axb5 Rxc1+ 52. Kb2 h1=Q": "Not a bad game from interpidpixie, intrepid indeed :) : the attacks where not prepared enough so that black could counter, gaining a little advantage. "
