O-O Nf6 6. d4 exd4 7. cxd4 Be7 8. e5 dxe5 9. dxe5": "this is what it looks like, if you end up on the wrong side of a random Philidor defense; there are a lot of strong players, that use ancient openings like this, just to get by. Only few of them, know the real intricacies... Black is about to embark on a very unpleasant tour...",
        "9... Nfd7": "better would have been Qxd1, Rxd1, Ne4, Be3, Bc5, Nd4, Nd7, and set up some decent defense... this gives White the chance to play out a simple and dangerous move...",
        "10. e6": "even stronger, would have been postponing this strong move with something like Qc2, or even Qb3; but in these kind of blitz games - 3 + 10 - you simply do not have the time to work all that out... you make a plan, and you stick to it...",
        "10... fxe6 11. Bxe6": "the plan is clear: if Nd7 buckles, we trade Queens in a better position for White... on top of that, Black cannot castle for a while; the White LSB has a nice square on b3...",
        "11... Nc6 12. Re1 Nf6 13. Qxd8+ Nxd8 14. Bb3": "certainly not the best continuation for both players, but who is to judge? White held some advantage, after trading Queens...but now, Black is embarking on a really dangerous tour...",
        "14... Bd7 15. Nc3": "already winning is Nh4!, with the potent threat of Ng6; not very much, Black can do about it...",
        "15... Nc6 16. Bf4 Bg4 17. Bxc7 Bxf3 18. gxf3 Nd4 19. Bd6": "there is no doubt, that both players could have done better in the past few moves; but anyhow, White succeeded in gaining a winning edge... Be7 is all but gone...",
        "19... Nxf3+ 20. Kg2 Nxe1+ 21. Rxe1": "20. Kf1, had been stronger, but Whites' advantage still holds...",
        "21... Nh5": "already, Black is breaking: after Kd7, Bxe7, Rae8, Ba4+, b5, there were still fighting chances... but I underestimated the threat of Nh5-f4+...",
        "22. Rxe7+ Kd8": "Kf8, Re5 is mate...",
        "23. Rxb7": "absolutely winning is Nd5, followed by Rxb7, but I did not find it...",
        "23... Rc8 24. Be7+ Ke8 25. Ba4+": "it is always hard, to find the win in a winning position; Ne4!, is leading straight to mate, after Nd6+...",
        "25... Kf7 26. Bh4+ Ke6 27. Bd7+ Kd6 28. Ne4+ Ke5": "by now, I was surprised by how many chances the Black King had left; and got intimidated...",
        "29. f3": "still winning, but after a simple Bxc8, Rxc8, Re7+, we have it all...",
        "29... Rc2+": "Nf4+, would have been more cumbersome; and I got even more intimidated... none off this would have happened, if I had played 20. Kf1...",
        "30. Kh3": "after simply Bf2, Nf4+, Kg3, White has nothing to worry... this is bad...",
        "30... Rf8": "missing Nf4+, Kg4 (Kg3, Rg2 is mate), h5+ (Rg2+, Ng3/Bg3+ solves all), Kg5, Rg2+, with lots of complications for White...",
        "31. Bg4": "following the wrong plan: still easily winning was Bg3+, Nxg3, Kxg3; suddenly, White is losing...",
        "31... Nf4+ 32. Kg3 Ne2+": "Rg2 mates, but Black misses it: Divine Justice?",
        "33. Kf2 Nf4+ 34. Ke1": "still holding some advantage, was Kf1, Rc1+, Be1, h5, Re7+, Kd5, Bd7; after this, the position is totally equal...",
        "34... Nd3+": "after Ng2+, Kd1, Ne3+, Black reaches perpetual check...",
        "35. Kd1 Rg2": "too late for Black, to count blessings; best is probably Rxb2, and make the most of it... now, its Whites' turn...",
        "36. Bg3+": "directly winning is Rd7!, Nxb2+ (forced), Kc1, Rc8+, Kb1!...",
        "36... Kd4 37. Rd7+ Ke3 38. Re7 Nxb2+ 39. Kc1": "as planned?",
        "39... Rd8": "planning on Rd1 mate; best was Nd3+, Kb1, Kd4, and get out of the line of fire...",
        "40. Nc3+": "still holding advantage: winning was Nc5+, Kd4, Ne6+... ",
        "40... Kd3": "Black is reaching the end of his tether; after just Be5, Rc2+, Kb1, there is nothing left to play... but I could not find it...",
        "41. Bf5+": "a terrible move, totally equalizing all threats...",
        "41... Kxc3 42. Be5+": "the move, I was counting on; but it means nothing...",
        "42... Kb4": "there must be a heaven for blitz players: after Rd4!, White has to fight against mating threats; best is Rxg7, Rf2, Bxd4+, Kxd4, Bc2, for a fairly equal position...",
        "43. Rb7+ Ka3": "running right into trouble: after Kc4, Rc7+, Kb5!, Bxb2, g5!, Black can fight on...",
        "44. Bxb2+": "now, after Rxb2, Rxb2, Rd1+, Kxd1, Kxb2, Be6, the fight would be over; but not lost by a long shot, because we are still playing on time... but Black was starting to suffer lack of time...",
        "44... Kxa2": "a terrible move: Bb1 mates at once... but I failed to find it; weary from the fight...",
        "45. Be6+": "but I found this one: after Rd5 - the only one - Bxd5 mates; in this position, Black ran out of time: White still had 4:04 on the clock... I truly believe, there is a heaven for blitz..."
