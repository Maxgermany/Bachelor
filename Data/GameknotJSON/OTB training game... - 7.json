        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4": "this used to be my favourite for a long time, so I know this type of opening to the bare bones of it...",
        "3... Nf6": "inaccurate: theory dictates Bc5, c3, Nf6, d4, leading to Giuoco Piano, whereas d3 would lead to Giuoco Pianissimo; both breeds of the Italian Party...",
        "4. Ng5": "here is why...",
        "4... d5 5. exd5 Nxd5": "another option is Na5, Bb5+, c6, dxc6, bxc6, Qf3!: the Blackburne variation; after cxb5?, of course Qxa8...",
        "6. Nxf7": "here we go: Fischer used to call this the 'Fried Liver Attack'; never figured out why, but it must have to do with the Black Kings' constitution...",
        "6... Kxf7": "of course forced...",
        "7. Qf3+": "and here we are: Black is faced with a hanging Knight on d5, while in check; of course, there is only one option: cover Nd5, while running out of check...",
        "7... Ke6 8. d4": "of course, after Nbc3, Nce7, d4, Black is not enjoying a picknick, but this speeds it up a bit: Fischers' recommendation...",
        "8... Nxd4": "of course, exd4, Qe4+ is hardly an option: that would lose Nd5...",
        "9. Qe4": "also covering for pawn c2: very useful...",
        "9... c6": "not the best, considering White's plans: maybe better Bd6...",
        "10. f4": "another blow: this time, pawn e5 is on the menu...",
        "10... Bd6": "this time, this is forced: but there is a problem...",
        "11. f5+": "and here it is...",
        "11... Kd7": "the only one, to prevent more trouble...",
        "12. c3": "first, we need to chase away Nd4, to release the pressure on c2...",
        "12... Nb5 13. Bxd5 cxd5 14. Qxd5": "and again, Black is in trouble: Nc7 is met with Qf7+, but also after a6, Qf7+, the Black King is in a too tight spot...",
        "14... Nc7 15. Qf7+ Qe7": "the only way...",
        "16. Qxe7+": "time to simplify matters...",
        "16... Bxe7 17. O-O": "White is a piece down, for a pawn: but Blacks' position is totally in ruins...",
        "17... Nd5": "Black needs to provide space for the King and Bc8: this prevents Rd1+, but Black has to be very careful...",
        "18. Rd1 Kc6": "needs to get out of the pin: c4 is lethal...",
        "19. g4": "keeping track, of the little ones...",
        "19... b6": "still untangling the position...",
        "20. c4": "time to displace the Knight...",
        "20... Nf6": "a logical reply...",
        "21. h3 Bb7": "connecting the rooks, and finishing development...",
        "22. Nc3": "development and caution against Rd8...",
        "22... Kc7": "understandably, but again incautious...",
        "23. g5 Nh5 24. h4": "White is using up, every useful tempo he has: we are still a piece behind...",
        "24... Rhd8 25. Be3 Rxd1+ 26. Rxd1": "Black is trading pieces, while ahead...",
        "26... Rd8 27. Nd5+ Bxd5 28. cxd5": "at this point, Black gets lost for tempo...",
        "28... g6 29. f6 Bc5": "searching for play: this is not helpful...",
        "30. Rc1": "oops...",
        "30... Kd6": "Black needs to get out of the pin: c4 is lethal...",
        "31. Bxc5+": "first avoid Bxe3, with a nasty check...",
        "31... bxc5 32. f7": "then, stir up new trouble...",
        "32... Ke7": "not the best decision probably: Black is releasing the pressure too soon...",
        "33. Rxc5": "of course...",
        "33... Kxf7": "better safe than sorry: but Rd7 was more accurate...",
        "34. Rc7+ Kg8": "practically forced...",
        "35. Rc5": "White needs to be patient here: after Rxa7, Rxd5, the chances are turning to Blacks' favour...",
        "35... Rb8": "trying to squirm a way out...",
        "36. b3 Nf4 37. d6": "ruthless...",
        "37... Nd3": "covering for pawn e5...",
        "38. Rc7": "again, ruthless...",
        "38... e4": "this pawn isn't going anywhere, but Black will need Ne5 very soon: after d7, followed by Rc8, Black is losing...",
        "39. Rxa7": "pick a pawn, while we are ahead...",
        "39... Rd8 40. d7 Ne5 41. a4": "investing in the future...",
        "41... Nxd7 42. b4": "locking up Nc5...",
        "42... e3": "a useless effort, but Black is running out of moves...",
        "43. Kf1 e2+": "at least giving Black one tempo, to reorganize...",
        "44. Kxe2 Re8+ 45. Kd3": "and that was the tempo...",
        "45... Ne5+": "White has to be very careful here: Nf3 is in the air...",
        "46. Ke4": "avoiding Nf3...",
        "46... Nc4+ 47. Kd5": "always attack an attacking Knight: a loose Knight is no match for a King...",
        "47... Ne5": "forced into safety: but White is getting too close for comfort...",
        "48. b5": "Re8 is occupied, so we invest in promotion...",
        "48... Nf3": "looking for counterplay: but it might be too late...",
        "49. Rd7": "against Rd8+...",
        "49... Nxh4 50. b6": "losing no time...",
        "50... Rf8": "looking for a chance to get to the King...",
        "51. Re7": "after Rf5+, Re5...",
        "51... Ra8": "another try...",
        "52. b7": "ruthless...",
        "52... Ra5+": "after a direct Rxa4, of course b8=R+ and mate: Black needs to buy time...",
        "53. Kc6 Rf5": "now, upon b8 and promotion, Black has Rf8...",
        "54. Re8+": "but White shows no mercy: again, Black is faced with a do or die situation...",
        "54... Rf8": "Kg6 or Kg7 are virtually no options: Black will have to run for it...",
        "55. b8=Q Rxe8": "all or nothing...",
        "56. Qxe8+ Kg7 57. Kd6": "I decided, to take the prosaic approach: bleed Black of all the useful moves: Black has to react, before mate is a fact...",
        "57... Nf5+ 58. Ke5": "after a greedy Ke6, follows Nd4+ and probably some other nuisances which might possibly lead to stalemate: this keeps the Knight away...",
        "58... Nd6": "a desperado attempt: after Kxd6, Black reaches stalemate...",
        "59. Qe7+": "but not today: first we drive the KIng away...",
        "59... Kg8": "forced: after Kh8, Qf8 mates...",
        "60. Kxd6": "like this: after the forced Kh8, Qf8 mates; so Black resigned..."
