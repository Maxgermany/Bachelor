        "1. e4": "I start conventionally",
        "1... e5": "He replies with the same",
        "2. Nf3": "The most commonly played move",
        "2... Nc6": "And so is this",
        "3. Bc4": "I opt for the Giuoco Piano, meaning \"Quiet Game\" in Italian. In some countries this is known as the Italian Game.",
        "3... Bc5": "and he responds with the main line",
        "4. c3": "I threaten d4",
        "4... Nf6": "This is his best move",
        "5. d3": "I play this rather than try for an immediate advantage with d4. After 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Black can play Bb4+ with a reasonable game. So instead I play a version of the Giuoco Pianissimo, \"Very quiet Game\", going for a slow build-up, castling first and maybe playing d4 when I am better develped. Black has played well so far.",
        "5... O-O": "So he castles",
        "6. O-O": "So do I",
        "6... d6": "He opens a diagonal for his bishop.",
        "7. Nbd2": "I develop my knight",
        "7... Be6": "He develops his bishop",
        "8. b4": "I hit his bishop",
        "8... Bb6": "It drops back",
        "9. a4": "I gain space on the queen side. The position is virtually level. Both a5 and a6 are perfectly playable for black. Bxc4 may be OK too. Instead he seems to miss my threat, and also makes another mistake, that of moving a piece twice in the opening, for no good reason.",
        "9... Bg4": "This makes no sense. If he wanted to put his bishop on this square why not do so on move 7?",
        "10. a5": "Winning bishop for pawn",
        "10... Bxf3": "He takes",
        "11. Nxf3": "I take back",
        "11... Bxf2+": "He takes my f pawn.",
        "12. Rxf2": "I take his bishop",
        "12... a6": "I'm not sure of the point of this move. b5 wasnot threatened",
        "13. Bg5": "Finally developing my bishop to a dangerous square for him",
        "13... Qd7": "So he gets out of the pin",
        "14. Bxf6": "I take his knight, ruining his pawn formation",
        "14... gxf6": "He takes back",
        "15. Nh4": "Heading for the powerful f5 square, from which it cannot be driven away by a pawn.",
        "15... Ne7": "So his knight comes over to defend the square",
        "16. Nf5": "My knight hops in. As I am material up, I don't mind exchanges, besides, my rook is going to settle on that square instead.",
        "16... Nxf5": "So he takes",
        "17. Rxf5": "I take back. f6 is very weak now. He cannot really save it, for instance if he tries to protect f6 with Kg7 and Qe7 I have Qf3 and Ra1-f1 piling up on it. Post-match computer analysis gives Kh8 and Rg8 as Black's best plan, but it is already very hard for him.",
        "17... Rfe8": "Not sure what his plan is with this move.",
        "18. Rxf6": "So I take",
        "18... Re7": "He protects f7 again.",
        "19. Qh5": "I attack it again. Ra1-f1 is coming soon. Although he can protect f7 enough times, I can follow up with Rf1-f3-h3 and then h7 falls. He is lost.",
        "19... Kf8": "A blunder in a lost position. Post-match analysis showed the only way to fight on was with Re7-e6 to blunt my bishop c4, but it is still pretty dreadful",
        "20. Qxh7": "So I take and threaten Qh8 mate.",
        "20... Qg4": "He finds a defence - for now.",
        "21. Rxf7+": "I take another pawn, and he can't take my rook as I take back with the queen with mate. Some may resign here, but my friend is no quitter and bravely plays on to the end.",
        "21... Ke8": "This is the only other move.",
        "22. Rxe7+": "So I take his rook. Now Kf8 allows Qf7 mate, so his only other move is...",
        "22... Kd8 23. Rf1": "Finally mobilising my last piece and threatening Rf1-f8 mate. ",
        "23... Qf4": "So he blocks that. I could simply take his queen now, but I had another finish in mind.",
        "24. Rd7+": "I check. If he had played Kc8, I would have continued with Rc7 check and eventually he has to move his king towards my queen, allowing a similar mate to the game.",
        "24... Ke8": "But he came back this way immediately",
        "25. Qe7#": "So I finished him off. Many thanks for reading this, please rate my annotation and give a comment or two to let me know how I am doing with my annotations. Until next time, dear reader."
