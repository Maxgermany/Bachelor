        "1. e4": "This was a first try for me with the Traxler counter attack. This is definitely a risky 'all or nothing' opening for black, but one gives a lively and enjoyable alternative to quieter and more strategic openings.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6": "So far, a traditional two Knights defence.",
        "4. Ng5": "The White knight moves takes up a threatening position.",
        "4... Bc5": "Black ignores the threat and sets up an attack of his own.",
        "5. Nxf7": "White takes the available material and forks queen and rook.",
        "5... Bxf2+": "Black lights the fuse, with the signature traxler BXf2. From here on in, it's fireworks all the way.\n",
        "6. Kf1": "White makes the best move available. (If 6 KXB, then nxe4 gets tricky for white.)",
        "6... Qe7": "The White queen moves to safety.",
        "7. Nxh8": "The hungry knight continues to chew up the available material.",
        "7... d5": "Black keeps the counter attack going. Threatening the White bishop and opening up the channel for the LSB.",
        "8. exd5": "White eliminates the threat and is now offering his own threat to the knight on c3.",
        "8... Nd4": "Time to throw the knight into the attack.",
        "9. d6": "The pawn advances, threatening the black queen and reopening the diagonal for the llsb, and the escape route for his knight on f7.",
        "9... cxd6": "Pxd6 - a necessary pause in the attack.",
        "10. Kxf2": "And now white feels able to take the bishop that has been hanging onf2 since move 5",
        "10... Ne4+": "So I throw a second knight into the fray. Any loss of momentum and Black will be overwhelmed by white's huge material advantage.",
        "11. Kg1": "The king retreats..\n",
        "11... Qg5": "i feel like I have lost my position, and can see no real way of continuing the attack. So I try one last throw of the dice.",
        "12. d3": "This looks like a natural move for white, opening up the diagonal to develop the bishop, whilst simultaneously attacking the black queens and knight.\n\nBut after black's next move white's goose is well and truly cooked......",
        "12... Ne2+": "If the king tries to run for it the black queen will check on f5 and mate will follow on f2. So instead......",
        "13. Qxe2": "White kills the knight",
        "13... Qxc1+": "And it's all over.....white can of course block on f1, but after 14.....qg3+ 15 Qf2 QxF2 #\n\nA lucky win for black, after some inaccurate play but fun all the same!"
