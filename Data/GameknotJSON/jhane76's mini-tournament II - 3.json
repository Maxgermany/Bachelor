        "1. e4": "Who's A Lucky Panda!?\n\nThis one I over-reached myself. Got too ambitious and nearly paid the price, tried to salvage a draw with perpetual and somehow walked away with the win. Very lucky!",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5": "I LIKE this opening. I really should learn some others, but the saying about old dogs and new tricks is very true....",
        "4. Nc3 Nf6 5. d3 h6 6. a3 O-O 7. b4 Bd4 8. Bb2 d6 9. Nxd4 Nxd4 10. Ne2 Bg4": "So far so good, about equal in dev terms I think, no overt threats and feeling optimistic....",
        "11. f3 Nxe2 12. Qxe2 Bd7 13. O-O b5 14. Bd5 Nxd5 15. exd5 c6": "Started to worry here, could see him having a lot more attacking potential and/or my pawns getting bent out of shape so....",
        "16. c4 bxc4 17. dxc4": "Not very satisfactory as I'm liable to end up with an isolated d pawn.",
        "17... f5 18. Rad1 f4 19. Qd2 Qg5 20. dxc6 Bxc6 21. Qxd6": "Pawn snaffling time. Always snaffle pawns. Well I shouldn't really, but they are tasty.",
        "21... Ba4 22. Rd5 Rfd8": "And this is where it started to go slightly askew. Looking at the e5 pawn I quite forgot that my opponent is equally entitled to attack me. Which I don't think is fair but unfortunately I don't get to make the rules.",
        "23. Qe6+ Kh8 24. Bxe5": "So I thought I'd be a smart aleck and attack the g7 pawn exposing the queen to the rook. Great idea yeah?",
        "24... Rde8 25. Bxg7+ Qxg7": "No it wasn't a great idea. Cos the queen just takes the bishop. You know if I had brains I'd be dangerous.",
        "26. Qa6 Re2 27. Rf2": "Block and protect. Rook doing a valiant job of bodyguarding the lowly but rather important g pawn.",
        "27... Qa1+": "And right about HERE is where I start to imitate Rincewind the Wizard.",
        "28. Rf1 Qxa3": "If I were my opponent I might have tried R-e1 there",
        "29. Qf6+": "But I'm going for perpetual check. I'm a big cowardly custard and I've had enough of this..",
        "29... Kg8 30. Qg6+ Kf8 31. Qxh6+ Kg8 32. Rg5+ Kf7 33. Qg7+ Ke6 34. Rg6+ Kf5 35. Qf6#": "Ah, ok.... tbh I didn't even see it myself (wasn't thinking about the f3 pawn at all see, was just trying to make a nuisance of myself). The game disappeared and I panicked. And then a smile of disbelief probably echoed by curses from my opponent.\n\nPlans? Who needs plans. Sometimes sheer undiluted panic DOES work."
