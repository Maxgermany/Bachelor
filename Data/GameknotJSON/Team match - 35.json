        "1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. e3 Nb4 4. Bb5+ c6 5. Be2 Bf5 6. e4": "Bd3 doesn't waste the pawn, though black likely trades knight for bishop.\n",
        "6... dxe4 7. a3": "This is a good move.  The threat is black plays e3 and white has no new defense against Nxc2+.  The fork must be defended against, and pushing the knight does that.\n",
        "7... Na6": "Black is probably better off with Nd5.  If I were white I would play BxNa6 and double black's pawns.",
        "8. f3 e3": "This pawn is lost, and black moved it three times.  Better to have taken something for it, like exf3, or bolster its defense with Nf6.\n",
        "9. Bxe3 Nf6 10. Bc4 b5 11. Be2": "White has moved the bishop to e2 twice.  Each time black moves a pawn, developing position.  Free moves for black.\n",
        "11... e6 12. Bf4 Nh5 13. g3": "White is better off playing Bb3, even though it moves the bishop again, because black's best move appear to be trading knight for bishop and doubling white's pawns.",
        "13... g5 14. Be5 f6": "With a bishop move white once again (third time) encourages black to move a pawn.  White's black bishop now has nowhere to run."
