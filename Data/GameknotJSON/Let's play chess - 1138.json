        "1. e4": "reasonable choice involving many tactics unlike queen pawn games which invlove positional play which isn't one of my strenghths",
        "1... c5": "sicilian; sharp counter attacking defense to e4, one of my favorite defenses I am very familier with",
        "2. Nf3": "preparing d4, cxd4, Nxd4",
        "2... e6": "2....e6 sicilian",

        "6. Bd2": "unpin",
        "6... Qc7": "actively placing the queen and maintaining a little pressure on c3",
        "7. Qg4": "exploiting the weak g7 square",
        "7... g6": "was forced; f8 would have lost tempi; also note that this has caused a kingsde weakness and a hole on f6 which was the ideal place for a knight which can be easily attacked",
        "8. Rd1": "placing my rook on a file that im eventually going to try to open and on which the rook might prove a handy tool for discovered attacks",

        "10. Qxf6 Qe5": "forcing exchange of queens; note exchanging simplifying the position when down in material leads to a losing endgame; you should never try to exchange when down in material; white happliy accepted queen trade",
        "11. Qxe5 Nxe5 12. Na4": "when you have a material advantage always try to exchange and simlify into a winning endgame",
        "12... Bxd2+ 13. Rxd2 O-O": "I think castling at this point is ineffective since the middle game is coming to an end; more effective would have been Ke7 trying to bring king into play",

        "14... Ng4 15. Be2": "gaining yet more tempi while opening lines for my bishop on the kingside",

        "18. Nb6": "this preserves my piece proving the fork useless",
        "18... Rb8 19. Nxc8": "like i said, simplifying position to head for the endgame",
        "19... bxc4": "regaining lost bishop while attacking b2; although i think taking the knight would have been more effective since it stops it from inhabiting the hole on d6 and by gaining tempi since the bishop would have been still attacked and it would have caused it to move makng the c file semi open",

        "23. Rb7": "attacking black's weak kingside pawn structure by placing rook on seventh rank",
        "23... a4": "desperation; also note that a3 is restricted by the knight on c4 minimizing rook movement; from this position you can see the beauty of the knight awesome power when well placed",
        "24. Rxd7": "snatches pawn",
        "24... Ra8": "I don't understand the point of this move instead i think that black should have gone for kingside expansion and should have given up hope on queening at a1",
        "25. Ne5": "attacking f7; note that Nd6 would have blocked the soon to be opened d file",

        "27... Kh8": "At this point I saw a brilliant mate in 5 exploiting weak kingside and the open files; also note that 27  Nxe6 opened the d file!",
