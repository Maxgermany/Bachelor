Qe2 Nxc3 12. bxc3 Qc8": "Black's position has a few targets (g7,h6 and h7) since all of these are on the kingside, a kingside attack is clearly the most logical continuation. The weakness on the b1-h7 diagonal suggests a queen & bishop battery (with the obvious mate threat on h7), but a sacrifice on h6 could also be possible. Whilst White has time since counterattack is a long way away for Black, Black does threat 13...Ba6 to rid White of his strongest piece. This would still be playable e.g. 13.a4 Ba6 14.Bxa6 Qxa6 15.Qxa6 Nxa6 16.a5... With a favourable - if slight - position for White. Nonetheless, White should aim for more in a dominant position such as this....",
