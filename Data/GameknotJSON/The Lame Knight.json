        "1. e4": "White starts out with the very solid 1. e4.",

        "2. e5 Nd5 3. d4": "Taking even more central territory. White's advantage right now is decisive.",
        "3... c6 4. c4": "Taking even more territory. Black's knight is feeling heavy pressure, and is nothing but a liability for Black at this point.",
