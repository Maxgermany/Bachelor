        "2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Bc4 e6": "Fischer style... after Ne7 and 0-0, d5 takes the initiative... but there are risks involved here, like Nb5/Nd6+... we hope for d4, cxd4...",
        "5. d3": "these are the kind of breaks, black is looking for... already, black had the advantage of d5, exd5, exd5, Bb3, and Nc6 or whatever... black is gaining the initiative here; best for white was d4, cxd4, etcetera... now after Ne7 and d5, black is better...",

        "21... Nd4 22. Qb1": "there was not much to save here, for white anymore... even after Qxc8, Bxc8, Nxd4, Qxe4+, Ne2, things are looking very bad... but this move takes too much out of whites' defenses...",
        "22... Qh1": "hidden mate themes like this, are once in a lifetime... by sacrificing the Queen, black makes way for Nf3 with checkmate... the only way to escape mate, is Qd3, Nf3+, Qxf3, Qxf3, and losing his own Queen... after Nxd4, Qxg1+, Ke2, Qf1+, Ke3 (Kf3, Bg2+, Ke3 or mate), exd4+... \n\nso white resigned..."
