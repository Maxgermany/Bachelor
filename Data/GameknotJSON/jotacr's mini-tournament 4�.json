    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "The story of this game: Black recovers from some opening mistakes, holding a difficult defensive position for a while. White tries a sacrifice to break black's defenses, and black manages to make the material advantage from the sacrifice count in his favor rather than white's.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 e5": "This takes us a bit off the beaten path, but still with well-known popular responses for white. White will turn the move into an attack.",
        "5. Nb5": "This sets up the threat of Nd6  Bxd6 Qxd6. Black, however, is completely unaware of the hole.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Nb1c3 a6": "A poor idea. d6 is much better here.",
        "7. Nd6+ Bxd6 8. Qxd6 Qe7 9. Qxe7+ Nxe7": "When the dust settles, white has an extra bishop, black an extra knight, and black is arguably a bit more developed.",
        "10. Bg5 d6": "Black is probably better off with b5 followed by Bb7.",
        "11. Bxf6": "! Good positional exchange that will eventually lead to winning a pawn.",
        "11... gxf6 12. O-O-O": "Another excellent attacking move. At first glance, it seems as though black's center is about to collapse.",
        "12... Kd7": "This decision to keep the king centralized has far-reaching strategic implications. It's safer than usual because the queens and 2 minor pieces have already been exchanged away. From here on out, exchanges benefit black, precisely because they make the centralized king more of a help and less of a problem.\n\nThe alternative is to lose the d pawn and any pretense of central control.",
        "13. Bc4": "Targeting the doubled pawns makes perfect sense here.",
        "13... Rf8": "This is black's only possible defense. The only other piece in a position to defend is the king, but that's tied down by the attack on d6.",
        "14. Rd2": "Threatening Rd1 and a quick ending on d6. Black has to clear c8 without losing tempo.",
        "14... b5": "Black has the tempo-gaining move set up. If the bishop goes to b3, black follows up with b4, removing the knight, then plays Bb7 to threaten white's center, and finally plays Nc8 to save the d6 pawn.",
        "15. Bxb5+": "The best continuation available for both sides here appears to be 15. ... axb5 16. Nxb5 Kc6 (if not, 17. Rxd6  Ke8 18. Nc7#) 17. Rxd6  Kxb5.",
        "15... axb5 16. Kb1": "Guarding a2 after the knight grabs the b5 pawn. This was not in fact correct play: white would have done better to press the attack.",
        "16... Ba6": "The bishop is finally activated. The king cannot act as the defender of the b5 pawn without conceding d6.",
        "17. Rhd1 Nc8": "Black's knight gets to where it needs to be just in time.",
        "18. Nd5 Rh8": "The f6 pawn cannot be defended. Ke6 is met by Nc7  and the loss of a rook.",
        "19. Nxf6+ Ke6 20. Nd5 Ra7 21. g3": "Preparations for a push on f4. White is doing everything possible to break up black's center.",
        "21... h5 22. f4 f5": "! 22. ... exf4 would break the black center with disastrous consequences for black. At least with this exchange black destroys white's center as well.",
        "23. exf5+ Kxf5 24. Ne3+": "This maintains the threat to d6, rather than letting black set up the endgame.",
        "24... Ke6 25. fxe5 dxe5": "This leaves black with a passed central pawn that will eventually win the game. Also, the white knight now only has one attacking move available, namely d5.",
        "26. Rd2d5 Re7": "Standard play here: By putting a rook behind the passed pawn we make it easier to promote.",
        "27. c3 Rf8": "Threatening to push back the knight with Rf3. This also eliminates the possibility of Nf5.",
        "28. Re1 Nb6": "Because the rooks are no longer combined, the d5 rook becomes a prime target.",
        "29. Rc5 Kd6": "This closes a trap: The c5 rook cannot move without being captured. Also noteworthy here is that now the white knight cannot attack at all: if 30. Nd5 Nxd5 31. Rxd5 Kxd5.",
        "30. b4": "This allows compensation for the rook. Na4 or Nd7 will not win due to the threat on d5.",
        "30... Rc8 31. Rxc8 Bxc8": "If 31. ... Nxc8 32. Nf5  and black is lost.",
        "32. Rd1+ Ke6 33. g4 Kf6": "Not 33. ... hxg4 34. Nxg4 letting the knight out of its contained area. The king must move in order to catch the white pawn in time.",
        "34. Rd6+": "This looks like it wins the black knight, but it doesn't work.",
        "34... Re6 35. Rxe6+": "Possibly better was Rd8 followed by Rh8 to create an opening on black's flank, but white wants the initiative.",
        "35... Bxe6": "Classic bishop-vs-knight positioning: Now the knight cannot advance without falling prey to the bishop. Note how the exchanges are continuing to benefit black due to his active king.",
        "36. gxh5 Kg5 37. a3": "A sheer waste of time.",
        "37... Kxh5 38. Kc2": "White's king finally moves to join the fray. Until this move, black had 2 extra effective pieces: the bishop and the king.",
        "38... Nc4": "Exchanges continue to benefit black. White must trade or lose the a3 pawn.",
        "39. Nxc4 Bxc4": "bxc4 is out of the question: it leaves black tied up trying to stop a pair of passed pawns.",
        "40. Kd2 e4 41. Ke3": "Standard defense: if there's a passed pawn, blockade it.",
        "41... Bd3": "The bishop here is not expected to hold on forever. Its purpose is to hang on long enough for the king to stop the h2 pawn and move to defend the e pawn.",
        "42. Kd4 Kg4 43. c4": "Other moves lose immediately. If white moves his king away from e4 and d3, the e pawn promotes. If a4, bxa4 and one of black's pawns promotes.",
        "43... bxc4 44. b5 c3": "Either the c pawn promotes first, or black buys himself enough time to stop the pawns without losing his e pawn.\n\nBetter for white here would probably be to let the c-pawn promote.",
        "45. Kxc3 Bxb5 46. Kd4 Kf3": "Black no longer needs the king to protect against the h pawn, because the bishop can do that.",
        "47. h4 Be8": "The bishop has enough time to stop both pawns because of how far back they start in white's position. Had either pawn been a step ahead of their current positions, black would be forced to concede a draw.",
        "48. a4 Bxa4 49. h5 Be8 50. h6 Bg6 51. Ke5 e3": "White is now unable to force the bishop off the h7-b1 diagonal. h7 is now met by Bxh7, whether or not the white king will recapture.",
        "52. Kf6 Bb1": ""
