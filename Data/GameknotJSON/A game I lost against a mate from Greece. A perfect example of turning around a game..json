        "2... b6": "and I follow with a stupid (soon to be proven) move",
        "3. Nxe5": "what I expected...",
        "3... f6": "just about the only good thing that the pawns can be used for, except for resurrecting captured pieces",
        "4. Nf3": "he moves back...",
        "4... Nh6": "also move my knight... could have chosen better moves, but felt the need to get the knight out of hiding",
        "5. Bc4": "no idea why he moved his bishop there...",
        "5... c6": "another hopeless move by me",
        "6. d4": "this move exposed my knight, though the g7 pawn is defending it",
        "6... Ba6": "I insist on swapping bishops... a little fight that in the end I win... you'll see",
        "7. Bxa6": "the predicted move, and......",
        "7... Nxa6": "I win the 'quarrel...'. I often think whether or not I should get myself into that 'argument,' as bishops are worth more than knights, but how else do I get one of his good pieces near the beginning of the game?",
        "8. Nc3": "a response with a knight...",
        "8... f5": "completely hopeless, superfluous move... of course, made by me...",
        "9. e5": "an excellent responding move...",
        "9... Bb4": "a good move I finally saw I could do...",
        "10. Bg5": "a response full of intimidation... I would take the life of his bishop if his f3 knight wasn't in the way...",
        "10... Qc7": "the only reasonable move to do, really...",
        "11. Qd3": "another forceful move aimed at taking my knight obviously",
        "11... Bxc3+": "a pathetic move, just to try and get him to move his queen...",
        "12. bxc3": "though I'm proven wrong...",
        "12... b5": "in complete dismay, I decide to use a pawn, again, for defense...",
        "13. c4": "well thought out move mate!",
        "13... Nb4": "I see a chance here, so move my knight, in it's valour, to change the game around...",
        "14. Qa3": "not so good a move, but exactly fits in with my plan...",
        "14... Nxc2+": "double trouble for mario... a win for me... haha!",
        "15. Kd2": "his superiority doesn't look as though it will hold much longer, so....",
        "15... Nxa3": "A nice plan, that was...",
        "16. Rae1": "After losing his Queen, he must start the game next to all over again...",
        "16... Qa5+": "I decide to put him in Check...",
        "17. Kd1": "Hhmmm... what move next?",
        "17... bxc4": "may as well take one of his pawns...",
        "18. e6": "very well thought-out move",
        "18... c3": "but I decide to not move, so move to the other side of the board again...",
        "19. exd7+": "Oohhh... excellent move by mariodag... I can't castle now...",
        "19... Kxd7": "Ah well, not much I can do about it, so I take his pawn...",
        "20. Re7+": "Oh no... it seems he's up to something...",
        "20... Kd6": "I'd better move....",
        "21. Rhe1": "Ah oh... trouble?",
        "21... c2+": "I decide to put him in Check... just to get him back...",
        "22. Kc1": "the only move he can make...",
        "22... Rab8": "I have to use that castle for something...",
        "23. Re1e6+": "Once again, a marvellous check made by mario...",
        "23... Kd5": "I have less places to move...",
        "24. Re6e5+": "good move...",
        "24... Kc4": "the only place I could really move...",
        "25. Rxa5": "Wow.... it seems that mario's beginning to turn the game around....",
        "25... Kc3": "one of the only places left to move to, but good move at that...",
        "26. Rxa3+": "or so I thought.... what's happening?",
        "26... Kc4": "There goes my game... turned around from my advantage to his advantage...",
        "27. Kxc2": "Just knew he'd take that... one of my last hopes...",
        "27... Rb4": "I have to do my best, so start off with getting my castle out...",
        "28. Rc3+": "Oh no...",
        "28... Kb5": "This game looks a bit risky...",
        "29. Rc5+": "Oh please... this shows there's no mercy in Chess, haha!",
        "29... Kb6": "I have to watch where I'm moving...",
        "30. Kc3": "that doesn't look very good...",
        "30... a5": "I have to bring in my pawn to defend my castle...",
        "31. Re6": "Ah oh... excellent move by mariodag...",
        "31... Rc8": "I have defense though, using another castle...",
        "32. Ne5": "Ah oh... I can see where this is leading to...",
        "32... Ng8": "I have to use my knight for something...",
        "33. Be3": "well, I wasn't really thinking that mariodag would move his bishop to e3...",
        "33... Nf6": "To tell the truth, it helped me pick out where to move my knight...",
        "34. Nc4+": "Ah oh... more trouble...",
        "34... Ka6": "the game is focusing around that side and section of the board...",
        "35. Rxa5+": "excellent move by mariodag...",
        "35... Kb7": "one of the last places I can move...",
        "36. Kxb4": "Ah well, my castle put up a good fight.. haha.",
        "36... Ng4": "hhmmm... a nice selection of pieces to take, though it won't really change the game.. haha.",
        "37. Re7+": "oh bother... my selection of places to move my King are becoming shorter...",
        "37... Rc7": "so I'll make that move...",
        "38. Nd6+": "Ah oh... a mixture of good pieces like that means a lose for me, for sure...",
        "38... Kb6": "I decide to play around a bit...",
        "39. d5+": "Hhmmm... seems nothing wrong with that move, except that it put me in check...",
        "39... c5+": "I decide to 'fight back' lightly with a check of my own...",
        "40. Bxc5+": "another check... very well thought out move...",
        "40... Rxc5": "but I do a stupid move to get rid of that annoying bishop...",
        "41. Rxc5": "and mariodag takes my castle with no worry of getting taken...",
        "41... f4": "I decide to move one of my last pawns to f4...",
        "42. Rb7+": "so, now, where do I move? I can see it coming to an end..",
        "42... Ka6": "Yes... a definite end...",
        "43. Ra5#": "and there you have it... An excellent game, turned from my advantage to mario's advantage... please feel free to comment- :)"
