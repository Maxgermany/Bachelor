        "3... Be7 4. Bb5 Nc6 5. Qc3": "BxNc6 is also decent.  Here NxPe4 threatens the white queen, but it would be a bad move because QxPg7 then gives white a couple of pawns.",
        "5... O-O 6. e5 Nd5 7. Qc4 Nb6 8. Qg4 Nxe5 9. Qe4 d6 10. Bd3 f5 11. Qf4 g5 12. Qb4": "The problem with bringing out the queen is that she gets chased.  Notice here white has moved the queen 8 times, but has only two pieces in the field.  Black has advanced three pawns and three other pieces.",
        "12... c5 13. Qb3+ d5 14. Bb5 a6 15. Be2 c4 16. Qg3 f4 17. Qc3 d4 18. Qa5 d3 19. Qxe5 dxe2 20. b3": "Oh, really terrible idea.  QxPe2 seems better.  With this move black plays Bf6 pinning the queen against the rook at a1.",
        "20... Bf6": "Yes, just like that.",
        "21. Qe4 Bxa1 22. c3 Bf5 23. Qxe2": "Ok, now taking the pawn is a terrible idea, because the king and queen are lined up beautifully for a rook pin, such as Re8.",
        "23... Re8": "Yes, again just like that.",
        "24. Na3 Rxe2+ 25. Kxe2": "Oops, NxRe2 would have been enormously better, helping free up the h rook.  This move leads to mate in two.",
