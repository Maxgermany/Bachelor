        "1. d4 e5": "Englund Gambit.  I have not played against this before.  According to Wikipedia, the idea is for Black to move into a tactical game and away from the closed d4 openings.  I thought the game definitely had more of an e4 character, so I think it succeeded at that.",
        "2. dxe5 d6 3. exd6 Bxd6": "Black is down a pawn, but has an extra tempo to compensate.",
        "4. Nf3 Nf6 5. Nc3 c6": "I think maybe Bd7 or a6 was better here if the goal is to keep White's N off b5.  c6 takes away a good square for the N.",
        "6. e4 O-O": "Black puts the extra tempo to good use here.",
        "7. Bd3 Re8 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3 Bh5 10. Be3": "I'm not sure if this is the best square for the B.  g5 may be a better option.",
        "10... h6 11. Re1 Qe7 12. Bd4 Bc7 13. Bxf6": "This is definitely not smart.  It gives Black too much pressure of f3.",
        "13... Qxf6 14. g4 Bxg4 15. hxg4 Qf4": "Black sacrifices the B to open White's K.  White needs to get reinforcements to the Kingside as quickly as possible.",
        "16. Bf1 Na6": "This awkward development is required because c6 is blocked.  ",
        "17. Bg2 Nc5 18. Qd2 Qxg4 19. Qe3 Bf4": "I think this was an oversight.  Black was thinking about his attack and didn't notice his N was hanging.",
        "20. Qxc5 Re6 21. Qf5": "This forces the exchange of Qs.  If White can defuse the Kingside attack, the position should be won easily.",
        "21... Rg6 22. Qxg4 Rxg4 23. Ne2 Re8 24. Nxf4 Rxf4": "Black is down to two Rs.",
        "25. Rad1 Re6": "Black avoids Rxe4.  It will lead to further exchanges and a loss of material after 25...Rxe4  26. Rxe4 Rxe4  27. Rd8+ Kh7  28. Ng5+ hxg5  29. Bxe4.",
        "26. e5 Rg6 27. Rd6": "Threatening the exchange of Rs.",
        "27... Rxf3 28. Rxg6 fxg6 29. Bxf3": "White's material advantage is now decisive.",
        "29... g5 30. e6 Kf8 31. e7+ Ke8 32. Bh5+": "White's pawn will promote.",
        "32... Kd7": "Black resigned here.  White's biggest problem will be figuring out the most efficient checkmate.  There is no chance to lose this position now."
