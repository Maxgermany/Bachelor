        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. f4": "Instead of Nc3, I decided to advance my pawns.  My aim was to create a strong pawn presence in the center and attack early, as this was meant to be a quick game, hence the game title.",
        "3... Bb4+ 4. Nc3": "The reason for f4 instead of Nc3.  That, and I had recently went over a lot of 19th century games with f4 openings.  I'm a romantic player at heart.",
        "4... Qe7 5. Nf3 b6 6. e3 Bb7 7. Bd3 d5 8. O-O Nbd7 9. Nb5": "With my king in safety and my pieces in the center, I mount my attack.",
        "9... Qd8 10. cxd5": "Clearing the center before the fireworks.",
        "10... Nxd5 11. e4 Nd5f6 12. e5 Nd5 13. a3 Be7 14. f5": "The pawns advance like molten lava.",
        "14... a6": "A weak counter, and the losing move.  exf5 would have led to a more even game.",
        "15. fxe6 fxe6 16. Ng5": "With that pawn exchange, the f file is now cleared.  I was looking for his pawn, but crossed my fingers for a knight sacrifice, which I got.",
        "16... Bxg5 17. Qh5+ g6 18. Bxg6+": "At this point, it took my opponent five days to make his next move because he wanted to finish his other winnable games to make his rating go up.  I've done that many times before.  But he had 30+ games at once.  I don't have a site membership, so I can't play that many.",
        "18... Ke7 19. Bxg5+ Nd5f6 20. exf6+": "Black Resigns.  If he stays on the Kingside, there will be blood."
