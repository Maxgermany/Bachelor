        "1. d4": "martineli was rated 1889 and I wanted to play solidly...it was a blitz game",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3": "i was hoping to transpose into a london system-type setup",
        "2... Bg4": "here i should have played e3 I believe.  instead, i developed the \"london bishop\" which would play a significant role as the game went...",
        "3. Bf4 Bxf3 4. gxf3": "i was thinking bh3 looked very nice",
        "4... e6 5. Nd2": "ideas of the c4 break",
        "5... h6 6. Bh3": "a bad blunder; i was too enamored of how nice the bishop would be parked on h3",
        "6... Nc6": "here again i miss the chance to ward off the nasty qh4",
        "7. c3 Qh4 8. Bxc7": "i figured that since I was going to drop material, i needed some kind of sudden, aggressive attack if i was to have any chance of a sporting game",
        "8... Qxh3 9. Qb3 b6 10. Qb5": "with obvious threats of qxc6",
        "10... Nge7 11. Qa6": "ideas of qb7 or bxb6",
        "11... e5 12. Bxb6": "...perhaps qb7 was stronger",
        "12... Qc8": "down by about a pawn, I am happy to get the queens off.",
        "13. Qxc8+ Nxc8 14. Bc7 exd4 15. cxd4 Nxd4 16. Kd1": "awkward but the only way to defend both e2 and c2",
        "16... Nb5 17. Bf4 Bd6 18. Bxd6": "if bishop e3 then d4",
        "18... Ncxd6 19. Rc1 O-O 20. Rc5": "rc6 may have been stronger",
        "20... d4 21. Rg1 Rac8 22. Rd5": "ideas of a4",
        "22... a6 23. a4 Rfd8": "he thought for a long while prior to this move.  there may have been a better continuation but i was going to be happy to equalize",
        "24. axb5 axb5 25. Rg4 Nc4 26. Rxd8+ Rxd8 27. Nxc4 bxc4": "white has equalized and both sides are even in material in this pawn-and-rook ending.",
        "28. Kc2": "his pawns looked menacing and i wanted to encourage d3+, afterwards picking up the c pawn",
        "28... d3+ 29. exd3 cxd3+ 30. Kd2 g5": "a possible mistake? rb8 looked more threatening...",
        "31. Rb4 Kg7 32. Rb3 Rd4 33. Rxd3 Rh4 34. Ke2": "already the b-pawn is looking like a runner...",
        "34... Rxh2 35. b4 Rh4 36. Rb3 Rc4 37. Kd3 Rc6 38. b5 Rb6 39. Kc4 h5 40. Kc5 Rb8 41. b6 Rc8+ 42. Kd6 h4 43. b7 Rb8 44. Kc7 Rxb7+ 45. Rxb7": "perhaps capturing with my king would have been better.  white is material up in the endgame, but i wasn't sure if i could convert the win (nor was he...)",
        "45... Kg6 46. Kd6 f6 47. Rb1 f5 48. Rg1 Kh5 49. Ke5": "i think this is a strong move.  black is lost",
        "49... f4 50. Kf5": "the final move of the game, threatening rxg5+.  thus concluded my greatest upset victory."
