        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. d4": "Another rundown on the Hungarian variation in the Sicilian; this time we will try to follow the book... at this level, Kindergarten is over...",
        "4... cxd4 5. Nxd4 d6": "we learned from earlier experience, that this is the best way to go after Nc3... my preferred e6, Ne7, 0-0, to prepare d5, will soon fail in the absence of a6... maybe, I should incorporate a6 somewhere in this variation...",
        "6. Bb5+ Bd7 7. O-O Nc6 8. Be3 Nf6 9. Be2 O-O 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Rb1 Qa5 12. a3 Rfd8 13. Qd2 Ng4 14. Bg5": "pretty flawless game from both players up until now, in this closed Sicilian... White however, is giving Black an opportunity that cannot be missed... White had no better than Bxg4, Bxg4, h3, Be6, Bd4, with a slight edge; this Bishop will get very busy in the future, losing lots of tempo...",
        "14... Bxc3 15. bxc3": "after Qxc3, of course Qxg5...",
        "15... Nf6 16. f3": "harsh as it is, this is Whites' best move, eg. Bxf6, exf6, Qd4 (Qxd6??, Bg4), f5, exf5, Bxf5, Bf3, d5; all other options are failing also... Black has taken the initiative, and earned a dangerous advantage on the a-file...",
        "16... Qxa3 17. Rba1 Qc5+ 18. Be3 Qe5 19. Qd4 Qe6 20. c4": "a bad decision: White should have played Rxa7 or Bc4...",
        "20... c5": "with c4 locked against c5, both of Whites' bishops have no real play left; for a very long time, as we will soon learn... this might well be the turning point in this game, favouring Black...",
        "21. Qc3 a6": "the start of a winning march...",
        "22. Rfb1 Bc8 23. Qa5 Re8 24. Qb6 Nd7 25. Qc6 Ra7 26. Qd5": "not the best of choices... better was Rb8!, Nf6 (Nxb8??, Qxe8+ and White is winning), Qb6!, Rd7...",
        "26... Bb7": "this settles all; White has lost all advantages... after Rxb7?, Qxd5, cxd5/exd5, Rxb7, Black is winning...",
        "27. Qd2 Ne5 28. Qc3 Rea8 29. Rb6 Nd7 30. Rb3 a5": "now, the free a-pawn will march...",
        "31. Rab1 Bc6 32. Ra3 a4": "this closes up the b-file for White; all squares from b3 to b8 are in Blacks' control, and both Whites' Bishops are out of play...",
        "33. Bg5 Rb7": "another useless move from this Bishop, while Black is taking over the b-file...",
        "34. Rxb7 Bxb7 35. Ra1": "it is hard for White to find a continuation; this is not one of the best... the only real attack Bh6 - threatens Qg7 mate - is happily countered with Qf6, Qxf6, Nxf6... safest way to go is Qa1/e1, Bc6 - always, or else f6 - Qf1, Qe5, Be3, Rb8, and sit this one out....",
        "35... Bc6": "preparing Ne5 and Rb8... c4 is getting into trouble, alongside e4, and also f6, g5, etcetera is in the air, countering an eventual f4...",
        "36. Bd3": "probably best...",
        "36... Ne5 37. Be2": "tougher was Rb1, to prevent an immediate Rb8... might follow f5, exf5, gxf5, Kf1, a3...",
        "37... Rb8 38. Bh6": "there was nothing to gain in Qa5, Nd7... this move gives an opportunity to force trading Queens, and Black is happy to oblige...",
        "38... Qf6": "forces Bd2, because of Nxf3+, Qxf3 (forced, otherwise Qxc3), Qxa1+; next is Nd7...",
        "39. Bd2": "there are not much options left; Black is also treathening g5...",
        "39... Nd7": "or Qg7, Rd1 (to release the pin over c3), Nd7...",
        "40. Qxf6": "no choice left; trying to win a tempo with any other move will only help Black; options are Qxc3 or Qd4+...",
        "40... Nxf6 41. Bg5": "not the best; Black is gaining tempo...",
        "41... Kg7 42. Kf2 h6 43. Bd2": "not good is Bxf6+, Kxf6, Ke3, Rb2!, Bd1, g5...",
        "43... Nd7 44. Bc3+": "or Bd3, f6, Ke3, e6, Bc3...",
        "44... f6": "lining all pawns up, for the final march... after Kf7, e6, all is ready; we seek to keep the Bishops out of play, unless we can trade one, and march against the White Kings' wing... something has got to give...",
        "45. Ke3 Kf7 46. g3": "better looks h3, e6, g3, Ke7, Bd3; this gives Black an early opportunity to break formation...",
        "46... f5": "swifter than e6, f4, f5...",
        "47. exf5": "better is h4, and wait things out; this will only open up another line for Black... Whites' Ra1 is condemned to guarding the a-pawn...",
        "47... gxf5": "after Bd3, e6...",
        "48. h3": "better was g4, fxg4, fxg4, Nf6!, h3, e6... or Bd3, e6, h3...",
        "48... e5": "no hesitation; Black is gaining tempo fast...",
        "49. Bd3": "or Kf2, Ke6...",
        "49... Kf6": "another inspired tempo, postponing Ke6... better than straightaway Rg8, Be1!...",
        "50. f4": "toughest defense, is g4, f4+, Ke2... this is only helping Black...",
        "50... Rg8": "of course...",
        "51. Kf2": "gradually but surely White is losing control... a better defense is Rg1, h5, Be2, Ke6 (or Nf8, Bxh5, Ne6, Bf3), Bxh5, Nf6, Bf3...",
        "51... Ke6 52. fxe5": "trying to simplify things, but only Black will profit...",
        "52... dxe5 53. Bb2": "trying to release Ra1...",
        "53... h5": "creating a second front of attacks... also possible is e4, Re1, Ne5, Be2, a3! (Bxa3??, e3+, Kxe3, Rxg3+, Kf4, Rxa3), Bc1, h5...",
        "54. Rg1": "not much options left; the White King needs assistance...",
        "54... h4": "the point of no return...",
        "55. gxh4": "not better is g4, fxg4, hxg4, e4, and soon f3...",
        "55... Rxg1": "one defender of a1 down...",
        "56. Kxg1 e4": "no hesitation; we need to keep the White Bishops out of play... also preparing f4; the Black King is guarding Whites' h-pawns via Ke6-Kf7-Kg6... soon, White has to cope with another set of freepawns, and will lose material...",
        "57. Be2": "a bit better is Bf1, Ne5, h5, Nf3+, Kf2...",
        "57... f4": "no mercy...",
        "58. Bg4+": "to avoid f3, no doubt; a bit better was h5, f3, Bf1, e3, Bd3...",
        "58... Kd6": "ready for e3 and an eventual Be4; Bb2 has to stay on guard against Blacks' a-pawn... now, Blacks' new set of free pawns will decide...",
        "59. h5 e3 60. h6 Be4 61. Bxd7": "practically forced... after Bf3!, Bxc2 (Bxf3??, h7), Kg2, Ne5, Bd5, Bh7, White is in even more trouble...",
        "61... Kxd7 62. Ba3": "a bad mistake; White had to play Bc1, Kd6, Kf1, Bxc2, Ke2 (better than h4, Bh7, Ke2), to keep the e-pawn under control while guarding a3... this way, the White Bishop of the black squares will get more squares than he can handle...",
        "62... Bxc2 63. Bxc5": "too late for Bc1, after a3, Bxa3, f3, soon followed by f2...",
        "63... a3": "all the same: Bxa3, f3...",
        "64. Bd4": "what else?",
        "64... a2": "relentless... now after f3, the e-pawn becomes lethal after e2; but also f2+ is losing, due to promotion on f1 after Bd3... and after Bxe3, of course promotion on a1... this game is not far from over for White...",
        "65. h7 Bxh7 66. c5 Kc6 67. Kf1 f3": "in my opinion stronger than Bd3+, Kg2, Be4+, Kg1, f3, or even Kd5, Bc3, f3, etc., because Bxe3 is practically forced... Gameknot's computer analysis however, considered this a blunder: better is Kd5, Bc3, f3, Kg1, f2+, Kg2, Be4+, Kg3, f1Q, Kg4, e2, c6, Qf3+, Kg5, Qxc3, Kg4, a1Q, c7, e1Q; all forced... Black sports a staggering three Queens, and mate follows on move 78; not very surprising... apart from the fact, the actual game variation reaches mate quicker, there is indeed a better way; after Kg4 (better Kh4, e2, Kg4, to win a - useless - tempo), Qf5+, Kh4, e2, Kg3, a1Q, Bxa1, e1B+ (why not a bishop?), Kh2, Qf2, mate is reached 1 move sooner, same as in the actual game...",
        "68. Bxe3 a1=Q+ 69. Kf2 Qh1": "no fussing about, we need to be careful to avoid stalemate; this is the fastest way to mate, after h4, Qg2+, Ke1, Qe2#...",
        "70. Kg3 Qg2+ 71. Kh4": "or Kf4, with the same result...",
        "71... f2": "no mercy...",
        "72. Bxf2": "forced, or else f1Q, and sooner mate; unsportsmanlike as it may seem...",
        "72... Qxf2+": "we now seek for a position with Kh5, Qg3... then mate will follow on Qg6, after h4 or Kh6...",
        "73. Kg4": "after Kh5, Qg3... after Kg5, Qf5+, Kh4 (Kh6, Qg6#), Qf4+, Kh5, Qg3... now Be4 keeps the White King contained; again after Kh5, Qg3, and after h4, Qf3+ (rules out Kh5, made possible thanks to Be4), Kg5, Qf5+, Kh6, Qg6#...",
        "73... Be4 74. Kg5 Qf5+ 75. Kh4 Qf4+ 76. Kh5 Qg3 77. h4 Qg6#": "brought in as predicted... c5 rests as a reminder of things gone terribly wrong..."
