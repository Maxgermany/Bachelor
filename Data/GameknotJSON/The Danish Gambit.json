        "2... exd4 3. c3": "bam! the mighty Danish Gambit!",
        "3... dxc3": "he accepts the first pawn",
        "4. Bc4": "takes a diagonal",
        "4... cxb2": "accepts the second pawn",
        "5. Bxb2": "takes the long diagonal, and now the material advantage is his, but i control most of the board",
        "5... Ne7": "not the best defence here, d5 is actually book, while d5 does give me back a pawn, it opens up blacks pieces very nicely, ne7 leads to an even more cramped position",
        "6. Nf3": "developing, preparing to castle, and bring the rook into play",
        "6... d5": "he now tries to gambit the pawn back to me, after blocking his bishop in, not the best move really, Bg5 was better",
        "7. exd5": "i take the free pawn, but i can't afford to trade the bishop off yet, as im still down a pawn, and owning the diagonals is paramount in the Danish Gambit",
        "7... Nf5": "freeing his bishop",
        "8. O-O": "brings the rook into play",
        "8... Bd6": "starts a kingside push, prepares to castle",
        "9. Re1+": "forces him to retreat either the knight or the bishop and lets me take the pawn on g7",
        "9... Ne7 10. Bxg7": "now material has been equalized and i have a far superior position, note that his king is still in the middle of the board and his queen, bishop, and both knights are stuck",
        "10... Rg8": "tries to drive out the bishop, puts his rook on a file with my king",
        "11. Qd4": "i decide to try to keep the pressure on his struggling king",
        "11... a6": "bit of a waste of time, preparing b5 to drive away my bishop, which needs to move anyway",
        "12. Bd3": "i preempt his move and attack the pawn on h7 which would also win a bishop-rook exchange",
        "12... c5": "he tries to drive out my queen and give his pieces some room",
        "13. Qf6": "i have to guard the bishop and the pressure on his king is mounting",
        "13... Nd7": "this move was intended to move my queen away, but look at his king, completely trapped by his own pieces, and ready to fall",
        "14. Qg5": "keeps the guard on the bishop",
        "14... f6": "can you see the mate?",
        "15. Bg6+": "his pawn move opened up a diagonal to his king, and because his knight is pinned, none of his pieces can defend, all he can defend with is a rook pawn",
        "15... hxg6": "the only move",
        "16. Qxg6#": "game over\r\nhope you enjoyed this one, i think this game really demonstrates the importance of space and development over material\r\nBelacqua17"
