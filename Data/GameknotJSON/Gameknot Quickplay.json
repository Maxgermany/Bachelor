        "1. d4": "I start with my normal.",
        "1... d5": "He replies conventionally.",
        "2. c4": "I opt for the Queen's Gambit.",
        "2... Nf6": "This is inferior, as his knight gets kicked around. Better is e6 or c6.",
        "3. cxd5": "So I take.",
        "3... Nxd5": "He takes back.",
        "4. e4": "I attack the knight, and seize the centre.",
        "4... Nb6": "f6 was a better square, where he attacks the e pawn. ",
        "5. Nc3": "I develop.",
        "5... e6": "So does he.",
        "6. Be3": "Developing the bishop, and also discouraging c7-c5 which attacks my centre.",
        "6... Nc6": "He attacks d4 again.",
        "7. Bd3": "If he takes on d4 now, I take back, and if he recaptures with the queen he loses it to Bb5 check.",
        "7... Bb4": "Another inaccuracy as an exchange on c3 simply strengthens my centre.",
        "8. f4": "I prevent the other pawn break by him - e7-e5.",
        "8... Ne7": "Not sure why he played this?",
        "9. Nf3": "I develop my last minor piece.",
        "9... h6": "Again I think this is rather a waste of a move.",
        "10. O-O": "I castle, bringing my king to safety and my Rh1 into play.",
        "10... a6": "I mirror of h6 perhaps, but again, not helping his development.",
        "11. a3": "Now he is forced to take as Ba5 loses the bishop to b2-b4 and Bd6 to e4-e5",
        "11... Bxc3": "So he takes.",
        "12. bxc3": "I take back.",
        "12... Bd7": "and he finally develops his bishop.",
        "13. a4": "I want to drive back his Nb6. Maybe I can have pressure on the b file by moves like Ra1-b1 attacking b7, after his knight goes.",
        "13... Bc6": "He puts the bishop on a more active square.",
        "14. c4": "With thoughts of d4-d5.",
        "14... Qd7": "Attacking a4, but taking away a square from his bishop.",
        "15. a5": "I hit his knight.",
        "15... Nbc8": "Which runs away.",
        "16. d5": "And now his bishop, which is running out of squares.",
        "16... exd5": "So he takes.",
        "17. exd5": "Normally people are advised to take towards the centre, but it would be a massive mistake to take with the c pawn here, as it would give him b5 for his bishop.",
        "17... Bxd5": "As he is losing it, he may as well get 2 pawns for it.",
        "18. cxd5": "So I take.",
        "18... Nxd5": "he takes back, attacking Be3.",
        "19. Bc5": "I decide to sacrifice a pawn to prevent him castling.",
        "19... Nxf4": "He takes it.",
        "20. Re1+": "I throw in a check.",
        "20... Ne6": "His knight retreats.",
        "21. Nd4": "I put more pressure on his knight.",
        "21... Kd8": "I find this a strange move.",
        "22. Nxe6+": "So I take.",
        "22... fxe6": "He takes back.",
        "23. Rxe6": "I was really pleased to find this! Now if he takes, Bf5 discovers check from my Qd1 and hence wins his queen.",
        "23... Nd6": "So he blocks the d file.",
        "24. Rxd6": "I decide to sacrifice the exchange for a mating attack.",
        "24... cxd6": "He takes the rook.",
        "25. Bb6+": "I throw in a check.",
        "25... Kc8": "The king runs. I have to find a good move, otherwise he may grovel out with Kb8 and Rc8.",
        "26. Bf5": "I sacrifice again, although after the game, checking the ending on Fritz, I found out that Rc1 also wins.",
        "26... Qxf5": "He is almost forced to take.",
        "27. Qxd6": "Threatening mate on c7.",
        "27... Qd7": "Qc2 is a tougher defence, but still loses to Rd1 check, threatening the queen sacrifice Qd8+, mating.",
        "28. Rc1+": "It is over now.",
        "28... Qc6": "Forced.",
        "29. Rxc6+": "So I take.",
        "29... bxc6": "He takes back.",
        "30. Qc7#": "Only to be mated.\n\nMany thanks for reading. Please rate this on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing."
