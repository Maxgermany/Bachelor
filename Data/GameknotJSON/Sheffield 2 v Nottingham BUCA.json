        "1. d4": "I was playing for Sheffield University 2 in the BUCA (British University Chess Association). I can't find out much more about my opponent. He seems to have played in the British Under 18s in 1974. He doesn't seem to be still playing. This BUCA tournament was held in Edinburgh. I think it is the only time I played in it, I think the other years Sheffield University only enter one team, who actually won it a year later in 1977. This is from round 4 and the only game I still have from the event. I scored 2.5 out of 5 overall.",
        "1... f5": "He plays the Dutch Defence https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence",
        "2. Bg5": "This is basically a cheap reply, hoping for h6\n3.\tBh4\tg5\n4.\tBg3\tf4\n5.\te3\tI wouldn't play it now - I don't think it is any good.",
        "2... g6": "But he doesn't fall for that.",

        "5... c6": "At the time I thought this was a bit passive and I still do.",
        "6. e4": "Carrying out my plan. I am already out of my databases - Nf3 or 0-0-0 or e3 are the only moves I can find for white in this position. I still think there is a certain logic to the move though.",
        "6... d6": "This seems passive. Fritz prefers taking on e4. ",
        "7. f4": "Hoping to continue with e4-e5. This is very aggressive. Fritz prefers Nf3 or exf5",
        "7... O-O": "Fritz is still preferring black to take on e4.",
        "8. e5": "So I continue to advance. Fritz likes this move, but only gives the position as level. At the time I thought I had an advantage already. Fritz now likes for black 8...Ne4 9. Nxn4 fxe4 10. Qxe4 Qa5+ and black has enough compensation for the pawn.",
        "8... Ne8": "But instead black retreats and Fritz gives an advantage to white.",

        "12. h3": "I am not sure why I played this. Fritz doesn't like it.",

        "17. Be3": "My bishop drops back, attacking his queen. Just look at the position! Black is a pawn up, but his only piece in play is his queen, which is vulnerable to attack. At the time I knew I had adequate compensation. Fritz confirms this, and give white as over plus 2 now. ",
