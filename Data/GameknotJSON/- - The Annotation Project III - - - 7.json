        "1. e4": "Bobby Fischer said 1.e4 was \"best by test\" but is it really? According to the GK world database 1. Na3 has a 54% winning percentage and Black has not won a game!\r\n\r\nso I had this tournament begun with 1. Na3 instead,Black would never win. There's some food for thought ;)\r\n\r\nok back to the game...",
        "1... c6": "Caro-Kann. The first tournament derived from a Grand Prix attack and the 2nd from a bird's opening.",
        "2. f4": "White loves moving his pawn to f4 in these type of tournaments",
        "2... d5": "getting the usual strike in the center",
        "3. Nf3": "just ignore his threat. who cares about the e4 pawn?",
        "3... dxe4 4. Ng5": "attack the e4 pawn and target f7",
        "4... Nf6": "protecting the e4 pawn",
        "5. Bc4": "aiming at f7.",
        "5... Bg4": "!? an interesting move. surely safer would be 5...e6 but Black cannot resist the opportunity to attack the Queen (please note,this is all thematic the first move made willingly is move 7",
        "6. Qxg4": "?!!? White spices it up. You dare to attack my Queen? I'll take it. Most of the time this logic does not work but here it certainly makes it interesting",
        "6... Nxg4 7. Bxf7+": "The first move I made but this might as well be included in it because there really isn't a reason to not take the f-pawn",
        "7... Kd7": "only move",
        "8. Be6+": "This is where the pawn on c6 changes the identity of the game.\r\n\r\nIn the last 2 annotation projects,Black has had the luxury of playing 8...Kc6 which is considered to be the best move. However,Black is now unable to move his king to c6.",
        "8... Ke8 9. Bf7+": "a psychological trick of sorts. I would imagine Freddy panicked that I was just going for the perpetual.",
        "9... Kd7 10. Be6+": "all part of my plan",
        "10... Kc7": "It works. I wanted Black to play this move all along. But why would I ask to be invited to a tournament with an attacking opening only to chicken out into a perpetual. Sure it would be my first master draw but why make it so hollow?",
        "11. Bxg4": "I finally take the Knight",
        "11... Kb6": "to avoid the possible fork on e6.",
        "12. Na3": "I was very well considering playing 12. Nf7 here. the comp gives 12. a4 here but I like the plan 12...a6 13...Ka7 here",
        "12... e5": "striking back in the center and hoping to remove the defender of the knight on g5",
        "13. Nc4+ Ka6": "Here, Freddy admits he was just looking for a way to draw here. a master just hoping for a draw against a class C-D player on the 13th move. Was my position that good?\r\n\r\napparently the comp doesn't think so still gives -1.11 ( a pawn in favor of Black) but I still have a chance. Figuratively not literally",
        "14. Nxe5 Qf6 15. Be2+": "always give a check,it could be mate. If that logic was true I should have won the game on move 7,4 checks ago.",
        "15... Kb6": "Now here,I have to admit I was a little panicked. Now Black can escape to c7. I don't have all of my attacking force yet.",
        "16. d3": "developing the minor piece,only thinking of the attack later",
        "16... exd3 17. Be3+ Kc7 18. Bxd3": "I have to admit White's position is pretty nice. But Black can face the future with confidence. ",
        "18... Nd7": "funny how now the f4 pawn gets in the way. If I was able to play 19.Rf1 White would have the makings of a deadly attack",
        "19. Ne4": "better is 19.Nxd7 now Black takes control of the game",
        "19... Qh4+ 20. g3 Qh5 21. Be2": "Black has to stop the threat of 21...Qf3 but the computer gives this as a mistake and gives 21.O-O which I will have to agree with seeing what happened later",
        "21... Qf5": "! White is now drifting closer to 0-1",
        "22. Bd3 Nxe5 23. fxe5 Qf3": "Black still has to be careful 23...Qxe5?? 24. Bf4 would be disasterous for Black",
        "24. Kd2": "only move",
        "24... Bb4+ 25. c3 Rad8": "the critical juncture",
        "26. Ng5": "?? the game-losing blunder as Freddy and the computer pointed out 26.Rhe1 was necessary to survive",
        "26... Qg2+ 27. Kc1 Rxd3 28. Re1 Ba3": "at this point Freddy announced a mate in 5. Masters are so modest aren't they?",
        "29. Rb1": "losing quicker but losing nonetheless",
        "29... Rxc3+ 30. Kd1 Qc2#": "mate,hopefully I will get Freddy next time"
