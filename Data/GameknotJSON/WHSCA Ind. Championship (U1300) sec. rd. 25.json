        "1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 c5": "This was a somewhat premature push for the center, and so I reacted how I normally would in this position, with 5.cxd5.",
        "5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. Nxd5 Qxd5 7. Qc2": "If 7...cxd4, I'll win the bishop.",
        "7... Nc6 8. dxc5 Bxc5 9. a3 Bb6": "I believe Black was either anticipating 10. b4 with this move or preparing to prompt the exchange of queens with 10...Qc5.",
        "10. e3 O-O 11. Bd3 g6 12. O-O Ne5 13. Be4 Qc4": "Blundericious...",
        "14. Nxe5": "He definitely should have taken the knight before doing this.",
        "14... Qxc2 15. Bxc2 f6 16. Nc4 Bc7 17. Rd1 e5 18. h3": "Preventing Bg4",
        "18... b6 19. Bb3 Kg7 20. e4 Bb7": "Another blunder...",
        "21. Rd7+ Kh8": "Another option is Rf7, but that would lead to 22. Rxf7 Kxf7 23. Nxb6! which for me would win a pawn and rook minus a knight, instead of just a bishop.",
        "22. Rxc7 Bxe4 23. Nd6": "My peices move ever closer to the attack.",
        "23... Bd3 24. Nf7+ Rxf7": "Probably the least problematic approach for black.",
        "25. Rxf7 f5": "An unneeded pawn push in an attempt to save the f pawn. Better would have been g5, since after the rook takes f6 at least the king can come to g7.",
        "26. Bh6 Rg8 27. Rxa7 e4": "Another unnecessary pawn push leaves my opponent helpless. He didn't even see the discovered attack on his rook.",
        "28. Bxg8 Kxg8 29. Rg7+ Kh8": "At least Black would have had some time bought if Kf8.",
        "30. Rf7 Kg8 31. Rf8#": "After a long day, I finish 2-0. It was a victory to be proud of, considering I did not at the time know my own strengh. Round three started the following morning. "
