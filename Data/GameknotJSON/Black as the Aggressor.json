        "1. e4 c5": "This is the first game of two that I won against cheeseburger12, where I tried a different tactic as black,  in that I would try some different positions in the first few moves of the opening to become the aggressor. It worked out very well and forced white off its game",
        "2. Bc4 e6": "White BC4, Black pawn to e6. Typically I would advance Nc6 however in this game I wanted to change it up a bit.",
        "3. Nf3 Bd6": "White advances Nf3, Black advances Bd6 (This advance of the black bishop was one of the test positions)",
        "4. O-O Qf6": "White castles, Black advances Qf6 (Another test position by black). Note white Knight position, expecting line of dark squared bishop of white to open to attack the black queen which I noticed after I moved the Queen",
        "5. d3 Ne7": "white pawn to d3 (dark squared white bishop line now open), black Ne7",
        "6. Bg5 Qxb2 7. Nbd2": "Black advances Queen b2 (My choices of movement were really quite limited so might as well take the pawn), white moves Knight Nb2",
        "7... Nbc6 8. Re1": "black advances Nc6, white rook to e1",
        "8... f6 9. Bh4": "Not wanting to exchange my Knight on e7, I advance pawn to f6. White retreats bishop to h4",

        "10... Nd4 11. Nxd4": "At this point in the game, I knew I had to get my Queen back over to the other side of the board, but again with White Nf3 space is limited. Need to remove the white knight. So exchange occurs (black Nd4- White Nxd4)",
        "11... Qxd4 12. Nb3": "Black Queen takes White Knight, White advances to Nb3 attacking black queen",
        "12... Qe5 13. a5": "Black Queen re positions to e5. Note that black is in a more preferred position. Black Bd5 supporting attack on H2, black also has good center control.",

        "14... Qxh4 15. a6": "Black Queen captures bishop. White advances pawn to a6. Not sure why white spent so much time moving the pawn down the board. I assume to free up the rook or fork the black bishop and rook on B7 but in my view those moves should of been spent on other pieces. ",
        "15... Ng6 16. Re3": "black advances Ng6, White responds with Rook to e3. Note sure of white's move here Not many options. advancing pawns would further break the pawn line and the white queen would be somewhat limited to assist",

        "17... Qxg2 18. axb7": "Black Queen takes pawn on g2, White takes pawn on b7 and forks the bishop and rook",
