    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "Sometime you lose by weak moves, but it is not clear were the mistake is... ",
        "1... d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qe5+ 4. Qe2 Qxe2+ 5. Bxe2 c6": "Always necessary in order to prevent the white knight to jump aiming to c7. ",
        "6. d4": "It seems an innocent move, but it puts white in troubles. ",
        "6... Bf5": "The good thing about this opening is that, even if black seems to be underdeveloped, at this point almost every move is \"good\". ",
        "7. Bd1": "The \"original\" move by white is not good, in my opinion. The price of this uneasy bishop in d8 will create an edge for black. White can play Bd3. After the exchange, experience tells that the doubled central pawns are not such a disadvantage as they seem to be at the first glance. \nYou can choose between let the c2 pawn and develop, or defend it with the king. It is not very important to lose castling rights when the queens are out of the game. ",
        "7... e6": "All the ways are open for black. And I prevent d5, the \"strong\" move for white. ",
        "8. Nge2": "Another questionable move by white. I think Nf3 is better. Maybe he was thinking about pushing the kingside pawns. But Bf4 was the good one for white. ",
        "8... Bd6": "Now, I am occupying the strong black diagonal. ",
        "9. O-O": "Ok, he can castle kingside. But is it that important?",
        "9... Nd7 10. Bf4": "Now I lose the black bishop, but exchanging it for him, so no problem. ",
        "10... Bxf4 11. Nxf4": "What is really doing his knight in f4?",
        "11... Ngf6": "Black is now free to develop as he wants. The plan Re1, followed by d5, comes too late for white. ",
        "12. f3": "Planning, as foreseen, a pawn storm on the kingside... and exchange my wsb. But the rooks are not communicated.",
        "12... h5": "Of course, I can castle queenside, which I consider the normal plan for black in this scheme.",
        "13. Re1": "It was interesting for white Nxh4, followed by g4. I followed some variants, but it seemed to me that there was no advantage for white in it. He must have thought the same, since he played the rook.",
        "13... g5": "As before, he can take the h5 pawn. If RxN, g4 returns the piece. But his king will be very exposed. Still, so was mine, after gxB, R moves, and fxd3, so it would have been a good choice for white.",
        "14. Nfe2": "Aha. Now, white is very cramped. ",
        "14... O-O-O": "And my rooks communicate, with a good edge. ",
        "15. Ng3 Bg6": "Now it is impossible for him to stop MY pawns.",
        "16. Nce4 g4": "If Ng5, I can defend f7 or even play Rh-g8!",
        "17. c3": "A tempo lost in order to free the bishop. Of course, my plan is NOT to take on f3, I don't want to help him. Maybe more dangerous for me was c4, hurrying the break in d5. ",
        "17... h4 18. Nxf6": "This knight would have been better in g5. This way, it simply helps me. ",
        "18... Nxf6": "Maybe, I should have been more aggressive and play hxg3, but Nxg4 is good for him.",
        "19. Ne4 Nxe4 20. fxe4 f5 21. Bc2": "Better for him to exchange pawns? But probably I would have taken with the bishop. Or Bb3, creating some threat on e6. Anyway, not easy for white. To tell the truth, there was not any \"blunder\" by white. Simply, small half-weak moves... but that is all it's needed to lose a game.",
        "21... f4": "Now, my pawns look really stormy!",
        "22. Rac1": "More tempos to defend. Now, I think I have a strong edge, but... how to materialize it? Better, I think, was Bb3, pressing my e6 pawn - my weak one! Probably, this was the real mistake by white.",
        "22... h3": "Or f3? Decisions! I must avoid him to block the pawns. ",
        "23. b4": "Attacking? It's a dream!",
        "23... hxg2 24. Kxg2": "How to go on? I thought about Rh3, that was a good move too. ",
        "24... f3+ 25. Kg3 Rdg8": "It comes tactics. Kxg4, Bh5++ followed later by f2... still, not an insurance!",
        "26. e5 f2": "He cannot take it because of Rxh2 and loses the bishop...",
        "27. Ref1 Rh3+": "If Kxg4, Bf4++ followed with stormy checks, ending into a mate or loses the bishop.",
        "28. Kg2 Rxc3": "Playing modestly, but I didn't see a clear win after BxB or Rf3. You have to choose to pursuit a phantom attack or to get a good final game... ",
        "29. Rxf2": "maybe it was wiser for white BxB, RxR, RxR, RxB, Kxf2. ",
        "29... Be4+": "Wonderful pin...",
        "30. Kg1 g3": "Yummy move. I expected Re2, to which I would have played Bd3... Rd2, and things like that. But he made it easier for me.",
        "31. hxg3 Rcxg3+ 32. Kf1": "If Kh2, Rg3 moves for example to g6, and white cannot avoid mate in one. ",
        "32... Rg3g1+ 33. Ke2": "I will lose the wonderful white bishop, but a quality is a quality! And he will lose another pawn in addition.",
        "33... Rxc1 34. Bxe4 Rc4 35. Kd3 Rxb4 36. Bh7 Rd8": "Why not Rf4, in order to defend? Maybe he is seeking for Rf6, but he has no time for that.",
        "37. Kc3": "The normal and wise move here is Rb4xd4. I followed phantoms, and played...",
        "37... Rdxd4 38. Bg8": "Aha. Now I lose the e6 pawn. The only way to make it less stupid I found was...",
        "38... Rbc4+ 39. Kb3 Rc5 40. Bxe6+ Kd8": "Now, if Rf8+, Ke2 and white is lost. This was my original plan. ",
        "41. Re2": "The e pawn is his only hope. ",
        "41... Ke7 42. Bc8": "He cannot take the b pawn if I play Rd4-d5, due to Rb5+ and he loses the bishop without compensation. But I wanted to give a sense to the loss of my e6 pawn, so I tried to crunch his king.",
        "42... b5 43. Re3": "This was to prevent Rd3+, and his king has to retire to b2 or there is a mate coming (Kb4, Rc4+, Ka5, Ra3#).",
        "43... a5": "I feared all the time e6 and Rf3, but he didn't go for it. ",
        "44. Bb7": "Look at this nice mate:\n\n44.\tBb7\t\tKe6\n45.\tBc8+\t\tKd5\n46.\te5-e6\t\tRd4-b4+\n47.\tKa3\t\tKc4\n48.\tRe4+\t\tKc3\n49.\tRe3+\t\tKd4\n50.\te7\t\tRc3+\n51.\tRxc3\t\tKxc3\n52.\te8=Q\t\tRa4#\n\nDifferent variations of this theme grant me the win... or I hope this!",
        "44... Ke6 45. Bc8+": "He went for it.",
        "45... Kd5": "Now, he must have felt really good. Apparently, I let him hope to reach the 8\u00ba row, and as a minimum to recover material... ",
        "46. e6 Rb4+": "Ok, this is my plan. If he plays the best, he gets in a lost position. Otherwise, he's mated. Really, really nice. I set the following conditional moves: \n\n47. Ka3 (forced), Kd4 He cannot abandon the 3\u00ba row, or he's mated. \n48. e7\tRc3+ \n49. Rxc3 (forced), Kxc3 and mate in one, no matter white's move.\n\nThe best move for white, and the only one able to prevent mate, is:\n48. Rb3, to which I have another nice move: Rc2, threatening mate with Ra4. \n\n49. Rb2 is met simply by Rb4xR, so the only reasonable move for white is\n\n49. RxR+\ta5xR\n\nLet's see some sequences: \n\n50. Kxb4 loses, because of Rb2+.\n\nIf 51. Ka3, \tKc3, and after any white move, \n52. \t\tb4+\n53. Rxa2#\n\nIf 51. Ka5, the only one able to avoid mate, Kc5\n52. Ka6 (forced), Ra2+\n53. Kb7 (forced), and white cannot stop the black pawn. The plans can be both: \n\n53. ..., Kd6, and white has two answers: Bd7 (met by Rc2) and Kb6, met by b4 and goes to queen, even if I havt to sacrifice my rook for the bishop. To give me the pawn with e7, in order to free the bishop, fails since my king has time to come near my pawn again - or the b pawn gets to queen. \n\nBut white has another good move, if he doesn't take the b4 pawn: \n\n50. Kb3\n\nI have to answer Re2. If he takes the pawn, we get into the previous variants. Otherwise (by moving the bishop) I play Kc5, protecting my pawns... and this should be a win. \n\nYou see, all these calculations may seem excessive in such a strong position. But... what if I get only draw? I would shoot myself! :-)))",
        "47. Ka3 Kd4": "As planned. ",
        "48. Rh3": "The \"bad\" one. I would have liked more resistance, with Rb3. Probably I would have won, but work had still to be done.",
