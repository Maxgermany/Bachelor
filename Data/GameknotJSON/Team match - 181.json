        "3. d5": "Not in the database.  But it is how I would have responded as white.",
        "3... Bc5 4. Nc3 Bb4": "Black has moved two pieces two times.",

        "30... Ra8 31. Nc6 Rba6 32. c4": "This was probably a blunder.  The white king can get pushed back, and white risks losing Rf2 as a consequence.",
        "32... Ra6a3+ 33. Kc2 Ra3xa2+ 34. Kd3": "A definite blunder.  Black brilliantly goes for the white king's throat instead of snatching the free rook.",
