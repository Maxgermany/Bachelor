        "4. Bxc4 e6": "This move prevents me from playing Qb3 which forks b7 and f7 and allows his DSB out.",
        "5. Nf3 f6": "?! Weakens the diagonal for nothing.",
        "6. Nc3 Bb4 7. Bd2": "Breaking the pin",
        "7... c6": "?! This takes away his queen's knight's favorite square.",
        "8. Qb3 a5 9. a3": "? I was just delaying capturing on e6, but this allows him to divert my attack.",
        "9... Bxc3 10. Qxc3": "Ugggh now I can't win his e pawn.",
        "10... b5 11. Bb3 Ne7 12. e4": "If he captures, I can take his e pawn.",

        "13... b4 14. axb4 axb4": "I miscalculated here, I thought that he couldn't recapture because it was pinned to his rook, I didn't notice that this attacks my queen. I also can't take his pawn because then he could smash my rook.",
        "15. Qc1 Rxa1 16. Qxa1 Bxf3 17. gxf3": "My pawn structure gets smashed...",
        "17... Qxd4": "And I lose a pawn. Things are looking pretty bad",
        "18. O-O": "?? I make them worse with a truly stupid blunder.",
        "18... Qxd2 19. Qa8": "Well I'm not going to roll over and die, I'll put up a fight.",
        "19... Qd8 20. Re1 Ng6": "?? Allows a discovered attack that will win...A pawn...that's not really worth the trouble, so I play something else.",
        "21. Qb7": "! Threatens mate",
        "21... Ne5": "Better would have been Qe7",
        "22. Rxe5": "!! If he recaptures I have mate.",
        "22... fxe5": "??? final blunder",
        "23. Qf7#": "And checkmate. While it had a lot of mistakes, I felt it was a good combo even if it was aided by my opponent."
