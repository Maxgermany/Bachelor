        "2... Nf6": "Oh, a switch-a-roonie by black, and out comes the Petroff. Very cool, I really enjoy the petroff!!",
        "3. Bc4": "White takes a road somewhat less traveled here, the Petroff-Italian Variation. Now that we have our opening well established, let's see if White stays the course or risks uncharted waters. Should be fun!!",
        "3... Nxe4": "I'm going to stay the course and play as accurate as I can, afterall my opponent has both tempo and out-rates quit a bit.",
        "4. Qe2": "At this point the percentages favor black, but let's see if I have what it takes, it's early days still.",
        "4... d5": "Black stays the course.",
        "5. Bb3": "Nxe5 perhaps a little more accurate, Bb3 is still good. Lots of play remaining",
        "5... Bg4": "Black continues to stay the course. These waters are still fairly well charted."
