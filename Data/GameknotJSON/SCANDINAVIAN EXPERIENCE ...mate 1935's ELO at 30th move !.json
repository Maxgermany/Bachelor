        "3. Nc3": "problems coming...",
        "3... Qd6": "this was my resolution, the experiment this position.\r\ni think it's quite good, because the queen can move where ever she whant. \r\ni just have to be very carefull and never forget to develop before it become to late...",
        "4. d4": "white develop\r\nmaybe preparing a to soon atack like Nb5 ?\r\ni dont care, i attack d4 !",

Qa6": "this is it !!\r\nbut there is still a problem : \r\nif i play rd1, white will cancel the threat whith qxe6+, then i have to exchange the queens and there is no more mate, or i put the d8 rook between (d6) and it can become a draw (white qf8, Rd6 d8 ...etc)\r\nBUT THIS TIME I WAS LUCKY ! white make a mistake moving Rc1 e1...",
