        "1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4": "The standard position of the Caro-Kann. Black has a number of playable options.",
        "4... Nf6": "Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann would be pleased. This was their way of attacking White's centarlized Knight -- certainly the most direct method to challege the horseman.",
        "5. Bd3": "Against a fellow master, Koltanowski -- and most modern grandmasters -- would undoubtedly play 5 NxN, inflicting a weakness in the Black Pawn structure. Against a mere amateur, however, he elects to retain the central tension.",
        "5... Qxd4 6. Nf3": "Developing with tempo, attacking the Q.",
        "6... Qd8 7. Qe2 Bf5": "Threatening to drain off all the White attacking power with 8... NxN 9 BxN BxB 10 QxB, and thus forcing White's hand.",
        "8. Nxf6+": "Initiating the attack and weakening the Black K-side.",
        "8... gxf6": "Forced, as the KP is pinned.",
        "9. Bxf5": "Leaving Black no alternative if he doesn't want to be down a piece.",
        "9... Qa5+": "The only way to regain the piece.",
        "10. Bd2": "Clearing the way for his next move.",
        "10... Qxf5": "The only piece Black has in play is his Q. He must immediately try to find a haven for his King and get his pieces activated.",
        "11. O-O-O": "Seizing the open file with his Rook. Black's best course of action is probably 11... N-Q2 followed by 12... O-O-O.",
        "11... Qe6": "Instead, Black gets greedy. He thinks he's forcing Koltanowski to exchange Queens or lose another Pawn.",
        "12. Qd3": "Koltanowski has a different plan.",
        "12... Qxa2": "Black's fatal error. 12... N-Q2 was still probably best, to be followed by 13... O-O-O.",
        "13. Qd8+": "Koltanowski pounces.",
        "13... Kxd8": "Forced.",
        "14. Ba5+": "A deadly double check.",
        "14... Kc8": "14... K-K1 is answered the same way.",
        "15. Rd8#": "Finis."
