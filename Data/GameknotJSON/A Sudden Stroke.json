        "10. Na4": "Not only to blockade the pawn but to penetrate into the holes in White's queenside. 10. Bb5 is most often played here.",
        "10... Nd7": "Black wants to play 11...b6, but his pieces become awkwardly placed in the queenside.",

        "12. Bb5": "White already has a strong initiative.",
        "12... Bb7": "Better would have been 12...Qc7 13. Qf2 Rb8. Then White could have chosen between tightening his grip on the queen file by 14. Rd3 and Rhd1 later or initiating a Kingside pawn-storm with 14. h4 and 15. g4. But now the b-pawn is lost.",

        "16... Ba6 17. Bxc6": "White sees correctly that it is of more value to exchange Black's knight rather than his light-squared bishop which will remain inert at the sides.",
        "17... Qxc6 18. Nb6 Rab8 19. Rd2": "To tighten the grip on the d-file.",
        "19... Rb7": "Black concentrates on his own half-open file.",
        "20. b3": "Since the knight must move.",
        "20... Rfb8 21. Nd5 Bd8": "Disdains the exchange of the bishop, but 21...Bf8 was preferable.",

        "24. Nf6+": "The Sudden Stroke! quite unexpected to Black. Aside from the text, I also looked at 24. Ba7 which also wins against all defences:\r\nA. 24...Rxb4 25. Nxb4 (25.
