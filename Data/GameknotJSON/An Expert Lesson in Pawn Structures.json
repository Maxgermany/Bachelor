Things seemed to be going OK and then my kingside pawn structure got busted.  I then went into a K & P ending and Henry then got bogged down with disastrous results.  How does it happen?  Well, here we go .....",

Gameknot gives my score as  -9.55 which is more than a whole queen down so the resignation is justified.  The moral and the lesson here is, if your pawn structure is busted there is even less room for innaccuracies, especially when playing against somebody of near-master strength!\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n"
