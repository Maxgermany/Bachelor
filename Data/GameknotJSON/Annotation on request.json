    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "It's been a while since I annotated someone else's game, so naturally when no_genius sent me a request to annotate this GK blitz win I jumped at the chance :)",
        "1... c6": "\"I thought I'd play a Caro-Kann\", as no_genius put it.",
        "2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3": "Exchange variation. Often seen as quieter and less interesting than the main lines, and White is not considered to have much advantage.",
        "4... Nf6": "The normal move here is 4... Nc6, since the bishop has interfered with the queen's defence of the d4 pawn, so White then plays 5. c3 and loses a development tempo.",
        "5. Nf3": "Curiously, the world DB recommends 5. c3 even though Black has not attacked the pawn. Presumably the reasoning is that the move will have to be played sooner or later anyway. In any case, the next two moves by each side are obvious, and we reach the same position regardless of the order they are played in.",
        "5... Bg4 6. O-O Nc6 7. c3 Qc7": "The DB gives this as only the second most common move, after 7... e6, but again the two lines are likely to transpose into each other.",
        "8. Re1 e6 9. Bg5": "(?!) Recommended is 9. Nbd2, so that 9... Bd6 can be met with 10. Nf1!",
        "9... Be7": "This move seems at first sight rather less enterprising than 9... Bd6. If White exchanges on f6, the bishop will be poorly placed whichever capture Black chooses; and if the intention behind this move was to avoid gxf6, then surely Black ought to be glad of the chance to add a rook on a half-open file to his accumulating pressure on White's kingside? However, Black's subsequent play reveals that this move was part of a consistent plan.",
        "10. Nbd2 h6": "Time to leave the DB. Only three games reached this position; 10... h6, 10... 0-0 and 10... Bh5 were played once each, all three games being Black wins.",
        "11. Bxf6": "White immediately deviates from Gottlieb-Rousell, in which Bh4 was played. The capture allows gxf6, as I mentioned in a previous comment, but probably after 9... Be7 White had confidence Black would not play this move.",
        "11... Bxf6 12. Qc2": "Gets out of the pin and connects the rooks. All the same, it's not clear what White's plan of attack is going to be. White misses the dark-squared bishop here, since he can't try to establish a central majority by b3 and c4 as this would allow d4 to be taken.",
        "12... Rc8": "Black's intentions are clear, at least: \"Place your rook on the line of the queen, whatever the pieces that lie between.\" This is the start of a minority attack, aiming to divert the c3 pawn from its defence of d4. This plan justifies Black's choice of 11... Bxf6.",
        "13. h3": "\"Let's settle this once and for all.\" White wants the pieces on d2 and g4 removed from the board to give his other pieces more room to rearrange themselves.",
        "13... Bxf3": "Black has no choice, since 13... Bh5?? 14. g4 Bg6 15. Bxg6 fxg6 16. Qxg6+ not only wins a pawn but makes the backward pawn on e6 an instant target. And of course 13... Bf5?? just loses the piece, since the e-pawn is pinned.",
        "14. Nxf3 Kd7": "Black chooses not to castle, in view of the fact that White could now plan an attack with Qd2, Bc2 and Qd3, and Black lacks the kingside knight to defend against this. Moving out of the e-file pin before beginning to advance the queenside pawns was a pragmatic decision.",
        "15. Re2": "White begins to double the rooks, following another old chess adage and meeting a flank attack with a central one. Presumably White intends to advance the pawn to f5. It begins to look like we're in for quite an exciting middlegame.",
        "15... a6 16. Rae1 b5 17. a3": "Black's attack is getting there faster, and White must take time out to inhibit the pawns from advancing further, especially with the queen still on the file Black is trying to open.",
        "17... Na5": "I think I would have played 17... Qb6 here, intending to continue advancing with ...a5. This requires the b5 pawn to be defended first, and moving the queen also makes the rook's veiled attack on the enemy queen more imminent. With the move played, the knight is heading for c4, a good square, but too easily challenged with Nd2.",
        "18. Ne5+": "The knight vacates the file for the pawn's advance. This is the most forceful way of doing so, gaining tempo and simultaneously controlling the c4 square. Black is forced to exchange (an exchange that favours White, since the knight was not useful to his plans, while Black's bishop was defending the e7 square), as otherwise the a5 knight is simply misplaced.",
        "18... Bxe5 19. Re2xe5 Nc4": "Black gains a tempo in return by attacking the rook. This time the exchange was not forced, but seems best all the same, since Black's knight is well placed, White no longer has his own knight to challenge it with, and the exchange allows White to keep the initiative.",
        "20. Bxc4 Qxc4": "Black does not want to recapture with either pawn, as that would close the c-file, negating his plan so far. However, the queen capture has a disadvantage:",
        "21. Qd1": "Black's queen is not well placed to get back to defend the kingside pawns, so White is able to keep initiative by attacking them.",
        "21... a5": "Black continues with his original plan.",
        "22. Qf3 Rhf8 23. Qg4 Rfg8": "I think better here is 23... g6 24. Qh4 h5, as then only one pawn (the f7 pawn) is vulnerable and needs to be defended by a rook.",
        "24. Qh5 Rcf8 25. Kh1": "A mysterious king move. Of course there was no danger of Black changing plans and attacking on the kingside, since the f7 pawn cannot move.",
        "25... b4 26. axb4 axb4 27. Qe2": "White decides to bring Black's minority attack to a halt by threatening to exchange queens and create a passed pawn.",
        "27... Qxe2": "Black is correct to initiate the queen exchange, since after 27... bxc3 28. Qxc4 dxc4 29. bxc3 the c4 pawn gets in the way of attacking the base of White's pawn chain.",
        "28. Re5xe2 b3": "(?) Surely 28... bxc3 is correct, for the reason I mentioned in my last comment; Black would like to fix White with a backward pawn on a file available to Black's rooks.",
        "29. f4": "At last!",
        "29... Rfc8 30. f5 Rge8 31. fxe6+ fxe6": "Now Black is the one with the backward pawn. However, White will find it difficult to attack, in view of how much better placed Black's king is than White's. White therefore switches plans and doubles up on the newly opened f-file:",
        "32. Rf2 Re7 33. Ref1 Rce8": "But this is easily met by manning the breach with the rooks. Now if White tries to break through:",
        "34. Rf2f7 Rxf7 35. Rxf7+ Re7 36. Rxe7+ Kxe7": "The result is an exchange of all the rooks, and now it's down to the kings.",
        "37. Kg1 g5": "My first thought was 37... Kd6, trying to make more of Black's better-placed king before White's catches up, but in fact this pawn advance is probably best. Black claims space and gets his pawns closer to the end of the board, thus ensuring that the ...e5 break is much more powerful when it comes. It's important to note that, even though it's the pawns that are doing the work, it is Black's superior king position that gives him the advantage, for two reasons: (1) White must centralise his king, giving Black time to advance the pawns, and (2) there is no possibility of White using the c4 lever as it would take his king too long to get there. White must now be regretting 25. Kh1?, but that was by no means his last mistake in the game.",
        "38. Kf2": "I think White needed to play 38. g4, halting Black's pawns before they can advance any further.",
        "38... Kf6 39. Ke3 h5": "White's king is denied any possibility of advancing on the kingside.",
        "40. g3 Kf5 41. Kf3 h4": "And the advanced position of this outside pawn secures Black the win. The fact that Black's king must retreat is irrelevant, since ...e5 followed by Kxe5 is inevitable anyway.",
        "42. g4+ Kf6 43. Ke3 e5 44. dxe5+ Kxe5 45. Kd3": "Or 45. Kf3 d4 46. cxd4+ Kxd4 47. Ke2 Ke4 48. Kd2 Kf3 49. Kc3 Kg3 50. Kxb3 Kxh3 51. Kc4 Kxg4 and White is still losing the pawn race.",
        "45... Kf4 46. Kd4 Kg3 47. Kxd5 Kxh3 48. c4 Kg3": "An understandable precaution in blitz. In fact 48... Kxg4 was fine, even though White is promoting with check, since Black is also promoting with check and thus has time to ensure that White will not promote at all.",
        "49. c5 h3 50. c6 h2 51. c7 h1=Q+": "Now we have a queen versus a pawn on the seventh rank. This would be interesting without the other pawns, but with them on the board Black just has an easy win by sacrificing his queen for the pawn. (For the record, without the other four pawns Black wins by 52. Kd6 Qh3! keeping White's king from getting in front of the pawn. If Black plays any other move, White has a draw, since the pawn is on a bishop's file and Black's king is too far away.)",
        "52. Kd6 Qh8 53. Kd7 Qg7+ 54. Kd6 Qf8+": "Black should not be able to stop the c-pawn this way, and should just take the quick win by Qxc7+.",
        "55. Kd7 Qf7+ 56. Kd6": "(?) Any other king move and the queen v. pawn duel would be drawn, and Qxc7+ would be the only way to win. After this move...",
        "56... Qe8": "...Black can stop White's king getting back in front of the pawn like this.",
        "57. Kc5 Qc8 58. Kd6 Kxg4": "Black now has an easy win (even if you remove both Black pawns!) so White resigns. Well played, and thanks to no_genius for showing me this game; it was an interesting one to play through."
