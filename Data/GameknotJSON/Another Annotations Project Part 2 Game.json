        "1. f4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nAbout a month ago, antagonistknight and I played this unrated game.  He started off with 1. f4 which was The Bird's Opening and I got the mischevious idea about me playing the black side of another of Freddy's Annotation's Project.  I lost this game but maybe some lessons can be learned from this and hopefully it will be a worthy contribution to the Project.  We will therefore pick up the action on Move 9.  Before I start this, here is the gameknot analysis version of the game which will help you follow the game up to move 9.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14011633&fb=1&rnd=0.054344796625981295",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7": "9. ...... Bg7 - the most popular move of the project and it helps clear those back decks.",
        "10. Nc3": "10. Nc3 - swift development is required with white having only 2 pieces for Glenda.",
        "10... e5 11. O-O exf4 12. Ne6 Qg8": "12. ...... Qg8 - Glenda takes the standard evasive action but she is rather passive on this square.",
        "13. Nxe4 Nd7 14. d4 Nf6": "14. ..... Nf6 - gameknot analysis said that was my first mistake.  It suggested as an alternative 14. ...... h5 - please refer to the link for further detail.",
        "15. Nxf6 Bxf6": "15. ..... Bxf6 - I thought that trading knights would reduce white's firepower but alas it does not and white's dsb comes into the fray.",
        "16. Bxf4 Re8 17. d5+ Kd7 18. Bg3": "18. Bg3 - this move now opens up a line for the WR on f1 to attack Fou Lenoir.",
        "18... Ke7 19. Rae1 h5": "19. ....... h5 - too little too late, now comes a nasty discovered check which will win the rook on e1 for starties.  Also, Fou Lenoir is very vulnerable as if Henry goes onto f2 then he will be caught in a pin and all white has to do is pile on with a move such as Be5.  On making this assessment I waved the white flag.  Well played antagonistknight.",
