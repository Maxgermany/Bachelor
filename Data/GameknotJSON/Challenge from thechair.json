        "1. e4": "so rarely happens in chess. a real underdog result. the last thing i expected when i was playing a 2200 rating was a victory.\r\n\r\nanyhoo.. a kings pawn opening..",
        "1... e5": "gauntlet laid down.",
        "2. Nf3": "huzzah! the knight.",
        "2... Nc6": "getting worried here...",
        "3. Nc3": "nice. have some of that. ",
        "3... Nf6": "hmmm.... ok then. ",
        "4. Bb5": "i like this as it's all about the lines. ",
        "4... Bb4": "i've seen this move somewhere before... in fact i was wondering if he was just toying with me here setting me up for a humiliating defeat. ",
        "5. Bxc6": "so i thought i'd better draw first blood and get some points on the board. \r\n\r\n\r\nand it also gives him the problem of doubled up pawns..",
        "5... dxc6": "which is of course what happened.",
        "6. Nxe5": "and a lack of concentration left me his pawn. i wonder if he is giving this game his full concentration yet?",
        "6... Qe7": "queen out. ",
        "7. f4": "i think this is bold and leaves my knight in an attacking space and none of this running away lark he might have been hoping for.",
        "7... Bxc3": "now i think he is getting desperate..",
        "8. dxc3": "i think i'm in a much better position after this exchange.",
        "8... Nxe4": "bham!",
        "9. O-O": "time to castle. i still like the way it's turning out.",
        "9... O-O": "got him scared. he wastes a move to defend himself.",
        "10. Re1": "this is looking nice for me. a long way to go yet though...",
        "10... f5": "i still don't think he is giving this game proper attention...",
        "11. Be3": "bit of development",
        "11... Be6": "hmmm...",
        "12. Qe2": "i need some queen action",
        "12... Rad8": "this takes a turn for the worse. i don't know where to go from here and i think i'm in an elaborate trap i've never seen before...",
        "13. Red1": "so time to make a stand..",
        "13... Rd5": "hmm.. ok then...",
        "14. a4": "it's getting complicated. note i can't take the pawn on a7 with my bishop as it would be trapped with a b7 to b6 pawn move.",
        "14... Rfd8": "doubled rooks always spell trouble.",
        "15. Bxa7": "but i've seen something. have you spotted it?",
        "15... b6": "he hasn't!",
        "16. Nxc6": "niiiiice!!",
        "16... Qc5+": "but nice comeback",
        "17. Nd4": "but i'm still 2 pawns up and think i'm looking good.",
        "17... Bd7": "moves to protact his bishop..",
        "18. a5": "and i need to do likewise for mine",
        "18... Ra8": "the attack starts.",
        "19. axb6": "a brilliant move. now he is in a world of pain.",
        "19... cxb6": "take back that irritatingly advanced pawn.",
        "20. Bxb6": "and this has opened up multiple attacks.",
        "20... Qxb6": "decides to take the bishop..",
        "21. Rxa8+": "and i get his rook and check to boot.",
        "21... Kf7": "now i'm five points up. i'm starting to think 2200 rating or not, i've got a chance here.",
        "22. Qh5+": "all about the lines. and it's the start of the end for black.",
        "22... Ke7 23. Qxh7": "another free pawn. i'm right in behind now. what has black got left in the locker?",
        "23... Qf6": "a bit of fight. he was on a 20 match winning streak and did not want to give it up without a fight. this is real backs to the wall for black. there is zero threat being posed to the white king here.",
        "24. Qg8": "all i need it to pressure a mistake but there are multiple check mate options open now. ",
        "24... Bb5": "and there is the mistake. no need to push home a victory from here...",
        "25. Qxd5": "as this is where the towel was thrown in.\r\n\r\nso any 1300-1500 players out there. \r\n\r\nyou can do it if i did it! \r\n\r\ngood luck!\r\n\r\n"
