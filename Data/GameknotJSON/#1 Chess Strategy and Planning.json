        "10. Qc6 Rb8 11. Nxd5 Bb7 12. Nxe7+ Qxe7 13. Qa4 Rbc8 14. Qa3": "This move might be said to be the key to white's whole plan. The main point was to able to play Ba6",
        "14... Qe6 15. Bxf6 Qxf6 16. Ba6 Bxf3": "Dr.Lasker thought for over half and hour before deciding on this continuation. It is not only the best ,but it shows at the same time the fine hand of the master. An ordinary player would have never have thought of giving up the exchange in order to keep the initiative in this position , which was really the only reasonable way in which he could hope to draw the game",
        "17. Bxc8 Rxc8 18. gxf3 Qxf3 19. Rg1 Re8 20. Qd3 g6 21. Kf1": "The play here was extremely difficult. I probably did not find the best system of defense. I can not yet tell which was the best defense here, but it is my believe that with the best play white should win",
        "21... Re4 22. Qd1 Qh3+ 23. Rg2 Nf6 24. Kg1 cxd4 25. Rc4": "The move with which I counted upon to check black's attack",
        "25... dxe3 26. Rxe4 Nxe4 27. Qd8+ Kg7 28. Qd4+ Nf6 29. fxe3 Qe6 30. Rf2 g5 31. h4 gxh4": "This wast lasker's sealed move. It was not the best . His chance to draw was to play Kg6. Any other continuation should lose",
        "32. Qxh4 Ng4 33. Qg5+ Kf8 34. Rf5": "Not the best . Rd2 would have won. The text move gives black a chance to draw",
        "34... h5 35. Qd8+ Kg7 36. Qg5+ Kf8 37. Qd8+ Kg7 38. Qg5+ Kf8": "(Dr.Lasker Resigns).A blunder, which loses what would otherwise have been a drawn game. I will be noticed that it was Dr.Lasker's forty-fifth move. He had very little time to think and. Furthermore. By his own admisson, he entirely misjudged the value of the position, Believing that he had chances of winning when in fact, all he could hope for was a draw"
