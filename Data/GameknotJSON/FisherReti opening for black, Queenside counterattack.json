        "1. f4": "In this game, I play black and open with a combination of moves that my Dad calls a \"Bobby Fisher\" opening (which is also called \"Reti\" when it is played for white, and can be the Old Indian in some variants).  It makes for a closed game.  I'm still experimenting with this opening for black and learning things as I go, and I'd truly enjoy your comments on the strengths and weaknesses of this opening for black.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4": "As is fairly typical, this closed opening cedes the center pawns to white.",

        "5... c5 6. Bc4 O-O 7. b3 Nc6 8. Nge2": "Completed the fist 8 moves of this opening.  At this point, there are options to attack the middle or either side, particularly the queenside.",

        "10... b4": "... but I changed my mind and moved b4 first, thus pressuring the knight.",
        "11. Nd5 e5": "... then moved to e5.  At this point, I would have expected f5 or fxe5 ...",
        "12. O-O-O": "... but white long castled? ...",
        "12... exf4": "... thus allowing me to go back on the offensive setting up what would be the beginning of the end at move 17.",

        "24... Bxf1": "The rest of the game was spent making sure I didn't do anything stupid.",
