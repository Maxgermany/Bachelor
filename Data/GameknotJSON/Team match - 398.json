        "2... exf4": "exf4 if probably the best option. Second best would be d5",
        "3. Nf3": "Most popular and less riskiest ( Not sure if that is even a word) kings gambit continuation. This move prevent Qh4+",
        "3... h6": "This is the Beckers defense. The idea is that it will support a g5 thrust and controls the aggressive square g5 for the knight.",
        "4. Bc4": "Continues to add pressure on f7. Any moment he can play Ne5",
        "4... d6": "I have strong dark squares but weak light squares. ",
        "5. O-O Be6": "Exchanging light squared bishops.",
        "6. d3": "Pretty strange move. The idea was probably that he didn't want me to take on e6 with my pawn and play e5 with a nice pawn chain.",
        "6... Bxc4 7. dxc4 g5": "Protects the pawn. Notice how I've barely made any moves apart from pawn moves and exchanges.",
