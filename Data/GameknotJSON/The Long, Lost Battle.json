        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6": "2. ........ Nf6 - this is the Petrov's defense.  Some say it does have a high percentage of draws but for the unwary like myself it does not always work out that way.  The purpose of the Petrov is to counterattack my e pawn.  I decide to defend it by playing 3. Nc3 - this is called the Petrov's 3 knights - but how sound is it?",
        "3. Nc3 Bb4": "3. ...... Bb4! This is a very strong move as it tries to undermine the defence of the e pawn.  I decide to take the pawn on e5 but is this a good idea?",
        "4. Nxe5 O-O": "4........ 0-0 - black castles and is threatening a skewie by playing 5.... Re8.  I decide to play d3 backing up the e pawn but the drawback of this move is that it leaves my c3 knight in a pin.",
        "5. d3 Re8 6. Nf3": "6. Nf3 - the knight goes back to f3 but black has a trick up his sleeve when he plays d5 because the e pawn is PINNED!",
        "6... d5 7. Bd2": "7. Bd2 - I break one of the pins by developing a piece.  My e pawn needs some serious back up.",
        "7... dxe4 8. dxe4": "8. dxe4! Just in time!",
        "8... Nc6 9. Be2": "9. Be2 - I break the pin on the e-file and prepare castling.",
        "9... Bg4 10. O-O Bxc3 11. Bxc3 Nxe4": "11. ...... Nxe4 - regains the pawn and worse still threatens to break up my queenside pawns with NxB.  Would Be1 have been a better alternative here?",
        "12. Re1 Nxc3 13. bxc3 Qf6": "13. ....... Qf6! My queenside pawns have been busted and the Wicked Witch of the West is homing in on them!",
        "14. Nd4": "14. Nd4 - blocks the queen's attach and if black takes the knight I then straighten out my pawns but black has other ideas and exchanges bishops.",
        "14... Bxe2 15. Nxe2 Rad8 16. Nd4": "16. Nd4 - would Qc1 have been a better alternative to moving the knight back?  A plethora of exchanges now leads to me being a pawn minus.",
        "16... Rxe1+ 17. Qxe1 Nxd4 18. cxd4 Qxd4 19. Rb1": "19. Rb1 attacks b7.  I think about moving my king to f1 but with the queens on the board, is this wise?",
        "19... Qd2 20. Qxd2 Rxd2 21. Kf1": "21. Kf1 - the queens have been exchanged and so I now move my king towards the centre.  If black tries to increase his material advantage by playing Rxc2 I will play Rxb7 splitting up black's queenside pawns.  He prevents this by playing b6.",
        "21... b6 22. Rc1": "22. Rc1 - I now back up my c pawn.",
        "22... f5 23. Ke1": "23. Ke1 - the king moves ever closer towards the centre and defends the f pawn and stops the rook doing any further damage.",
        "23... Rd4 24. g3": "24. g3 - after black moves his rook out of the way I prepare h4 and black moves his rook to a4 attacking my a pawn.  He gains a tempo this way so that I am somehow prevented from playing h4.  This costs me dear much much later in the endgame.",
        "24... Ra4 25. Ra1 Ra3 26. f4 Kf7 27. Kd2 Ke6 28. Re1+": "28. Re1    I have a decision to make here, should I remain passive or should my rook counterattack - the course of action I take does not change the result, but does it liven up the game and make it a little more interesting?",
        "28... Kd7 29. Re5 g6 30. Rd5+ Ke8 31. Re5+ Kf7 32. Rd5 Ke7 33. Re5+ Kf6 34. Rd5 Ke7 35. Re5+ Kf7 36. Rd5 Ke8 37. Re5+ Kf8 38. Rd5": "38. Rd5 - over the last few moves I have kept my opponent in check (literally) - now he decides to act.  He moves the pawn to h5.  This pawn turns out to be the killer.",
        "38... h5 39. Rd7": "39. Rd7 - I continue to attack but unfortunately after black moves his pawn to c5 the rook has nothing to attack - at the moment.  It does however confine his king to the back rank.  Normally a rook on your opponent's seventh rank is called \"a bone in the throat\".",
        "39... c5 40. Kc1 Rxa2": "40..... Rxa2 - my opponent increases his lead and threatens to check on a1 so I try and prevent this by playing my king to b1.",
        "41. Kb1 Ra4 42. Rb7 h4": "42. ..... h4!! the start of this plan.  If I take on h4 it breaks up my kingside pawns.  I play my king to b2 but alas it is driven to a2 by a rook check on b4 on move 43.",
        "43. Kb2 Rb4+ 44. Ka2 Re4 45. Rxa7 Re2 46. Kb2 h3": "46.... h3 - strange, I expected black to take on h2 with his rook.  He will do this next move however.  In the meantime me and my rook decide to liquidate black's queenside pawns and get a passer of my own.  It seems to be another Battle of the Wings Part 2, only this time my passer never gets to leave the second rank, black's passer is on the 7th at the end!",
        "47. Ra6 Rxh2 48. Rxb6 Kg7 49. Rb7+ Kh6 50. Rc7 Re2 51. Rxc5 h2 52. Rc8": "52. Rc8 - the queenside pawns have been liquidated over the last few moves as planned and if black queens his pawn then I play my rook to h8 and give him a skewie.  Black sees this though and forces resignation by playing his rook to e7 because it will interpose on h7 and the pawn will safely queen.  It was time to hold out the white flag to my opponent on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.\r\n\r\nAs far as the Experts are concerned, I still have a way to go to reach half point heaven but I was told that I did at least make the game interesting which is a step in the right direction towards such a goal.\r\n\r\nLook forward to your feedback everyone!  Cheers and bye for now.  Joanne",
