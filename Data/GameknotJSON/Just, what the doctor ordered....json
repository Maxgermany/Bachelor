        "1. e4": "My opponent bring some great input to the game, as I hope to have done also, I've kept my ideas about the Keres system is a nice draw weapon against the Sicilian but not much more at this \"correspondence\" slow pace, but what would have happened had I've played 8.bxc6, could things gone wrong for black? or white would have trouble to cope with the asymmetrical pawn structure, and couldn't have managed to hold the draw? \nAfter that, several exchanges, made me believe the game was going to became a boring draw... but then I was wrong, white kept one of the rooks and started pushing some pawns soon putting my position under severe pressure, I was never able to remove my bishop from the front of the e pawn to push it foreword to e5, and white kept gaining space, I needed a break on the other wing, so I've opened a column for my rook and profited from some lack of mobility from white's rook for some moments I thought I was going to win easily attacking white's pawns from behind but then 31.e5! increased the tension on the king's wing and 34.Bd1! forcing another of my pawn to a light square made me step down to reality, this was going to be a draw, but an hard fought one!\nCongrats vobonk for a nice game",
        "1... c5 2. Ne2": "Sicilian Keres system",
        "2... g6 3. Nbc3 Bg7 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 Nc6": "and now we will transpose to a more common dragon Sicilian",
        "6. Be3 Nf6 7. Qd2 Ng4": "to defend against Bh6 and avoid the exchange of the dragon bishop, if white intends to castle long he needs to deal with my bishop on the long a1-h8 diagonal",
        "8. Nxc6 dxc6": "bxc6 would allow me more fighting chances, but for now I'll prefer to keep a symmetrical pawn structure, before trying any offensive... ",
        "9. Qxd8+ Kxd8": "the exchange of queens allowed me to keep my king in the centre without almost any danger, Kc7 is a possible future move to control d6,d7,d8 with it, for now white's dark square bishop refrains me from playing Kc7 so if white plays rook to d1 either directly or by castling, I think Ke8 is better for now... queens off the board and the symmetrical structure it starts to look a bit drawish... much like my game against Simoman http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lets-play-chess?gm=41316, but in that one, I was able to turn the events to my advantage",
        "10. Bd2": "surprised me, now f2 is somewhat weak, I'll try Bd4 with the idea Nxf2",
        "10... Bd4": "I have nothing better, white should find the one and only Nd1",
        "11. Nd1 Be6": "again nothing better, white has as easier game I don't have any plan so I'll keep developing my last pieces...",
        "12. f3": "white diverged from Gajadin D (SUR) - Mukabi John (KEN), Bled (Slovenia), 2002  but now has a closed in light squared bishop... let's see what can be done here Ne5 with the idea Ne5 inviting f4 Ng4 back to g4 again to invite some pawn push h3 Nf6 and if e5 then Nh5 and white's overextended pawn offer me a plan to exchange a couple more pieces and undermine those pawns.\n12.h3 as played in the referred game might be slightly better as avoids Ng4 and prepares the immediate f4 (if black plays Ne5) without losing a tempo",
        "12... Ne5": "now f4 by white is a possibility... I hope he does play it to try some ideas",
        "13. Be3": "another exchange and the game again looks drawish",
        "13... Bxe3 14. Nxe3 f6": "improving my pawn structure with an eye on the endgame, my bishop has more freedom to move around, Kc7 now possible and Nd7 might be possible also",
        "15. a3": "also white improves his pawn structure with just the light squared bishops on board pawns on dark squares are harder to attack",
        "15... Kc7": "now my king will help to secure the defence of the d column, so I'll let with occupy it with his rooks and try to exchange one of the rooks to make it harder for him to infiltrate my position",
        "16. O-O-O": "expected",
        "16... Nd7": "h5 was also considered here to gain some space, Nd7-c5 is the plan now to keep an eye on e4 in the future Bc8 to get the chance to play e5",
        "17. Be2": "expected white is connecting rooks to occupy the d column",
        "17... Rhd8 18. h4 Nc5": "as planed",
        "19. Rxd8 Rxd8": "now the open column is mine... for a while I expect Rd1",
        "20. h5 g5": "only move, avoiding opening more columns and placing another pawn in a dark square now h5 can be attacked but I'll not play h6, as white's Nf5 or g4 would be devastating, white can probably try b4 at some point in the future to remove my knight from c5 and try f4",
        "21. b4": "expected, now g3 to support f4, but I have a5 and the knight back to c5 if white captures a5, plus after it Ra8 aimed a a3",
        "21... Nd7": "forced",
        "22. g3 a5 23. f4 axb4": "black followed his plan blindly (his last three move were all predictable, but precipitated) now faces another open column and my rook can infiltrate his field",
        "24. axb4": "forced",
        "24... Ra8": "occupying the open column and threatening Ra1+ wining the rook",
        "25. Kd2 Ra4": "hitting b4 and forcing white to defend it ",
        "26. Rb1": "now white has committed his rook to the defence of b4",
        "26... c5": "forcing white to chose between Kc3 and c3",
        "27. c3 Ra2+": "the natural move",
        "28. Ke1 Nb6": "threatens Na4",
        "29. Rc1 Na4 30. h6 Kd8": "now I threat to move my king on to the opposite wing setting a trap for white, if he tries to stop my king with Bb5 I will protect my knight with Bb3 with the idea Rh2 aimed a the h6 knight and h1+ to win the rook, several threats then for white to cope with",
        "31. e5": "! still white has another way of putting me under pressure and create another tension point to localize my attention on other part of the board",
        "31... gxf4 32. gxf4 fxe5 33. fxe5 Kc7": "so I've solved the immediate tensions and opened up the position for now white's rook is occupied with the c pawn defence I'l opt to again close the d column",
        "34. Bd1": "! forced me to place yet another pawn on a light square",
        "34... b5": "light squares might give white some counter play against them, but still I'm better placed to attack white's pawns, just have to find a hole (and opportunity) to pass my rook on to the other wing",
        "35. Be2 c4": "I'm starting to dislike my position all my pawns (but one) on light squares, I'll now try to exchange the bishops, and move my rook to the d column",
        "36. Kf2 Bf7": "played with tempo the idea is that threatens the e2 bishop so white must do something about it",
        "37. Nf5 Bh5": "now forcing the exchange of bishops Nd4 Bxe2 Nxe2 Rd2, and the draw seams closer now",
        "38. Nd4 Bxe2 39. Nxe2 Rd2 40. e6": "Rd5 and I can start writing this game epitaph...",
        "40... Rd5": "my opponent commented Rd6 but I prefer to N get a distant passed pawn, as it gives me more leverage the b and c pawns are controlled by the king, and with a distant passed pawn only black has a chance to play for a win, but even then only with white playing inferior moves... with correct play white should hold the draw perhaps simplifying in to a rook's endgame with one pawn deficit",
        "41. Kf3 Rh5 42. Rd1 Nb6": "denying white's the access to d7, but allows Nd4, I'm thinking now Nd4 Rd5 pinning the knight and the knight back to a4 maybe",
        "43. Nd4 Nd5 44. Nxb5+ Kb6 45. Na3 Rh3+ 46. Kg2 Rxc3 47. Nxc4+ Rxc4 48. Rxd5 Re4": "I've had some ideas about: 48...Rh4 49.Rf5 Rxh6 50.Kf3 Rf6+ 51.Rxf6 exf6... but then the white has the outside passed pawn and I don't have enough tempi to defend all white's pawns, as white also is more advanced",
        "49. Rg5": "all forced... now the idea 49...Rxe6 50.Rg7 Rg6+ 51.Rxg6 is even worst for black than that after 48...Rh4 49.Rf5 Rxh6 50.Kf3 Rf6+ 51.Rxf6 exf6"
