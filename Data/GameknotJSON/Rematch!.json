Earlier i said this was the last of 2 games between us. that is not true. shortly following the machine offered a revenge match against me. i eagerly accepted and so far it's getting interesting. Apparently that bishop who  is still alive at the end of this game is wanting a bit more action against the queen and company. {grin} good luck X in game 3. so far 2-0 me. Until next time this is The Warrior signing off"
