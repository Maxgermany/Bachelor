        "1. e4": "Standard e4 opening.",
        "1... Nf6": "Alekhine's Defense.  Really my first mistake, I'm familiar with the Sicilian and that is the direction I should have gone.  Alekhine's is a bit of a pet defense I've been trying to add to my repertoire and that's fine, but here wasn't the place to practice it. ",
        "2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6": "Up to this point I'm still in my comfort zone with this defense.  Until...",
        "4. Nf3": "4. Nf3.  A good response and it put me in a position where I didn't know quite what to do.  I was fully expecting the continuation of 4. c4, my desire to not consult the database is strong but now I'm in deep waters and have no real idea where this is going.  ",
        "4... Bg4": "Knowing that the knight generally comes out a move or two later, this is the move that basically follows that.  Notice that my rating reflects a memorizing of opening theory rather than an understanding of why these moves are played.  I'm sure a vast improvement would follow if I took the time to understand just a few of these things (if I only had the time).  It would not only aide in openings, but also in the movements of the pieces well into middle-game.",
        "5. Be2": "Defending with a piece less powerful than her Queen (Glenda) which also allows the queen to escape the pin anytime she likes.  This also frees up the knight to move as well, which is the direction Joanne takes in her next move.",
        "5... g6": "My first mistake according to the post-game analysis (PGA) which recommended 5. ... e6.",
        "6. Ng5 Bh6": "A blunder.  This game was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what I was thinking, but chances are I got lost in possible variations and forgot the threat at hand to my bishop on g4.",
        "7. Bxg4": "En prise.",
        "7... O-O": "Another mistake... with a heavy force bearing down on the king-side of the board, I castled right into it.  I try not to lose sleep over castling into a hot situation, I've done it before with success.  Here I didn't look far enough into the position.  Maybe nabbing the knight on g5 was better, or maybe developing the queen-side knight was better.  I generally like to have all my intermediate pieces developed before move 10, and there could have been a possibility for a later O-O-O.",
        "8. Ne6 fxe6": "Felt forced.",
        "9. Bxe6+ Kh8 10. Bxh6": "And now there are two very sharp, beady-eyed bishops licking their chops at an almost helpless and paralyzed rook.",
        "10... Nb6": "Why not save the rook?  Well Re8 only delays the inevitable. ",
        "11. Bxf8 Qxf8": "The dismantling of my defense (what defense?) continues...",
        "12. O-O": "An opportunistic castle.",
        "12... Nc6 13. exd6 cxd6": "Capturing to the center of the board to maintain the last shred of security that I have.  A couple of pawns and a queen-rook tandem that are looking for the backdoor to retreat.",
        "14. d5 Ne5 15. b3": "Not sure of the motivation for that move.  It may have been a stalling tactic to force a move to cost me tempo.  It's a bit above my paygrade.",
        "15... Qh6 16. f4 Ned7 17. Qd4+": "I would like my last rites now.",
        "17... Nf6 18. Nd2 Kg7 19. Ne4 Kf8 20. Nxf6 exf6 21. Qxf6+": "Perhaps a blindfold and a cigarette?  No need to worry about the health risks, it'll all be over soon enough.",
        "21... Ke8 22. Rae1": "King is pinned, not much I can do to stave off the inevitable now... ready...",
        "22... Rd8": "aim...",
        "23. Bc8#": "FIRE!  \n\n\nThanks for the game Joanne.  I took away a few lessons and hopefully my zombie king will rise from the dead and take a bite of Glenda's head ;)"
