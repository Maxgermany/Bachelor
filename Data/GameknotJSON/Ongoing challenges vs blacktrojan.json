        "1. e4": "Game note: \u201cI'm 4-1 vs him. My loss was black. He plays uncommon openings. Can't remember what he does vs Sicilian. Let's see...\u201d\n",
        "1... c5 2. Bc4": "Game note: \u201cjust remember somebody else played this opening and I went dragon which may not have been ideal\u201d\n",
        "2... d6 3. d3": "In hindsight I noticed this pins-in his LSB.\n",
        "3... Nf6 4. h3 e6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. g4 Nc6 7. Bb5 O-O 8. Be3": "Game note: \u201c8.Be3 I think Nc3 would have been better because now I have ...d5\u201d  Post analysis shows a clear -0.82 with 8\u2026Qb6 and yes \u2026d5 is also a good option.\n",
        "8... d5 9. e5 Qc7": "I immediately noticed my woops??  9\u2026Nxe5 10.Nxe5 Qa5+ 11.Nd2 Qxb5 would have been great or just the simple \u2026Nd7.\n",
        "10. exf6 gxf6": "Game note: \u201c10...gxf6 is ugly but not sure about ...Bxf6\u201d.  I still wasn\u2019t seeing \u2026Qa5+ was I?\n",
        "11. Bh6": "Game note: \u201c?  11.Bxc5.\u201d\n",
        "11... Re8 12. Kd2 Bf8 13. Bxf8 Rxf8 14. Qe2": "Game note: \u201c12.Kd2 and 14.Qe2 not a clue what he's doing so I'm moving in to snatch his LSB. Around move 18 or so I may need to move my c-pawn out of the way to allow my Q to slide back to the K-side.\u201d  He wasted a big material advantage.\n",
        "14... Qa5+ 15. Nc3 d4 16. Bxc6 bxc6 17. g5 dxc3+ 18. bxc3 c4": "Computer didn\u2019t see this move.  It was looking for an immediate Q retreat to d8 or some resolution of the k-side pawns with 18\u2026fxg5.  Once it analyzes the text move it comes to the same conclusion.  Weird.\n",
        "19. gxf6 Qf5 20. Rag1+ Kh8 21. Rg3": "Game note: \u201c21.Rg3 now I have a few options ...cxd3 ...Qxf6 ...Rf8 ...Rb8 and watch for ...Rd8 if that file opens up. He's got the option to double his R's. I'm only at -1 material so could be worse. Allowing his Q to e3-h6-g7 would be catastrophic.\u201d  By the way 21.Qe5 would have been better, removing one of the only defenders of my K-side.\n",
        "21... cxd3 22. cxd3 Qxf6 23. Qe5": "Game note: \u201c23.Qe5 so he wants a Q trade. I think it\u2019s too late because I still wanna play ...Rb8 but if Nxc6 then ...Bb7 pins his N to his R on h1. Having said that, his e5 N is dangerous on account of Nxf7+ so I'll kick that away first with 26...f6.\u201d\n",
        "23... Qxe5 24. Nxe5 f6 25. Nxc6": "nope",
        "25... Bb7 26. Re1 Bxc6 27. Rxe6 Bd5 28. Ra6 Bh1": "Game note: \u201c28...??? ...Rb8 getting tougher to play. Now thinking ...Bh1 (better central control), ...Rf7, or ...f5 first.\u201d\n",
        "29. c4 Rf7": "I felt it was forced.",
