        "1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4": "The Center Game, a very old-fashioned opening. White either loses time recapturing or has to play a kind of gambit.",
        "3. Nf3 Bc5": "3... N-QB3 seems more natural. ",
        "4. Bc4 Nc6 5. c3": "Definitely a gambit now, as White offers the Pawn exchange locking in Black's material gain in return for a quick, provocative attack.",
        "5... dxc3": "Black is a man of honor: he must accept the gambit.",

        "11. Re1 Qg6 12. Qb3 Nf6 13. Nc3": "White is down a Pawn, but Black's exposed K position and immobile KR are weaknesses. It's hard to tell who has the advantage.",
        "13... h6 14. Be3 Bg4": "Both men complete their development, clearing the last minor pieces off the first rank.",
        "15. Nh4 Qh5 16. Qxb7": "Black had overlooked this fork, which wins a piece and gives White the material edge... momentarily.",
        "16... Rb8 17. Qxc6": "White thinks he's just won a piece, but he in turn had overlooked...",
        "17... Qxh4": "...this capture.",
        "18. Qxc7 Rxb2": "In his eagerness to snatch back the Pawn, Black leaves his first rank undefended.",
        "19. Qc8+ Kf7 20. Qxh8": "White pounces, winning the Rook. In turn, he has to be careful not to get his Q trapped on the 8th rank.",
