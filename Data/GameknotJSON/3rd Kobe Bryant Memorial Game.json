        "1. e4 c5 2. g3 Nc6 3. Bg2 g6 4. c3": "Sicilian, Alapin's Variation (2.c3)  I play Sicilian alot, but I rarely see this opening.  To me, this seems like a too passive approach for myself... so I did not look forward to this game",
        "4... Bg7 5. Ne2 e5 6. b3 Nf6 7. Qc2 O-O 8. Ba3 b6 9. d3 Bb7 10. Nd2 Ng4": "Probably my lowest point in this game.  I thought that he'd have to ruin his pretty king side structure to defend against this piece (I was thinking 11. h3), but apparently that was not the case",
        "11. Bh3": "The wise counter from my able opponent",
        "11... Nf6 12. d4 d6": "Similarly I felt nervous at this point... I need to learn how to deal with backwards pawns in the middle.  Or atleast I should atleast remember to avoid them.",
        "13. g4 Re8 14. d5": "Another low point, I was sure that he'd win at this point with a safe advanced pawn.  Castle queen side, advance the C and F pawn to destroy my interior and I would be screwed.",
        "14... Ne7 15. f3": "Another reason why you don't advance the f pawn before you are secure.  His e pawn was well defended by 2 pieces and was at no risk.  ",
        "15... Nexd5": "A questionable sacrifice.  However, given my situation I thought 2 center pawns were adequate booty for a badly placed knight",
        "16. exd5 Nxd5 17. Qd3": "The fatal mistake",
        "17... Qh4+ 18. Kd1 Qxh3 19. Nc4": "The next few moves I am very proud of because I contemplated them deeply.  It seemed like in every option I was up; however it was a very precarious situation.  ",
        "19... Qg2 20. Kd2 Bh6+ 21. Kc2 Nf4 22. Rag1 Qxe2+ 23. Qxe2 Nxe2": "Gaining a knight for free while destroying his structure and setting up possible retaliatory attacks in the center.  ",
        "24. Rge1 Rad8 25. b4 Bxf3 26. Rhf1": "At this point he resigned due to the obvious 26... Bg4 which would have secured me at a 7 piece advantage with a weak, but sufficient, pawn structure and support.  I would like to thank Alin for putting on a great game and having the better of me for most of the game."
