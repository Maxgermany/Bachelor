        "1. e4": "This is a rather one-sided affair, but there is a nice finish!",
        "1... e5": "Out for blood, I opened e4",
        "2. Nf3 d6": "perfectly playable, but Nc6 is more common",
        "3. d4 exd4": "Giving up the centre is not recommended, but playable",
        "4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6 6. Bc4": "I thought he may play g6 here (or a move or two earlier) to transpose into a modern defence.",
        "6... Qe7": "Be7 is better",
        "7. O-O": "Of course he can't take on e4 because of Re1",
        "7... Bg4": "This loses time",
        "8. f3 Bd7 9. Nd5 Nxd5 10. exd5 Ne5 11. Re1": "he is now losing a piece",
        "11... Qh4 12. f4 O-O-O 13. fxe5 Bg4": "But he has a bit of an attack for the material lose",
        "14. Be2 h5": "Interesting! I was expecting him to exchange bishops, but this is probably stronger",
        "15. h3 Bxh3": "Bravo! I wasn't expecting this, but it is clearly black's best hope",
        "16. gxh3 Qg3+": "Again, we played, much better to force the win of the h pawn with this check, rather than take the h pawn immediately",
        "17. Kf1 Qxh3+ 18. Kf2 dxe5": "I was slightly worried here. My king is exposed and he seems to have 4 connected passed pawns for two pieces. I could even be losing, if I gave him time to mobilise them",
        "19. Rh1 Qd7 20. Nb5 Be7 21. Nxa7+": "One pawn back!",
        "21... Kb8 22. Be3 g5 23. Rxh5": "another pawn drops!",

        "26. Bg4 Qe4": "OK, white to play and win!!!",
        "27. Nc6+": "A nice sac to round the game off. It is soon mate now, whatever black plays.",
