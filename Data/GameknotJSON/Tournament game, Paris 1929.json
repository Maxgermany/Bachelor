        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4": "Colle opposes Menchik's QP opening with a Nimzo-Indian Defense.",
        "4. e3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 b6": "Having exchanged away one Bishop, Colle prepares to fianchetto his other one.",
        "6. Bd3 Bb7 7. Nf3 Ne4": "Colle plants his Knight on a powerful central outpost.",
        "8. Qc2 f5 9. O-O O-O": "With both players castled, the middle-game phase begins. Znosko-Borovsky, in his classic work \"The Middle Game In Chess\", declares that these kind of positions, where the opening is transitioning into the middle-game proper, are the most difficult to handle correctly even for grandmasters, let alone run-of-the-mill players.",
        "10. Nd2 Qh4 11. f3 Nf6": "The Knight is finally forced to retreat, although 11... NxN was also feasable. However, conceding the Bishop-pair is probably not a wise move at this stage.",
        "12. Rb1 Nc6 13. Qd1 Kh8": "Tucking the King in a more secure spot, away from the potentially dangerous diagonal running from Black's KN1 to his QR7.",
        "14. Qe1 Qh5 15. Qg3 d6": "Blocking the Queen's attack, but at the cost of weakening the now backward KP.",
        "16. Ba3 Rfe8 17. c5 Qh6": "Colle is beginning to adopt a more defensive posture. ",
        "18. Qf2 dxc5 19. Bxc5 Nd5": "Recentralizing his Knight, hoping to use it as a bulwark against any potential Menchik attack.",
        "20. Ba3 Nxe3 21. Rfe1 Nd5": "Having won a Pawn, the Knight returns to its post. However, the gain comes at the cost of opening an avenue of attack against the weak, backward KP.",
        "22. c4 Nf4 23. Bf1 Nxd4": "Colle picks up a second Pawn. The Knight is apparently hanging, but Colle can win Menchik's Knight on Q2 in return.",
        "24. Qxd4 Rad8 25. Qe3 Rxd2": "Menchik cannot take the Rook [26 QxR?? N-R6 ch 27 PxN QxQ], but she does have a nice tactical trick up her sleeve.",
        "26. Bc1 Red8 27. Bxd2 Rxd2": "Menchik has equalized the material, now ahead an Exchange but behind by 2 Pawns. Colle could not move the Rook out of danger on move 26 because of 27 QxN winning a whole piece.",
        "28. Kh1 Rxa2 29. Rbd1 Kg8": "In return for giving up her QRP, Menchik now controls the only fully open file. However, Colle has the first passed Pawn of the game.",
        "30. Rd8+ Kf7 31. Rd7+ Kg6": "Colle's King seeks shelter in the clutter of K-side Pawns.",
        "32. Rxc7 Qg5 33. Qe5 Kh6": "Menchik slowly begins closing on Colle's King.",
        "34. Rxg7 Qxg7 35. Qxf4+ Kh5": "By sacrificing her Rook, Menchik has opened up the area around Colle's King. ",

        "38. Qf4+ Kh5 39. Re5+": "Colle resigns. After 39... R-N4 40 Q-N4 ch K-R3 41 Q-R4 ch K-N3 42 RxR ch K-B2 43 RxQ ch, Black has nothing left to play for."
