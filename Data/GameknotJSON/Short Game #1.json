        "1... c5 2. Nc3": "Black makes it a Sicilian, and I try transposing a move or two to throw him off. 2. Nf3 is by far the more common move here.",
        "2... Nc6 3. Nf3": "Transposing toward the Open Sicilian.",
        "3... e6 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4": "Fully transposed, now we're pretty much in a Taimanov Variation. one option for black would be to play 5. d6 next and cement his small center firmly in the Scheveningen line too.",
        "5... Qc7 6. Be3 a6 7. Be2 Nf6 8. O-O": "The Paulsen Line of the Taimanov. All pretty standard so far, but here's where my reference ends.",
        "8... Bb4 9. Na4 Bd6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. f4": "This seems to lose the e4 pawn. I found this continuation in GameKnot DB and it looked intriguiging, so I played 11. f4 to see where it will lead: 11. f4 Nxe4 12. Bb6 Qb8 13. Qd4 Nf6 14. Rad1 Be7 15. Bc5 Bxc5 16. Nxc5 O-O 17.

        "13... Nf6 14. Rad1 Bc7 15. Bc5": "Black deviated from my prepared line (didn't he know there was a script for him to follow?) but I follow along a little longer. However, this is when black timed out, as I said earlier, right when it was getting interesting. 39 days for 14 1/2 moves - this game could have gone on for months..."
