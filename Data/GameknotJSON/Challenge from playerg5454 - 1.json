        "1. d4": "Traditional opening move, takes the center.\n",
        "1... Nf6": "1. . .  Nf6 signals an Indian defense. Per Wikipedia,  \"Indian defenses have been the most popular Black replies to 1.d4 because they offer an unbalanced game with chances for both sides. The usual White second move is 2.c4, grabbing a larger share of the center and allowing the move Nc3, to prepare for moving the e-pawn to e4 without blocking the c-pawn.\"\n\nMy comment to White:   I usually consult two resources at this point. The \"Game DB\" below, and 365chess.com to look at typical choices made.",
        "2. c4": "2 c4 is the most frequent move here, preparing for Nc3, influencing the center, preparing for e4.\n\nThe most frequent responses are e6, g6 and c5. \n\ne6 frees my King's bishop and leads to many other Indian games.  g6 prepares the fianchetto of my King's bishop and perhaps the aggressive King's Indian.  c5 is the Benoni and promises an immediate fight for the center. Risky for Black, and not much used in top grandmaster play.",
        "2... e6": "me: Now, tell me, per the Game DB function and the \"World\" database, what are the three most frequent responses at this point?\n\njt7744: Nc3, Nf3 and g3 is the three most frequent responses at this point but Bf4 has a higher % of wining for white\n\nme: Yes, you're right on the three most frequent responses. But Bf4 was played in just six games. Anything can happen in just a small sample. I wouldn't rely on it.",
        "3. Bf4": "Now I can imagine . . . c5; 4 d5 d6; and 5 Qa4+, Qd7; 6 Qxd7+, Bxd7, or 5 Nc3, e5; 6 Bd2, Be7; 7 e4, O-O; 8 Nf3, Na6\n\nTo its credit White's Queen Bishop is developed and sweeps from the center, but I will knock him back with an eventual e5, and he loses time escaping to d2.\n\nOr from the World database, . . . c5, 4 e3, Qb6; % Qb3, Qx b3; 6 axb3, Nc6; 7 Nf3, Nh5 attacking the Bishop.  The computer analysis suggests: 3. Nc3 Bb4.",
        "3... Bb4+": "I develop my Bishop with tempo",
        "4. Nc3": "Nice.  Developes your Knight and parries the Check.",
        "4... c5": "c5 to attack the Center\n\nme: So now the database is not so helpful as there are few games available, though we can at east look at the moves others have made.\nme: So do you take? Or not? The principle here is whether there is a tactical advantage to take. If not, you lose your d pawn to the flank, and miss an opportunity to develop your pieces.",
        "5. a3": "a3?\n\nme: So, if Bxc3, bxc3, Qa5, then Bd2, and I am better developed and you've got doubled up pawns. I prefer Black's position.\nme: If I were White, instead of a3, I'd prefer Nf3, developing a piece and protecting d4.",
        "5... Bxc3+": "Bishop takes rather than retreating and hiding at b6.  Black will have more pieces developed, be ready to castle, and not have doubled pawns.",
        "6. bxc3 Qa5": "Developing my Queen, threatening Qxc3+.",
        "7. dxc5": "No Bd2?\n\nOh no!  Triple isolated pawns!  How will White defend these long term?\n\nme: What if Qxc3+, Bd2; Qxc4?\nme: Or Nc6 and I develop and attack the isolated pawns later?\n\nNc6 would support e5, pushing back your Bishop while I develop and take the center.  The computer suggests: 7. Bd2 O-O 8. Nf3 b6 9. e3 Bb7 10. Bd3 Be4 11. Bxe4 Nxe4 12. O-O Nc6 13. d5 Nxd2 14. Qxd2",
        "7... Nc6 8. Nf3": "me: Nf3 develops a piece.\nme: Prevents e5? Not really. e5, Nxe5; Qxc3+. If Bishop takes, Knight takes and Q x c3+, taking Rook.",
        "8... Qxc3+": "me: You're really forced to Bd2. Do you see why?\nme: Then I take your pawn at c4. How do you threaten me then?",
        "9. Bd2": "Bd2, not Qd2, or I take the rook at a1.",
        "9... Qxc4": "I grab a pawn, but I won't be able to stay here for long.",
        "10. Rc1": "Rc1 is good, threatens the Queen, protects th c pawn, though it will eventually go away, ideally in an exchange at b6 or d6.",
        "10... Qd5": "Nowhere better to go.",
        "11. e3": "Yes! e3 opens a \"hole\" for the King's Bishop and aims at the center.",
        "11... O-O": "Black castles.  Black has a good game, more than equalized. Pawns are connected, knights developed, and the Queen is in the center but not in a stable spot.  Black's Queen Bishop is locked in and must be freed, probably with b6 or d6.\n\nWhite needs to develop, probably with Be2 or Qc2.  I favor Be2, so that White can castle.\n\nHow about Bc4?  Black would then take the c-pawn.  But, what if White then takes the e pawn, exposing Black's Queen to the rook at c1?  Well, Black could grab the pawn at a3, and still be a pawn ahead.  Maybe better, if White is thinking so aggressively, is to prepare with Qa4.\n\n",
        "12. Bb4": "Hmmm. A surprise move.  NxB seems, at first, to yield a disadvantage, connecting White's pawns.  But that will quickly change with b6.  White offers an exchange of Queens, with my Knight at the center.  With a lower rated opponent, I would like to keep my Queen.  Still, I feel I must accept this.\n\nh5 does not create a lasting advantage: White exchanges Queens at the next move.",
        "12... Nxb4 13. axb4": "White has connected his pawns, . . . for now.  But soon Black's a pawn will be on the march.",

        "14. Bc4": "Forcing a Queen exchange.",
        "14... Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1": "Rook takes.  But it could also have been the King, preparing for the endgame.",
        "15... bxc5 16. bxc5 Bb7": "Finally the Bishop is in play, aimed at the center, and maybe taking the Knight to double White's pawns.",
        "17. Bb5": "Threatening my d pawn.\n\nBut my Rook on f can take White's c pawn, and soon march the a pawn, protected by the Rook on the a file. Rfc8; 18 Bxd7, Rxc5; 19 O-O, a5; 20 Ba4, Bxf3, 21 gxf3, Nd5. ",
        "17... Rfc8": "To take the c pawn",
        "18. Rc1": "Hmmm.  The plan to capture the c pawn is thwarted.  I can make the Bishop run with a6.  I can double White's pawns with BxNf3.\n\nOr ...Rab8; c6, Bxc6; Bxc6, Rxc6; Rxc6, dxc6' O-O, c5",
        "18... Bxf3": "I create doubled pawns for him.",
        "19. gxf3 Rc7": "Protecting, again, my d pawn and threatening to double rooks, to take his c pawn.",

        "21. Rfd1": "Attacking my d pawn.",
        "21... Rb8": "Per Nimzowitsch I seize the open file.",
        "22. Ba6 Rb2": "And get to the second rank, which is usually uncomfortable for the opponent.",
        "23. e4": "e4 enables me to stop his doubled f pawns by getting my Knight at the outpost on f4. Better for White to deploy his Bishop more productively (and get out of the way of its rook), perhaps at d3 or f1.  Then get its rook to c4, to move an eventual h4 and take Black's gxh4 with the Rook. White's other rook could go to a1 to threaten Black's a pawn.",
        "23... Nh5": "Looking for a central outpost for my Knight on f4. Maybe R to a2 would have been better, moving it eventually to a5 to attack White's c pawn.",
        "24. Rcb1": "Offering to exchange. Bf1 would be better, moving the rook to a1 or the other to d6.\n\n I have nothing better and I will win the c pawn.",
        "24... Rxb1 25. Rxb1 Rxc5": "Winning the pawn.",
        "26. Rb7": "He's read about going to the seventh rank, too.  But -- oops! -- he doesn't see the danger to his King. Better would have been Kg2. Then Nf4+, and Kg3.",
