        "8. exd6": "Now having the advantage of moving the knight to c7 with taking another pawn and further attacking both Black King and the Rook at a8. Then the best option would be get rid of the pawn. Then Bishop at c4 can be moved into a safer place like b3, d3 etc.",
        "8... Bxd6 9. Bb3 Ne7 10. O-O O-O": "Hoping to move knight to square f6, a fork .. better bishop move and get rid of h pawn, then if g pawn can cut the bishop and I'll get what I desired.",
