        "3. Nc3 Nc6 4. Nf3": "This is pretty standard. Black could play Nxe4 here. The most standard move is Bc5 here. H6 is possible too.",
        "4... d6": "This move isn't really standard, but it's not really that bad. However after Ng5 black should play d5, so this may be counted as losing a tempo.",
        "5. Ng5": "Here I go trying to get some fun. d5 is pretty standard here but black had a surprising move that lost immediately.",
        "5... Ng4": "This move looks ok, but it is not! Nxf7 looks good, probably Qf6 will follow and there will probably be some material loss for black. However there is a better move.",
