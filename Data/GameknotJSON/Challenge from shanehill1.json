        "1. e4": "This was actually a fun game to play.  There are moments when I sweated.  Here, white opens with a king pawn opening.",
        "1... e5": "I responded in kind. ",
        "2. Qf3 Nf6 3. Bc4 Bc5": "As you can see, he brought out his queen early in the game. White is at a disadvantage, but he has beaten me in the past by bringing out his queen early.",
        "4. c3 O-O 5. Qh3 d6 6. g4 Bxg4 7. Qh4 Qd7 8. h3": "I did take a pawn, but I blundered here -- or you can say, I \"sacrificed a piece.",
        "8... Bf3": "I did take a pawn, but I blundered here -- or you can say, I \"sacrificed\" a piece. I wasn't going to trade my Queen for a pawn, but that wasn't in my thoughts. I wanted to trap the King and the Knight took my bishop.",
        "9. Nxf3 Nc6 10. Bf1 d5 11. exd5": "Here, I deliberately sacrificed a pawn to prepare an Alekhine Gun. The idea is to open a file for the use of your rooks. ",
        "11... Qxd5 12. Ng5 Rad8 13. Bg2 Qxg2 14. Rf1": "I had to keep my knight back to guard my h7 pawn.  The threat of Checkmate is very, very real.",
        "14... Rd3 15. a3 Rfd8 16. b4 Bxf2+ 17. Rxf2 Qg1+ 18. Ke2 Qxc1 19. Nf3": "Here, I've got my gun and I'm getting rid of some problem pieces.  Most notably parts of his army that hasn't been deployed.",
        "19... Qb2 20. Ng5 Qxa1 21. Rxf6 Qxb1 22. Rxf7 Rd3xd2+": "I didn't take his rook because it would have been a distraction. ",
        "23. Kf3 Qd3+ 24. Kg4 h6 25. Re7 Nxe7 26. Ne6": "With his knight out of the way, the threat of Checkmate is somewhat stopped. So I am focusing on Checkmate myself.\n",
        "26... Rg2+": "And this is where he resigned.  There was one place where his king could go, and I had full control of the game. "
