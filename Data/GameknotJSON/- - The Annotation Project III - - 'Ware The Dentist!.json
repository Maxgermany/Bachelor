        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI have joined the Annotations Project Part 3 Mini-tournament and I am trying to avoid stepping on the mines playing the black pieces.  Yup, black is Q for 2 pieces up but the minor pieces, e.g. the knights and bishops are everywhere so it is a minefield for the BK and BQ.  Now, my buddy Thom Pham (tofuman) who is a Dentist has bravely joined this tournament.  Although he currently has a Class D rating, he has an optimum rating of 1407 so underestimate him at your peril lest he drill a terrific cavity in your rating and give you a massive toothache!  I thought I would annotate this game because he is due to be my opponent and I do not wish to incur my second loss against him so I need to learn something from it to be prepared.   Freddy, the Master Mater has used the Caro-Kann Defence to build up to the traditional Queen Sac.  The Caro-Kann is 1. ..... c6 in response to 1. e4, preparing a move like d5.  I will comment further on the action after white's 9th move.   You can follow the game move by move by referring to the Gameknot Analysis version of this game as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14257584&rnd=0.7276568196264748",
        "1... c6 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Kb6": "9. ..... Kb6 - black moves his king out of the way of a Royal Fork on e6.",
        "10. Nf7": "10. Nf7 - hmm, this actually breaks the rule of Do Not Cash In Too Soon.  It may redress the material balance but it wastes tempi.",
        "10... Qd5 11. Nxh8": "11. Nxh8 - nacht but see my earlier note.",
        "11... e5 12. Nc3 Qd4 13. f5 Bc5": "13. ...... Bc5 - black threatens Qf2+.",
        "14. Rf1 Nd7 15. Nf7": "15. Nf7 - Thom extricates his knight from h8 but is he wasting time?  He does have a 2 point material advantage though.",
        "15... Nf6 16. Be2 Rf8": "16. ..... Rf8 - black looks OK here, he is fully developed and just needs to play a move like Kc7 and then try and take advantage of white's lack of development - he still needs to move out his c1 bishop to prepare castling long.",
        "17. Ng5 h6": "17. ...... h6 - instead black decided to chase Thom's knight around.  Aha, I see that after Ng5 Kc7 is not possible because of a Royal Fork on e6!",
        "18. Ne6 Qd6 19. Nxf8 Qxf8": "19. ....... Qxf8 - Thom is now 4 points up in material.",
        "20. Na4+ Ka5": "20. ..... Ka5? - I do not like this move as Kc7 IS now possible.  I fear that for the BK things are gonna get really horrible.  I feel it is far too early for the king to come out into the middle of the board unless forced to do so, do you the jury agree?",
        "21. b3 b5 22. Nxc5 Qxc5": "22. ...... Qxc5 - one set of minor pieces has been exchanged but white still has sufficent material to mate and look at how the Royal black couple are standing - they are sitting ducks for a pawn fork!",
        "23. a3 Nd5": "23...... Nd5? - this move is a mistake - please see Gameknot Analysis in my intro note.  I can see even before glancing at Gameknot Analysis that this move is a massive blunder because black is gonna drop his queen to a pawn fork, ouch and double ouch!",
        "24. b4+ Nxb4 25. axb4+ Kxb4": "25. ...... Kxb4 - It seems as though he has given up his knight to save his queen, but, now comes a royal skewer from Thom's dark square bishop which finally develops on move 25 to devastating effect ...... for black ....",
        "26. Ba3+ Ka5 27. Bxc5#": "27. Bxc5 MATE!! - the Royal couple perish together and The Dentist (Well played there Thom) has his day."
