        "7. Qd2 O-O 8. O-O-O Nc6 9. f3 Re8 10. g4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 h6": "?! Generally, no one wants to create a contact point for the opponent's pawn storm. \nProbably, he should have tried to create some counterplay on the queenside, because in those positions he can only hope to defend.",
        "12. h4 Nh7 13. Nd5": "! A quite surprising move, because it stops the most annoying move on Black side: Bf6.",
        "13... Bf8": "Contrary to the first impression, Bxh4 doesn't gain material, because of Rxh4 and Nxc7, then the d6 pawn falls.",
        "14. Qd2 Nf6 15. Nxf6+": "! Gaining a tempo for the opening of the kingside lines with g5.",
        "15... Qxf6 16. g5 hxg5 17. hxg5 Qg6 18. Bd3 f5": "It blocks e5, but it allows a quite nice tactic, that I managed to spot after almost half an hour of analysis at the board.",
        "19. Bc4+ Be6 20. exf5 Qxf5 21. Bd3": "! The move probably missed, because it is always easy to miss retreating moves. Now the King is open and the conclusion is near.",
        "21... Qc5 22. Bg6 Bf5": "? The better Be7 would have delayed the checkmate by 10 moves or more, but this is just suicidal.",
        "23. Rh8+": "! Mate in 3, so resignation is perfectly sound."
