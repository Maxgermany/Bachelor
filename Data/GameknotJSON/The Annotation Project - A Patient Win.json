        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nIt was a great day for me, firstly in the cricket the Ozzys were well and truly Freddied by Flintoff, secondly I was very pleased to have brought this match to a satisfying winning conclusion.  It meant I have now got 9 points out of my 12 completed games in this tournament.  I have done the double over my buddy Bob and I briefly held on to a rating of 1800 (the first time I got to that milestone in my entire chessic career), achieved yesterday after Bob waved the white flag.  Unfortunately I could not hold on to that rating because I lost a game to john_wr in another mini-tournament.  That game will be annotated straight after this one, but now on to the action which starts on move 10 when I play 10. Nc3 - essential to get pieces out quickly, especially when facing a 3 point or more deficit.",
        "1... c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Qxg4 Nxg4 7. Bxf7+ Kd7 8. Be6+ Kc7 9. Bxg4 Kb6 10. Nc3": "10. Nc3 - see previous note.",
        "10... a6 11. Nf7": "11. Nf7 - I decide that as I am almost developed this is the right time to execute the knight fork - after that at least I will pull level.",
        "11... Qd4 12. Nxh8 e5 13. b3": "13. b3 - preparing to move Fou Lenoir to b2 in order to line up a nasty discovery on the a1-h8 diagonal as the Wicked Witch of the West is sitting on it!",
        "13... Ka7 14. Bb2": "14. Bb2 - Bob tucked his king safely out of the way but I move Fou Lenoir to this square anyway because it is a developing move and I have the choice of where to put Henry.",
        "14... Qd8 15. O-O-O": "15. 0-0-0 - as I will be lining up a rook on the same file as the Witch, queenside I choose that!",
        "15... Nc6 16. Nf7": "16. Nf7 - now I extricate my knight.  At least I have now completed my development and amazingly points are NOT level - in fact I have a PLUS score of 2, no Glenda but a plus score of 2, nice.",
        "16... Qf6 17. Nxe5 Nxe5": "17. ....... Nxe5 - knight trade - at least I can now swap off my trapped knight and still maintain +2 because if Qxd5?? in response to 18. fxe5 then the BK can still get caught in a discovery on that a1-h8 diagonal.  Bob sees this and avoids the poisoned pawn like the plague and sends his Witch on her broomstick to c6.",
        "18. fxe5 Qc6 19. Rhe1": "19. Rhe1 - time to centralise that rook me hearties!  I have got a plan up my sleeve concerning that e5 pawn.  Later on that little foot soldier, as Blake would say, will become a footman in drag, a pretender to Glenda!  That is still a long long way away though.",
        "19... Re8 20. Rxe4": "20. Rxe4 - capturing the black e4 pawn and defending my own e5 passer at the same time.  Yup, already that passer is becoming a worry to Bob.",
        "20... g6 21. Rde1": "21. Rde1 - additional protection to that one little footman.",
        "21... Bh6": "21 ....... Bh6 - a pin that could become nasty.",
        "22. Nb1": "22. Nb1 - defends the pinned pawn on d2, opens up a protective line on e5 from Fou Lenoir and Glenda's steed also stops that Witch from invading on a3.",
        "22... Rd8 23. Re4e2": "23. Re4e2 - drops back to maintain protection on the e5 pawn and to add more protection to the pinned d2 pawn.",
        "23... Bg5 24. e6": "24. e6 - suddenly that e pawn is just 2 squares away from Glendadom!",
        "24... Be7 25. Bf3": "25. Bf3 - attacking the Witch and consolidating my kingside.",
        "25... Qb6 26. Re2e4": "26. Re4 - to stop a move like c5 breaking up the pawn position around Henry.  That Witch still has too many helpers to rule out a queenside mating attack on the weakened position.  I also need to watch out for an eventual Qf2.  Thankfully that never materialises.",
        "26... g5 27. g3": "27. g3 - consolidation.",
        "27... h6 28. Bh5": "28. Bh5 - at last my opponent gives me an opportunity to formulate a plan to get that pawn to Glendadom.  Fou Leblanc will firstly defend it on f7 releasing the white rooks to create mayhem somewhere else.",
        "28... Qa5 29. Ra4 Qb6 30. Bf7": "30. Bf7 - as planned.",
        "30... Rd6 31. Rae4 Qd8 32. h4": "32. h4 - I now see another plan - swap off the dsbs.",
        "32... gxh4 33. gxh4": "33. gxh4 - first up a pawn trade.",
        "33... b6 34. Bg7": "34. Bg7 - Fou Lenoir emerges from the corner to attack the isolani on h6 - it cannot be saved so I will at least increase my material advantage to +5, the equivalent of a whole rook.",
        "34... Kb7 35. Bxh6 Kc6 36. Bg5 Bxg5 37. hxg5": "37. hxg5 - bishop trade accomplished.",
        "37... Qe7": "37. ...... Qe7 - the Witch blockades but I am not to be thwarted, I have another foot soldier that can wear Glenda's dress and white long pointed hat with a tiara round the brim and hold her sceptre cum wand!",
        "38. g6 Rd5 39. g7 Rg5 40. g8=Q": "40. g8/Q - Voila, here is Drag Queen No.1!",
        "40... Rxg8 41. Bxg8": "41. Bxg8 - Glenda disappears but Bob had to give up his rook for her.",
        "41... Kd6 42. Rf4": "42. Rf4 - preparing the Witch Ejection move Rf7.",
        "42... Qg7 43. e7": "43. e7 - will this be the clincher?",
        "43... Qg3 44. e8=Q": "44. e8/Q - not quite but the second pretender to Glenda appears in her gear!",
        "44... Qxf4": "44. ..... Qxf4 - the Witch takes my rook but I am not to be denied, here comes the final crusher .......",
        "45. Qb8+": "45. Qb8 - a nice royal skewer seals the win and my 1800 rating.  Again, pity I could not hold on to it and I have a few more dodgy games in my profile to contend with.  But I will take whatever setbacks that come in my stride and learn from them (for a starters from the lost game that I will be annotating soon) and hopefully get back up to 1800 again.  Have a nice day and bye for now!  Joanne"
