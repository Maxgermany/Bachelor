Black can do two things: c5, and get countergame on the queenside, or try to castle queenside, instead. Black didn't make the mistake of Nc6 before c5, but castled kingside. This makes it a perfect target for me. It would be exaggerated to say that white has an edge, but black has to play with more care that it seems. ",
        "6... a6": "? Just one carelessly slow move. Probably it has a plan of b5-Bb7, but... ",
        "7. g4": "Here it comes. Cesar crossed the Rubicone. ",
        "7... Nc6": "Almost useless move. The Nd5 can't be taken by the other N. Nb4 is hardly an annoyance. Black plans to answer Nd7 to g5?",
        "8. g5": "Nd7 forces me to find a way to proceed, and I have plenty of them, but it would be hard to find a definitive winning one. But black preferred...",
        "8... Ne4": "My Nd2 has only one scope in this opening: to be exchanged with this black N. ",
        "9. Bd3": "Black is helping, but not all is still done. This move threatens him a pawn. But, more than that, is x-raying h7. ",
        "9... Nxg5": "?? The losing mistake. f5 was needed, or even Qh4, and the fight continues.  But now, nothing can save black. ",
        "10. Qh5": "A piece is lost... or more. ",
        "10... h6": "Opening a square for his N to retire, but...",
        "11. Rg1": "If now black plays 15... f6, 16... BxN. Bxh6 is threatened, so fxB seems the only reasonable option. After it, 17. Ng5 seems to offer white with Nxh6, winning, for example: Be7, 18. Nxh6+, gxN, 19. Qg6+! and mate on h7 the next move. ",
        "11... Nxe5": "BxN, dxB, Ne7 was another idea. ",
        "12. dxe5": "The unconfortable Bd6 pays the price of his outcome (it could have been in e7, and black would stand a little better). ",
        "12... g6": "Ok now. Playing against a 1900+ deserves something more interesting than the boring Qxh6. ",
        "13. Bxg6": "Coup de gr\u00e2ce. ",
        "13... fxg6 14. Qxg6+ Kh8 15. Qxh6+": "And black resigns. It's not only hanging two minor pieces with almost no action, but he's facing a dreadful discovered check after BxN. A good lesson about how very slight careless moves can lead you right into the hell against a London :-D"
