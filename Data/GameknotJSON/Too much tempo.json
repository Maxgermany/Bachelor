        "2... Bc5": "? Bad move right at the start. There's no point to lose that pawn, black have no good way to create an attack.",
        "3. Nxe5": "Taking the pawn, wondering what is his plan. Qh4 would be probably countered by Qf3.",

        "4. Kxf2 Qh4+ 5. g3": "There was not any good place to move the king. In the long term, my pawn structure would give nice possibilities for black to attack me, but with this move, I was so much ahead in development and black position was so bad that I didn't care a bit. Black must not lose any tempo to gain some advantage of this position, thing that is almost impossible now that the queen is on the middle of the field.",
