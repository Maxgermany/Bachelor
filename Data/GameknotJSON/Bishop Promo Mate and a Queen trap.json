        "3... dxe4": "In truth, this was a risky gambit. The passed pawn has the potential to cause much grief later on.",
        "4. Nd2": "Better than Nc3, which can be pinned. I plan on pulling the pawn closer to the jaws of death.",
        "4... Nf6 5. g4": "Gonna chase his Knight.",
        "5... e3": "I had planned on playing Ne4 here, but that is impossible now.",

        "6... Nd5": "If I would have been thinking, I would have traded for the pawn.",
        "7. Bg2 Nxf4 8. Bf3 Qh4+": "I thought I was in trouble, but after closer inspection, I found there wasn't too much to fear.",

        "17. h4 Be7 18. g5 f6": "Discovered checks are nasty, but this one is quite benign.",

        "31... Nf3+": "He bites!",
        "32. Nxf3": "Taking with the Rook is not a good option.",
