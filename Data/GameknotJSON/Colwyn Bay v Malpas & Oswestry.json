    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "After going through a bad patch - losing 2 and drawing one of my last 3 games - I finally get back to winning ways!",
        "1... Nf6": "The match was played in a handicapped knock-out. If we drew 3-3 against our opponents we would go out. I knew I had one of the most favourable ratings difference against my opponent. http://www.cdchessleague.org.uk/results.php?comp=Knock+Out",
        "2. c4": "I was not expecting my opponent - he doesn't normally play board 3, their normal board 2 was missing.",
        "2... d5": "Transposing into the Queen's Gambit Declined, Marshall Defence. I don't think it is very good, it give white a strong centre. It scores well for white.",
        "3. cxd5": "The recommended move.",
        "3... Nxd5": "The most common reply. 3...Qxd5 scores even worse. It allows white to attack the black queen with 4. Nc3.",
        "4. e4": "I seize the centre.",
        "4... Nb6": "At the time I thought this was a mistake and that Nf56 was better, but now I see in the opening databases that both moves score about equally badly.",
        "5. Nc3": "The natural square for my knight.",
        "5... e6": "5....g6 and transposing into an unfavourable variation of the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence scores better than this move.",
        "6. Be3": "Played to prevent c7-c5.",
        "6... Be7": "This move doesn't score very well - but neither does anything else!",
        "7. Qd2": "7. Nf3 is the normal move here. As I said, I was playing for a win and had planned 0-0-0. 7. Qd2 is not in any of the opening database I have access to.",
        "7... c6": "A bit passive, and leaving his d6 square weak.",
        "8. O-O-O": "So I castle.",
        "8... Nb8d7": "He develops.",
        "9. Nf3": "I have a plan of Bg5 and exchanging dark squared bishops followed by e4-e5 and Nc3-e4-d6",
        "9... Nf6": "Continuing with his development.",
        "10. Bd3": "and me with mine.",
        "10... h6": "He stops my plan.",
        "11. h3": "With the idea of g2-g4-g5",
        "11... Bb4": "At last some sort of attacking move by black. The threat is Nb6-a4 and Qd8-a5.",
        "12. Qc2": "So I decide to stop that.",
        "12... Bd7": "He develops again.",
        "13. g4": "I continue with my attack.",
        "13... Rc8": "He mobilises his rook.",
        "14. g5": "and I continue with my plans.",
        "14... hxg5": "He takes.",
        "15. Bxg5": "I take back, threatening e4-e5.",
        "15... Be7": "I think this is a mistake. Qd8-c7 seems better to me.",
        "16. e5": "So I continue with my plan.",
        "16... Nfd5": "Knight immediately goes to the strong square on d5.",
        "17. Bxe7": "I take.",
        "17... Qxe7": "I think this is a mistake, and he should have taken back with the knight, so that he can meet Nc3-e4 with Ne7-f5.",
        "18. Ne4": "Now he is in real trouble.",
        "18... Nb4": "Probably best, exchanging off my bishop for his knight.",
        "19. Qb3": "So the queen moves.",
        "19... Nxd3+": "He takes with check.",
        "20. Rxd3": "I take back.",
        "20... Rc7": "So that if I check on d6, my knight is not attacking his rook. What would you play now dear reader? To check or not?",
        "21. Kb1": "At the time I was proud of this move - calmly moving the king to a safer square before proceeding. I figures after 21. Nd6+ Kf8 he would be threatening to free his position with c6-c5. Fritz actually gives Rg1 as the best move, and Nd6+ as the second best move.",
        "21... Nc8": "He stops my knight coming in, but it is amazingly passive. Fritz prefers Kf8 or Nd5.",
        "22. Nfd2": "I was quite proud of this move too - threatening to play Nd2-c4-d6 and also protecting the h3 pawn with my Rd3. Fritz still prefers Rg1 - although Nfd2 is given as the second best move initially, although given a few minutes to think, Fritz changes to 22. Re3 as the second best move.",
        "22... b5": "Played to stop Nd2-c4, but it makes his bishop even worse. Fritz prefers Kf8 or f5.",
        "23. Rg1": "Fritz like this move and puts white at +1.8 now.",
        "23... Kf8": "This move seemed natural to me, although Fritz prefers g6 or Qf8.",
        "24. Rdg3": "Fritz gives this as the best move and gives the advantage to white as plus 2.7 \nNow Rg8? or Rh7? are both met with Nf6! his next move is virtually forced.",
        "24... g6": "But now f6 is horribly weak too.",
        "25. Qf3": "Moving the queen over and threatening Rxg6. Fritz prefers h4.",
        "25... Kg7": "At the time, this seemed the natural move to me, but Fritz prefers Ke8 or Qh4.\nFritz now likes 26. h4 still, or Nf6, but I chose another move.",
        "26. Ng5": "With the idea of 27. Nxf7 Qxf7 28. Rxg6 Qxg6 29. Qf6 winning.",
        "26... Be8": "But he doesn't allow that. Fritz thinks this is the best move for black. ",
        "27. Nde4": "Fritz likes this move, but still prefers 27. h4",
        "27... Rh4": "So he tries to block 28. h4\nFritz also likes Rd7 or Nb6",
        "28. Rg3g4": "I offer and exchange - why not exchange off defending pieces? Fritz gives this as the second best move and prefers Nf6.",
        "28... Rh6": "Given as the best move for black, with Rh8 given as second best. He certainly can't afford to exchange on g4. I take back with the h pawn and sail in down the h file.",
        "29. Qf4": "Fritz thinks this move is best! ",
        "29... Nb6": "It is getting very hard for black!",
        "30. Rh4": "With the threat of Nxe6 followed by Qxh6 mating.",
        "30... Rxh4": "This is virtually forced.",
        "31. Qxh4": "I take back, with the massive threat of Qh7 mating. Fritz actually gives 31...Qxg5 as the only move to prevent a quick mate.",
        "31... Qb4": "Queen comes out to give his king a flight square, and a possible counter attack on my king.",
        "32. Nd6": "Fritz says it is mate in 7. At the time I just knew I was winning.",
        "32... Rc8": "As good as anything. What would you play now dear reader?",
        "33. Nxe8+": "Fritz gives this as mate in 8, but even better was Ndxf7. If now Rxe8 34. Qh7+ Kf8 35. Qxf7#\t",
        "33... Kf8": "So this is the only move to prevent an early mate.",
        "34. Nd6": "With best defence, it is mate in 12. Fritz says I missed a mate in 7 with Qh7.",
        "34... Na4": "One last hope from black - that I will take the rook and allow him to mate me with Qxb2. He did play on until I played my 37th move, but I will leave here dear reader with a puzzle - how did I mate in 4 from this position?\nMany thanks for reading. Please rate the annotation on the star system and leave a comment or two to let me know how I am doing. Until next time dear reader!"
