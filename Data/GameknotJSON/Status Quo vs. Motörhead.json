        "3... cxd5 4. c4": "Strongest!",
        "4... Nf6 5. Nc3 Nc6": "!? Of course, Anatoly Karpov plays the best move in this position: 5...e6",
        "6. Bg5": "! 6.Sf3 is not as strong as the text move. But \"Endspielingenieure\" prefer to play calmly.",
        "6... e6": "Only move. Qa5 was played by myself on previous occasions but my last success was a loss. It was time to change!",

        "16. cxb6 axb6 17. Qh5 h6 18. Rfe1": "? Better was 18.f4 with attacking chances on the f-file. Still, the black knight is out of lay and this fact gives white a better position. I think this is why 13.-Sa5 was not good enough.",
        "18... Nc6": "Only move - the return of the knight.",

        "25. Re2 Rba8 26. Rc2": "Although white has two weaknesses (a2 and c3) and black has got only one b5 along with the bad bishop I would say that the position is drawish. Black can hardly open the postion with Kg7 and f6. It would give white also chances."
