        "5... cxd4": "This move lets black win a pawn (and maybe more if white is careless).",
        "6. g3": "I don't understand this move at all, it leaves his knight undefended, and a fianchettoed bishop doesn't do much when the opposite knight is already developed. Because of this, white loses a piece for a pawn.",
