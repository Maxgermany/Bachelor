        "1. c4 Nf6 2. Nf3 c5 3. g3 d5 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Ndb4 8. Nxc6 Qxd1+ 9. Kxd1 Nxc6 10. Bxc6+ bxc6 11. Nc3 e5 12. Be3 h5 13. h4 Bb4 14. Kd2 Ke7 15. Rhc1 Rd8+ 16. Ke1 Be6 17. a3 Bxc3+ 18. Rxc3 Bd5": "White's formal positional advantage is clear enough, and consists of the split black queenside pawns. However, with opposite-coloured bishops on the board, it is hard to believe that this advantage should prove sufficient for a win. In the absence of the rooks, there would of course be no winning chances at all, but with two pairs of rooks on the board, the drawing tendency of the opposite bishops is greatly reduced. Andersson gives a veritable tour de force of technique.",
        "19. b4": "As always, fixing weaknesses is crucial.",
        "19... Rdb8": "A key tactical point of White's last move is that Black cannot get rid of the weak a-pawn by 19 ... a5? because of 20 bxa5 Rxa5? 21. Bb6. He will therefore have to remain with both queenside pawn weaknesses.",
        "20. Bd2 Ke6": "Once again, tactics prevent Black ridding himself of the a-pawn: 20 ... a5? 21. bxa5 Rxas 22. Re3 winning a pawn.",
        "21. Rc5 Rb5 22. Rcc1": "This is an important moment. As stated above, the more pieces remain on the board, the less great will be the drawing tendency of the opposite coloured bishops. Andersson therefore keeps both rooks on.",
        "22... f6 23. a4 Rb7 24. Rc5 Rg8 25. f3": "Black is seeking to establish counterplay on the kingside by ...g7-g5, so White takes prophylactic measures\nagainst this. The text threatens to trap the enemy bishop after 26. e4, thus inducing the reply.",
        "25... f5": "At a stroke, Black's potential kingside counterplay has been eliminated.",
        "26. Kf2 Rd8 27. Bc3 e4 28. Rd1 Rdd7 29. Ke3 g6 30. f4": "An interesting choice. On the principle of \"two weaknesses\", White would normally try to keep the kingside open, so as to have the possibility of infiltrating with his king. However, this would mean his pieces being tied to the defence of the pawn on f3. Instead, Andersson closes the kingside, but thereby frees his hands to concentrate on the queenside weaknesses. His plan now is to transfer his king over to defend the b4-pawn, and then attack the a-pawn with all his might, bringing his rooks to a6 and a5, and placing the bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal.",
        "30... Rd6 31. Rb1 Rdd7 32. Bd4 Kf7 33. Rb2": "As always, Andersson is in no hurry. Before the king can leave e3, he needs to ensure that Black has no dangerous discoveries with his bishop from d5 (e.g. 33. Kd2? Ba2), so Andersson removes his last piece from a white square.",
        "33... Ke6 34. Kd2 Kf7": "Now 34 ..Bb3? just loses a pawn after 35. Rxc6+ Kf7 36. Rxb3 Rxd4+ 37. Ke3, e.g. 37 ..Rdxb4 38. Rxb4 Rxb4 39. Rc7+ Ke6 40. Rxa7 etc.",
        "35. Kc3 Ke6": "Black has no counterplay and can only mark time.",
        "36. Ra5 Kf7 37. Ra6 Rde7 38. Bc5 Red7 39. Rd2": "White now wishes to get his rook on d2 to a5, which involves playing the king to a3, moving the bishop to e3 or d4, and then playing Rc2-c5-a5. With Black devoid of counterplay, White has time to execute such a manoeuvre.",
        "39... Rbc7 40. Be3 Rcb7 41. Bc5": "Again we see the \"repetition trick\". White gains time on the clock and underlines Black's helplessness.",
        "41... Rbc7 42. Rc2 Rcb7 43. Kb2 Rdc7 44. Ka3 Rcd7 45. e3": "Getting another pawn off a light square and securing the post d4 for the bishop.",
        "45... Rdc7 46. Bd4": "Now it is clear that the a7-pawn is doomed.",
        "46... Rcd7 47. Rc5 Rbc7 48. Kb2": "Once again, a typical Andersson touch. There is nothing wrong with the immediate 48 Rca5, but nor is there any hurry to play this move. Consequently, Andersson just improves his king, by bringing it to the more central square c3. It has done its job on a3, by clearing the c-file for the rook to come to c5; now the king returns to a more central position.",
        "48... Rcb7 49. Kc3 Rb6": "Black finally wearies of shuffling his rook to and fro along the seventh rank, and instead forces the exchange of a pair of rooks, but it is too late to make any difference.",
        "50. Rca5 Rxa6 51. Rxa6 Ba2": "Now he loses c6, but there was no defence anyway. White will just capture on a7 with the bishop, maintain\nhis grip, and gradually advance the a-pawn.",
        "52. Rxc6": "A superb piece of patient, systematic technique by Andersson. It is difficult to believe that the starting position of this ending is lost for Black, but even harder to pinpoint a clear or decisive error on his part!"
