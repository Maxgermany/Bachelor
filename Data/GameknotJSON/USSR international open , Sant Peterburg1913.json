        "6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Qc2": "better was 8.b3 followed by Bb2 and white finish his development , and the white queen should be on e2 in that case after 8.B3-B6.9.Bb2-Bb710.Qe2-a5.11.a4-Bb4.13.e4-dxe.11.Nxe4 and white is better . this variation was played later by Aleknine him self vs Bogoljubov in a match in 1934 .",
