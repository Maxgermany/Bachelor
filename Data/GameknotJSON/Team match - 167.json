        "1. e4 e5 2. Nc3": "Vienna Game opening.",
        "2... Nf6": "Vienna Game, Falkbeer response.",
        "3. Nf3 Bc5 4. Bc4 d6 5. Ng5 O-O 6. O-O Ng4 7. d3 Nxf2": "Out of the database again.  Frriedel appears to favor this knight/bishop pawn/rook trade.",
        "8. Rxf2 Bxf2+ 9. Kxf2 h6 10. Nf3 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3 Qh4+ 13. Qg3 Qxg3+ 14. Kxg3": "At this point black has three pawns out, white has three pawns out, but white also has a knight and bishop in the field and the king out.  Without queens the king becomes a much more potent piece, though black still has two rooks against white's one.  ",
        "14... c6 15. Be3 b5 16. Bb3 a5 17. a3 a4 18. Ba2 Nd7 19. Rf1 Nf6 20. Bxh6": "At first blush this looks like a bad move, but PxB leaves Nf6 undefended.  This is actually a pretty decent move.",
        "20... Nh5+ 21. Kg4 Nf6+ 22. Kg5": "Too hasty?  Kf5 seems like a better move.",
        "22... Nh7+ 23. Kf5 gxh6 24. Rf3 Ng5 25. Rg3 Kh7 26. Ne2 Rae8 27. h4 Ne6 28. Kg4 Rfg8+ 29. Kf3 Rxg3+ 30. Kxg3 Rg8+ 31. Kf3 Nd8 32. g4 Kg6 33. Ng3 Rh8 34. h5+ Kg5 35. Nf5 Ne6": "This does not protect against NxPd6.",
        "36. c3": "NxPd6 kind of forces Rh7 or Rf8, or Kf6, leaving the white knight free for more mischief.",
        "36... Nf4 37. Nxd6": "There we go.  Pf7 looks like a goner.",
        "37... Rf8": "I like NxPf7+, forcing Kf6 followed by NxPh6.",
        "38. d4": "This splits white's beautiful and precious a-e string of pawns.",
        "38... exd4 39. cxd4": "I still prefer NxPf7+.  The bishop is guarding it.  Kf6 results in KxNf4.",
        "39... Nd3": "Now white loses Pb2.  NxPf7+ still picks up Ph6 too."
