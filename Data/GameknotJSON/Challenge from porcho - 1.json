        "1. d4 Nc6": "I think this is a bit of a mistake as I can chase him.",
        "2. d5 e5": "?? And this is the blunder. I guess he just wasn't thinking.",
        "3. dxc6 Qf6": "This opponent always tries to get scholar's mate, but much better would have been taking my pawn.",
        "4. cxd7+ Bxd7": "Well I'm up by three points so I thought \"Well this should be easy\" Yeah...easy",
        "5. e4 Bc5 6. Nf3": "I was feeling pretty good, not paying much attention and basically underestimating my opponent since I was ahead. I didn't notice that he had three pieces developed to my one.",
        "6... Bg4 7. Be2 Bxf3 8. Bxf3 Qh4": "He tries a different approach... ",
        "9. g3 Qh3": "Uh-oh, I can't castle. ",
        "10. Bg4": "I felt really clever making this move, I thought \"ha! to stop me from playing Qd7+ he has to give up his queen!\" I didn't realize I guess that it wouldn't do much.",
        "10... Qg2 11. Qd7+ Kf8": "Uh... Now what?",
        "12. Rf1": "Defend rook",
        "12... Ne7 13. Be3 Qxe4": "Uh oh... Pawn gone. What do I do now? I know, play like an idiot",
        "14. Ke2": "I saw that he could play Bxe3 f2xe3 Qxe3+ so I decided to defend my bishop. Why I couldn't have just played Nc3 counterattacking his queen is a mystery.",
        "14... Qxc2+": "Um pawn gone... What do I do now?",
        "15. Nd2": "Block and develop at the same time. And lose another pawn",
        "15... Bd6 16. Bg5": "I was trying to keep up my 'attack' although I was still leaving my pawn hanging.",
        "16... Nc6 17. Bh5 Nd4+ 18. Ke1 Qf5 19. Qxf5": "I thought: Oh good, now the danger's over, his queen is gone and I've got an easy game. After all, I'm up a knight. I guess I didn't realize that I was also down two pawns.",
        "19... Nxf5 20. Bg4": "Well in hindsight I have to admit that white is better. But I played pretty badly earlier.",
        "20... Nd4": "Threatens a very obvious fork that suddenly I miss",
        "21. Ne4": "See what I mean by I was playing like a 1st class idiot?",
        "21... Nc2+ 22. Kd1 Nxa1 23. Re1 f6 24. Bh4 Rd8": "Well look how the tides have turned. Suddenly he's up by four points (Though his knight won't live long) and threatening a tactic that surprisingly I see. I guess the shock of his fork brought me back to reality.",
        "25. Kc1 Bb4 26. Re3 Rd4 27. Bf5 Rc4+": "? Just drives my king closer to his knight",
        "28. Nc3": "...Better would have been Kb1",
        "28... Rd4 29. Kb1 Bxc3 30. Rxc3 Rd1+ 31. Rc1 Rd4": "I'm starting to think: Hey, my position isn't terrible. After I win his knight I've got the bishop pair against his rook.",
        "32. Kxa1 Kf7 33. Rxc7+": "Oh yay I've equalized and I think white has the advantage now.",
        "33... Kg8 34. a3": "I saw something very nice involving his back rank and my bishops that would win his rook, I bet you can find it, but first I had to deal with my back rank.",
        "34... Rd1+ 35. Ka2 g6": "???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? Joy! This is probably the worst move he could have played.",
        "36. Be6+": "High-yah! I now see the possibility of more than winning his rook",
        "36... Kf8 37. Bxf6 Ke8 38. Rc8+ Rd8 39. Rxd8#": "And checkmate. While not a great game I felt it would be funny to annotate."
