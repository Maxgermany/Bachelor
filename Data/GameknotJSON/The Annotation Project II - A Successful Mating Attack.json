        "1. f4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nHere is my second game of the queen sac arising from Bird's Opening which ended in a welcome victory.  I had the black pieces again but I decided not to put Glenda on e8 this time and try and escape the bind.  This I did and Glenda was instrumental in guiding my rating in a northerly direction, arriving at 1850!  Here is how it happened.  We pick up the action on move 8.",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6": "8. ..... Kc6 - Henry does not have the square c7 at his disposal so he moves to c6 which was his usual spot in the Annotation Project Pt.1.",
        "9. Bxg4 e5": "9. ........ e5 - here I decide to strike out in the centre instead of moving Glenda to e8.  This gives Fou Lenoir the option of developing on the f8-a3 diagonal or onto g7.",
        "10. Nxe4 Qh4+": "10. ...... Qh4+ - What Ho! What Ho!  Glenda gets on her broomstick very early on in the game and makes her presence felt by the white monarch.",
        "11. Nf2": "11. Nf2 - defends his lsb.",
        "11... Bc5": "11. .... Bc5 - development and attacking the knight on f2.",
        "12. Bf3+ Kb6 13. O-O": "13. 0-0 - castles and doubly defends the knight on f2 which is now pinned.  I now snaffle up the f4 pawn while I get the opportunity.",
        "13... exf4 14. c3 Bxf2+ 15. Rxf2": "15. Rxf2 - I decided to trade anyway since I am still 3 points up in material giving white less possibility of counterplay.",
        "15... Nd7": "15. ...... Nd7 - and now I clear the decks on the back row.",
        "16. d4 g5": "16. .... g5 - protecting the f4 pawn and suddenly launching the beginnings of a mating attack (spearheaded by Glenda) against the WK.",
        "17. Nd2 g4": "17. ..... g4 - continuing the attack.",
        "18. Nc4+ Ka6 19. Be2": "19. Be2 - threatening a discovery and after some assessment I decide to ignore it and continue with my attack.  My next move g3 threatens # in 3!",
        "19... g3 20. Ne5+ b5": "20. ..... b5 - my opponent, seeing that he may have to allow mate or drop the rook decides to wave the white flag.  Nice."
