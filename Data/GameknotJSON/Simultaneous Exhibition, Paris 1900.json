        "1. e4 e5 2. Nc3": "Pillsbury intends to drive his KBP forward, so he doesn't yet move his KN.",
        "2... Nc6": "The amateur responds with symmetry, unsure of how to handle Pillsbury's unusual opening.",
        "3. f4": "In effect, a delayed King's Gambit.",
        "3... d6": "Declining the gambit, a move that even by a grandmaster leads to equality at best. The proper way to refute the King's Gambit is to accept the Pawn and return it later for a positional advantage.",
        "4. Nf3": "Now that his KBP is advanced, Pillsbury can develop this Knight.",
        "4... a6": "A wasted move. The pin was no real threat.",
        "5. Bc4": "Pointing balefully at the K-side.",
        "5... Bg4": "Apparently the amateur is unaware of the Legal pitfall.",
        "6. fxe5": "The junction point. The correct reply is 6... PxP!",
        "6... Nxe5": "This move loses the game, either quickly or slowly.",
        "7. Nxe5": "Black can lose slowly by conceding a piece: 7... PxN 8 QxB, and White has a long but easy win with his material advantage.",
        "7... Bxd1": "Black chooses to die quickly. Mate in 2 follows.",
        "8. Bxf7+": "Forcing Black's response.",
        "8... Ke7": "The final gasp.",
        "9. Nd5#": "A classic trap, well executed by Pillsbury."
