        "13... Qh6 14. Qa4+ c6": "A mistake. Now White can drop his Queen onto a diagonal that prevents Black from castling.",
        "15. Qa3": "And he does.",
        "15... Nf2 16. Rxe5+": "White recaptures his piece without losing a tempo.",
        "16... Be6 17. Kf1 Qh1+ 18. Ng1 Nh3": "A dubious sacrifice. Black loses a powerfully posted attacking piece to free a file for his Pawn.",
        "19. gxh3 f3 20. Bg5": "With four pieces to one involved, White's attack is more potent than Black's.",
