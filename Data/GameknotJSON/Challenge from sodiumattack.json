        "1. e4": "This is a game between me and my friend patagusto. I decided to annotate it since I think it is has some strategical and tactical themes.",
        "1... e5 2. f4": "The King's gambit was one of the most important opening in the romantic age of chess.\nThe theory teach us that accepting white's sacrifice is a better choice than refusing it with 2. ... Bc5 or 2. ... d6.",
        "2... exf4 3. Nf3 g5": "This is the classical line in the KGA. The modern one is 3. ... d5 and is more quiet than this, which can lead to some fireworks.",
        "4. Bc4 g4 5. O-O": "The Muzio gambit. White is ready to sacrifice a whole piece to obtain a decisive development advantage and open lines.",
        "5... gxf3 6. Qxf3 Qf6 7. e5 Qxe5": "The E-file is now open.",
        "8. d3 Bh6 9. Nc3 Ne7 10. Bd2 Nbc6 11. Rae1 Qf5": "White's development is finished. All pieces are ready to attack, while black has \"only\" a material advantage.",
        "12. Nd5": "White's knight is attacking c7, threatening both the king and the rook. This simple and natural move shows how important is the coordination of pieces.",
        "12... Kd8": "Black has to defend c7.",
        "13. Qe2": "The E-file will be decisive. White's increasing the pressure on it.",
        "13... Nxd5": "Black decides to exchange the knights. Maybe 13. ... Qe6 would be a stronger defense.",
        "14. Bxd5 Qxd5": "14. ... Qxd5? is a mistake. The weakness on the c3-h8 diagonal is clearly visible. If black would try to save his rook, Bf6  and then Qe7#.",
        "15. Bc3": "Consequent. White exploits the great dark diagonal weakness.",
        "15... Qe6": "Black understimates the his weakness on h4-d8 diagonal. Trying to close the E-file with the Q is not enough to defend the position.\nPerhaps moving 15. ... Bg5 would be a thougher defense.",
        "16. Qh5": "White's threatens black's queen: another matter that emphasizes the mistake of 15. ... Qe6?",
        "16... Qg6": "Black's proposing the exchange of the queens to reduce the pressure of white's attack, but, again, is not enough. Anyway, black's position is difficult.",
        "17. Qxg6 fxg6": "The decisive error, but the situation is compromised. It is interesting noticing the conceptual error of taking with the F pawn instead of H: without making any calculation, we can say that taking with the F pawn is an error because of the opening of the F-line. Strategic principles are always important, also in tactical position!",
        "18. Bf6+": "The final combination starts.",
        "18... Ne7": "Forced.",
        "19. Bxe7+ Ke8": "Forced.",
        "20. Bg5+": "An interesting combination between two tactical themes: the \u00abwindmill attack\u00bb (thanks to punkusmartyrus that suggested me the right word) and the \u00abinterference\u00bb (hope this is right, in italian these themes are called \u00abvortice\u00bb and \u00abinterferenza\u00bb). With a check white gains a tempo to cancel the action of Bh6 removing the threaten on pawn f4, allowing Rf1 to take it.\n",
        "20... Kf7": "There's nothing to do for black. It is a forced mate. If 20. ... Kf8 then 21. Bxh6  Kg8 22. Rxf4 ~ 23. Rf8#.\nAfter 20. ... Kf7, follows 21. Rxf4 Kg7 (21. ... Kg8 22. Bxh6 ~ 23. Re8#) 22. Re7  Kg8 and mate in the next two moves.",
        "21. Rxf4+": "Black resigns.\nA big thanks to patagusto which played this game as black!\n\nThere are some important strategic themes in this match:\n- the importance of development and of center;\n- the power of open lines;\n- the weakness on a1-h8 and h4-d8 diagonal;\n- the importance of strategy principles also in tactical situations;\n- tactical themes of \u00abwhirl\u00bb (a little one!) and \u00abinterference\u00bb."
