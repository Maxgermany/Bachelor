He will then have enough time to step onto g7 and escort the h4 pawn safely to Glendadom where he will have a very tearful reunion with his wife before they round up Bob's king.  However, Henry was denied this reunion by Bob waving the white flag on move 71 (my positional score was +13.44 - resignation justified) so Henry had to be content with his footman to accompany him on his long victory march home rather than Glenda - but at least he survives to fight another battle - hope you have had a good read folks - bye for now - Joanne  ",
