        "11. Qf3": "So I attack f6 again.",
        "11... Qb6": "I found out afterwards that actually Bb7 instead of Qb6 is good for black. This is good for white now.",

In computer analysis afterwards, we found that black can still play c6-c5! and meet dxc5 with Qxc5! and if white takes the black queen, black can take the white queen. That is probably the best continuation for black.  ",
