    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "In this game my opponent unleashed a surprising early piece sacrifice which had me worried, but thankfully I seemed to navigate the complications better than him!",
        "1... Nf6": "So I head for an Indian set-up",
        "2. Nf3": "He also develops his King's Knight",
        "2... g6": "I prepare to fianchetto my bishop.",
        "3. Nc3": "A little bit unusual, presumably hoping for 4. e4 and a Modern Defence set-up.",
        "3... d5": "But I put a stop to that.",
        "4. Bf4": "His bishop comes out.",
        "4... Nh5": "I attack his bishop",
        "5. Bg5": "His bishop advances",
        "5... h6": "I attack his bishop again.",
        "6. Bh4": "His bishop drops back.",
        "6... g5": "I attack again, slightly weakening my King-side position, but driving his bishop back",
        "7. Bg3": "It duly drops back.",
        "7... Bf5": "Played to prevent e2-e4 and with the idea of dropping back to g6 and covering some of the weak squares on my king-side.",
        "8. e3": "So he plays it to e3 instead.",
        "8... Bg7": "I at last finish the finachetto.",
        "9. Be5": "He offers an exchange of bishops.",
        "9... f6": "I block. I was expecting his bishop to roll back to g3 now, but instead he gave me a shock with.....(you may want to pause here and consider what other move white could possibly make?)",
        "10. Nh4": "Now if I take the knight then he gets two pieces back - 10....gxh4 11. Qxh5+ and if 11...Kd7 he takes on f5 with check, or if I play Kf8 after Qxf5 my pawn on f6 is pinned. Fritz gives white an advantage of plus 1.81 here.",
        "10... Be6": "After considering 10...0-0 and 10....Bxc2, Fritz finally comes up with this move - which I played. I was really worried about 11. Ng6 here, and Fritz agrees, it is the best move for white, and gives it as plus 1.5 to white.",
        "11. Bxc7": "Thankfully he played this instead.",
        "11... Qxc7": "I take back. Fritz thinks that white is plus 1 now, but I was confident.",
        "12. Qxh5+": "White gets his piece back.",
        "12... Bf7": "But now queen and knight are hanging.",
        "13. Bb5+": "This was another surprise. ",
        "13... Nc6": "But I simply block.",
        "14. Ng6": "The only way to save a piece.",
        "14... e6": "Played to protect d5 and also to play f6-f5 if necessary.",
        "15. Bd3": "This seems rather inconsistent. He seems to have allowed me to play Nc6 with gain of time.",
        "15... f5": "Cutting off the protection of the knight.",
        "16. g4": "Trying to save his knight. Fritz gives a small advantage to black now.",
        "16... Ne7": "Fritz prefers 16....a6 as now white can play 17. Bb5+ and if 17.....Kd8 then 18. Nf4! saving the piece, as 18....Bxh5 then 19. Nxe6+ forking my king and queen. I was thinking that if Bb5+ I would have to play my knight back to c6, but after 17. h4! white is slightly better again.",
        "17. gxf5": "Now plus 1 to black.",
        "17... exf5": "I take back.",
        "18. Qf3": "Fritz agrees that this is best.",
        "18... Bxg6": "So I take.",
        "19. Nxd5": "He gets a second pawn for the piece.",
        "19... Qd6": "Fritz prefers 19....Qa5+",
        "20. Nxe7": "White takes.",
        "20... Qxe7": "Black takes back.",
        "21. Bxf5": "White gets, temporarily, a third pawn, but it is poisoned!",
        "21... O-O": "With a nasty pin.",
        "22. Qd5+": "White tries to break the pin.",
        "22... Bf7": "I have to keep attacking, I don't want him castling, getting his king to safety and rooks into play.",
        "23. Qe4": "He offers an exchange of queens.",
        "23... Qb4+": "I throw in a check.",
        "24. Kf1": "This is another mistake, c3 was indicated.",
        "24... Rae8": "Getting my last piece into play with tempo.. Black is 2 point up now, according to Fritz.",
        "25. Qf3": "Queen drops back.",
        "25... Bg6": "Dangerous pin on the bishop. Fritz actually like Be6 instead, but I didn't want him exchanging off this vulnerable bishop.",
        "26. Qd5+": "He throws in a check.",
        "26... Bf7": "Bishop drops back.",
        "27. Qf3": "Queen drops back.",
        "27... Bc4+": "Rather than repeat, I throw in a check.",
        "28. Kg2": "King moves. Fritz here likes g5-g4 now.",
        "28... Qb5": "This seemed good to me, threatening the bishop on f5 and also Bc4-d5",
        "29. e4": "He protects the bishop.",
        "29... Bxd4": "I take the pawn.",
        "30. Qh5": "He attacks - maybe hoping for a perpetual check?",
        "30... Rxf5": "Perhaps a bit speculative, but it worked out OK. Fritz prefers 30....Qc6 with plus 4 to black.",
        "31. Qg6+": "White checks.",
        "31... Bg7": "My bishop comes back. Fritz gives black as plus 3.",
        "32. exf5": "Fritz prefers taking with the queen, but either way, black as a strong attack.",
        "32... Bd5+": "Fritz gives this a plus 7 to black now.",
        "33. f3": "White blocks.",
        "33... Qe2+": "It is mate soon now.",
        "34. Kg1": "King drops back.",
        "34... Qe3+": "Queen check.",
        "35. Kg2": "King up.",
        "35... Qxf3+": "Another check.",
        "36. Kg1": "Forced.",
        "36... Qg2#": "And now mate. Many thanks for reading. Please leave a comment or two and rate this on the star system. Until next time dear reader!"
