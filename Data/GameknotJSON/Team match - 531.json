        "6. c3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 Nc6 8. O-O Bc5 9. e5": "2 good bishop for white versus a possible castle...but 2 good bishop for black versus a castle done. It's necessary push away the c5 bishop with b4 and start an attack on queenside to be ready in every side; i think with the right plan the white is a little better",
        "9... Nd5 10. Nxc6": "i think it's too soon to exchange a good knife with a not yet good knife",
        "10... Bxc6": "maybe, or probably 10... dxc6 is better to have a queenside castle more sure",
        "11. Qg4": "i think b4 - a4 waiting for black decition about his castle",
        "11... Qc7": "now is clear that the black'll castle on queenside",
        "12. Qxg7": "i think a beginner's wrong:\r\n- 2 good bishop versus the castle\r\n- a new problem, the G-column (a pawn it's now enough...)\r\n- some time will be lost to save the queen from rook attack\r\n\r\nit's a strange move for a good player...in general computers make this kind of wrong",
        "12... O-O-O 13. Bxh7": "another coloum for another pawn....it's really too",
        "13... Rxh7 14. Qxh7 Qxe5": "Rh8 it's too strong\r\nknife jump it's too strong\r\nbishops are too strong",
        "15. Qd3 Rg8 16. g3 Qh5 17. Be3 Qf3 18. Nd2": "too late to develop own pieces",
        "18... Qg2+ 19. Kxg2 Nf4+": "with mate with Nh3"
