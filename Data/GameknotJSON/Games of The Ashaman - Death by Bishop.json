        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6": "The Philidor Defense, considered inferior to the Queen's Knight and Petroff Defense because it blocks in the dark-squared bishop. Oddly there is no recorded game where Philidor played this.",
        "3. d4": "Challenging Black's center, and trying to open up the game.",
        "3... f6": "Defending the center, a poorer move than Nd7 or exd4. This unfortunately takes Black's Knight's best square and weakens the Black Kingside.",
        "4. Bc4": "Developing the Bishop which turns out to be the key piece in the combination.",
        "4... Ne7": "I think Nd7 was best here.",
        "5. Nc3": "Dxe5 immediately was best but I didn't see that then, I just developed normaly.",
        "5... a6": "?? Trying to keep my knight and bishop off this square, but missing the threat of dxe5.",
        "6. dxe5": "Starting the combination, which with good play on each side wins only a pawn.",
        "6... fxe5": "b5 or Nbc6 here were much much better, this was his first real blunder.",
        "7. Nxe5": "Threatening mate, a hard threat to deal with.",
        "7... dxe5": "?? Big blunder which loses the queen. I think d5 here was the only move.",
        "8. Bf7+": "Wins the queen, Black resigns. "
