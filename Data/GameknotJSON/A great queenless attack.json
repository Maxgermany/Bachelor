        "5... Bg4": "Black chooses the dangerous way. White has no way to save the queen except for 6.Be2, which would be awkward. ",
        "6. Qxg4": "!The signature move of the Bryntse gambit. White sacs his queen for two minor pieces, a development advantage and a generally chaotic position.",
