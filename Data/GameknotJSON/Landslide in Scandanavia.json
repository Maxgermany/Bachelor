        "1. e4": "Here White uses unusual move orders to beat the Scandanavian Defense.",
        "1... d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qa5 4. a3": "This begins a strategy of slowly constricting Black and limiting options with flexible moves that offer transpositional possibilities to favorable positions, according to the DB.",
        "4... c6 5. h3": "Here White prevents Bg4 but also lays the groundwork for an attack on the kingside.",
        "5... Nf6 6. b4": "Drives away the queen and prepares for an attack on the other wing as well as possibly fianchettoing the bishop. ",
        "6... Qc7 7. d4": "Contests the center. Note that although Black appears to be ahead in development, White is better prepared to use the open lines.",
        "7... Bf5 8. g4": "Drives the bishop away with tempo, and prepares a wing attack if Black castles kingside.",
        "8... Bg6 9. Bg2 h6 10. Nf3 Be4": "Be4?! loses a tempo and the bishop pair. ",
        "11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12. Ne5 Nf6 13. c4 e6": "At this point White is in good shape. Wherever Black puts the king, White is prepared to attack with powerful bishops.",
        "14. O-O Be7 15. f4 Nbd7 16. Nd3": "White decides to retreat the Knight. He wants to save it for the attack once Black decides which side to castle on.",
        "16... O-O-O": "...0-0-0?! While 0-0 is risky and this is common in the Scandanavian Defense main line, here White can rapidly bring every piece and a pawn storm to bear on the Black king.",
        "17. Be3 Rdg8 18. Qa4 Qb8 19. b5 cxb5 20. Qxb5 Bd6 21. c5 Bc7 22. c6 bxc6 23. Qxc6": "White has opened up the King. ",
