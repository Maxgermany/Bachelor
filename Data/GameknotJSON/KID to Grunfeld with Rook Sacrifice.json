    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6": "A traditional KID formation forms.\n",
        "3. Bf4": "The idea for this bishop move is to play Qd2 followed by Bh6 to encourage an exchange of bishops, to take away short castling from black and use a queen and king knight to play against the weakened black kingside.\n",
        "3... d5": "Black plays immediately into the center, activating a bishop, creating central tension. The text move allows development of the white squared bishop outside the pawns before playing ...e6, which will give black some play against whites queenside which will discourage 0-0-0 for white.\n",
        "4. Nc3": "Played with concepts from a QGD in mind where the knight prevents dxc4 from creating problems, and applying pressure to d5, and even presenting a tactical move like Nb5 with c7 as a target - a real vulnerability because white has good control of e5 which prevents the move ...e5 against the bishop.\n",
        "4... dxc4": "Black releases tension early, a move sometimes played at top levels, but usually not the best idea due to developmental concerns, because it costs a tempo better used for piece development.\n",
        "5. Qd2": "White continues with the planned strategy of exhanging bishops at h6.\n",
        "5... Bf5": "The bishop is played outside the pawns, which now allows ...e6 without creating a bad bishop.\n",
        "6. Nf3": "The knight is an intregal part of the strategic kingside play and will be used with the queen after exchanging bishops.\n",
        "6... Nh5": "? Black plays aggressively towards the bishop, but this does not counter whites strategy, and the knight has no continuation from h5 which offers an advantage. Better would be simply 6...Bg7 so that castling short can be played.\n",
        "7. Bh6": "White suggests an exchange of bishops.\n",
        "7... Bxh6": "An alternative was 7...Nc6 with long castling in mind.\n",
        "8. Qxh6": "+/= White gains some advantage kingside by taking away short castling, the followup Ng5 will begin the buildup of pressure against the weakened position.\n",
        "8... Nf6 9. e3": "Activating the bishop, enables Bxc4, strengthens d4 so the f3 knight is free to move.\n",
        "9... Rg8": "Prevents Qg7.\n",
        "10. Bxc4": "Equalizing materially while bringing additional threat to the black position.\n",
        "10... Rh8": "Assumedly played in anticipation of Ng5 where the knight can take h7 afterwards.\n",
        "11. Ng5": "The threat is Nxf7.\n",
        "11... e6": "An essential counter.\n",
        "12. Qg7": "?! Playing to take away black strengths a little, not a simple solution to this problem, but h7 becomes weak after ...Rf8.\n",
        "12... Rf8 13. e4": "A creative idea flashes into my mind where I create a positional bishop sacrifice, well not completely because the f5 bishop is under fire from the pawn and can be eliminated by further pawn moves. The idea is (13...Qxd4 14.exf4 Qxc4 15.fxe6), and the AI finds a reasonable alternative to this line where black begins a pawn feeding frenzy to material gain, but positional loss.\n",
        "13... Nh5": "The threat is to both queen and knight.\n",
        "14. Qh6": "Maintaining the knight which will be used for further operations.\n",
        "14... Qxd4 15. exf5": "Putting the small concept into motion.\n",
        "15... Qxc4 16. O-O-O": "I switched to the idea of sacrificing the f5 pawn to gain an active rook during play.\n",
        "16... Qf4+ 17. Kb1 Qxf5+ 18. Ka1 Qxf2": "Black feeding on a steady diet of pawns lets the position slip as white is gaining the upper hand positionally.\n",
        "19. Rhe1": "?! A simple threat of Nxe6:fxe6, Rxe6#, but black has a counter. Here I miss a nice mating line as pointed out by Toga (19.Rd8+ Ke7 20.Qxf8+ Kf6 21.h4 Ke5 22.Nxf7+ Qxf7 23.Qxf7 Nf6 24.Qxc7+ Kf5 25.Rf1+ Kg4 26.Qf4+ Kh5 27.Qg5#), I need to improve my calculating attempts. I did play this game very quickly and so my calculations were brief, a contributing factor.\n",
        "19... Nd7": "! A nice move which solves blacks problems by 0-0-0 removing the king from the rook threat.\n",
        "20. Nxh7": "I take an alternative strategy of picking away at blacks position, the rook will be weak as it moves away from the protection of the king, and f7 will become weak as well.\n",
        "20... Rg8": "Now without the rook to guard f7 there is but one piece that stands in the way, the queen.\n",
        "21. Ref1": "! The start of a stealthy combination where the rook is sacrificed at f7 to gain a strong attack against the king. This could be considered a type of exchange sacrifice because the knight at d7 will be gained.\n",
        "21... Qxg2": "Black can not resist the free pawn, but the choice is disasterous.\n",
        "22. Rxf7": "! The threat to d7 or even better to the rook at g8 is presented, this should produce a somewhat expected result.\n",
        "22... Kxf7 23. Rxd7+": "There is only one choice for the king.\n",
        "23... Ke8 24. Rxc7": "The rook remains on the 7th, just out of reach of the king, to keep the king trapped on the back rank.\n",
        "24... e5": "Played to prevent Qf4, to keep the queen out of play as much as possible.\n",
        "25. Ng5": "! Clearance for Qh7.\n",
        "25... Nf4": "I can not find a good alternative move because of the poor quality of the black position. The idea for this move is perhaps to remove the knight obstacle that prevents black from obtaining a back rank attack or mate.\nAlternative variation: 25... Qf1+ 26. Nb1 Qf8 27. Qxf8+ ( 27. Qh7 Rh8 (27... Nf6 28. Qh3 Rg7 29. Qe6+ Re7 30. Rc8+ Rxc8 31. Qxc8#) 28. Qd7#) 27... Rxf8 28. Rxb7 Rf5\n",
        "26. Qh7": "White has the won game after a few distractions from black.\n",
        "26... Qg1+ 27. Nb1 Qxb1+": "You know you are winning when you see a move like this, made in desperation.\n",
        "28. Kxb1 Rg7 29. Qh8+": "An alternative was (29.Qxg7 Nd5 30.Qg8#)\n",
        "29... Rg8 30. Qxg8#": "I have to wonder if the computer batteries are running low or if I am finding improvement in my game play. I liked the gains obtained by the rook sacrifice in the game, and the strategy to attack kingside was a long range plan involving a bishop, knight, and queen, which worked out well. A nice win in 30 moves is encouraging.\n"
