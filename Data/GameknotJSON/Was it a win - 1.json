        "5... Ng4 6. h3": "It comes to mind Qh4 (pinning the pawn to the rook). I didn't because of g3. In that case, to mantain the pin will cost several tempos to black, and I won't get much (by experience). ",
        "6... Nxe5": "f4 is disastrous for white, so this seems safe. ",
        "7. e3 d5": "Uff, just a \"shot in the dark\". I should have castled first. ",

        "22. Re1": "Preparing e5. This gives me a tempo, since is only half dangerous (Kxf6 is possible provided the rook can't penetrate). ",

        "26... a3": "Just \"crazy\". I wanted to disrupt white's pawns, so I can take them later. ",
        "27. b3": "Ok, but this gets the king into a cage. ",
        "27... Rd4": "This was not the best move, for sure. ",

        "39... Rac8": "Of course, forcing white to defend (if the bishop moves, Rc1# - I like my pawn!.... Re2, only one, but then Bxa2 becomes possible. White lost by timeout. I think white is lost, but... what do you think?"
