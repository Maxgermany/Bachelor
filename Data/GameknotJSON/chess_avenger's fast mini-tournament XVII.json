        "12. Bf4": "I made this move here to develop my bishop and clear the back for potential castles on either side.  d5 is more aggressive (probably better as well) and keeps the pressure against the opponent.",

        "14. d5 Na5": "Here d6! is definitely better.  After a few exchanges white is better with this move by about 2 points.",
        "15. Bb3 Nxb3+ 16. axb3 Bb4 17. Be5": "This move is not good.  The reason I did this move is to defend Nc3 and attack Nf6.\nThe problem with this move is white loses a pawn: Be5 Bxc3 18. bxc3 Nxd5 19. Rhe1 f6 20. c4 fxe5 21. Rxd5 Bxf3 22. gxf3",
