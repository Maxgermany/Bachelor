        "3... Bb4 4. d3 Bxc3+ 5. bxc3 d5 6. exd5 Nxd5 7. c4 Nc3 8. Qd2 Na4 9. Be2 Nc6 10. O-O Be6 11. a3 Bf5": "Kind of a wasted move.  That is, 10...Be6 should had been Bf5 instead.",
        "12. h3 O-O 13. g4 Bg6 14. g5 Nd4": "Now nothing protects Pe5 from NxPe5.",
        "15. Nxe5": "Just like that.",
        "15... Bf5 16. Rb1": "While Pb7 is not protected, white will need to move the rook in the event BxPh3.  This will give black time to defend against RxPb7.",
        "16... Bxh3 17. Re1 Qd6 18. Qf4": "Pc2 is undefended against NxPc2.  White will have to move Rd1 or lose the rook.  This, however, would be bad for white because Nc3 would then fork the two rooks.",
        "18... Nc3": "This move should have been saved until after NxPc2.",
        "19. Rb4": "Ok, white is oblivious to the threat of NxPc2 (an undefended pawn) which then forks the rooks.",
        "19... Ndxe2+": "This is actually a much superior move, though I would have used NcxBe2+, preserving the rook fork until after the queen had fallen.",
        "20. Rxe2": "Now this will hurt.  Rook, queen, and Ne5 traded for a knight and bishop...",
        "20... Nxe2+ 21. Kh2": "I take it back--NxQf4 protects the bishop.",
        "21... Nxf4 22. Bxf4 Qe6": "I kind of like Qd4, which threatens Bf4.  Let white trade bishops if he wants.",
        "23. Rxb7 f6 24. gxf6 gxf6": "While this threatens the knight, it splits the pawns, and RxPf6 attacks white's bishop instead.  White must move Bg3 to protect both it and the knight.",
        "25. Rxc7 fxe5 26. Bg3 Bf1": "This move focuses black's attention fully on the king.  Mate in four, if white sacrifices the rook.",
        "27. Kg1": "Two.",
        "27... Qh3": "Rg7+, KxR, BxPe5+, king moves to some white square...  This adds a couple extra delaying moves.\n",
