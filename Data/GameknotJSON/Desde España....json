        "1. d4": "Hi there. This is an interesting game about \"why we move our pieces\". We move them to beat king of opponent. So if you don't want to miss \"tempo\", you have to follow king and attack to king... not other passive pieces...",
        "1... d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3": "Queen's gambit.... Because you can play with this opening more safety. you always happen attacker side.",
        "3... c5": "did not move d5xc4 so he did not accept to gambit. he wants to be attacker too.",
        "4. e3 Nf6 5. Bd3": "i don't want to lost to control center. Because you can see lot's of point from center.",
        "5... Nc6 6. Nf3 cxd4 7. exd4 Be7": "He is going to O-O. So i must tend to g7 h7...",
        "8. Bf4": "This move is important i think. because knight e5 needs a bodyguard. so bishop will safe knight at e5. I will play e5 later because i am following his king.",
        "8... a6": "he thinks that i will tend to other passive pieces. But important is his king...",
        "9. a3 Bd6 10. Bg5 dxc4 11. Bxc4 Be7 12. Bf4": "i don't want to exchange my bishop. Because it is at active position. ",
        "12... O-O 13. O-O b5 14. Bb3": "Bd3 would not be a good move. because 14 Bd3 - Kxd4 15 Kxd4 - Qxd4... so i would lost a pawn, and an active knight, and my bishop would be inactive.",
        "14... Qb6 15. Bc2 Rd8": "he is trying to take my pawn. but i am trying to beat his king. my target is more true.",
        "16. Ne2 Nxd4 17. Nexd4 Bc5 18. Be5": "i want to threat his knight and save to my knight at the same time.",
        "18... Ng4": "Kfg4? this move maybe looks so dangerous for my bishop. But he forget his king. i think this is his worst move. because he can't save to h7 and g7 now.",
        "19. Bxh7+": "h7 ! and now he have to decide.. run or take my bishop or h8... i think he had to move f8. because his king is alone there. needs to safety.",
        "19... Kh8": "second mistake. he thinks  20 kg5 - kxe5.. he is right but there is more dangerous after these moves. My queen will have a good way to be active.",
        "20. Ng5 Nxe5 21. Qh5 Bb7": "as i said if you don't want to miss tempo, you must fallow to king, not other passive pieces. now i have three dangerous and active pieces near to his king. but my king is in safety.",
        "22. Bg6+ Kg8 23. Bxf7+ Nxf7 24. Qxf7+ Kh8 25. Ndxe6": "He resigned..."
