    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5": "The Sicilian. I'm not a specialist, by any means, but I thrive in tactical positions. I usually play the main line as far as I can remember for whatever variation we select, then go on as is natural/best (as my limited Chess prowess can calculate, anyway).",
        "2. Nf3 d6 3. b3 e6 4. Bb2 Nd7 5. Bb5 Ngf6 6. Bxf6": "?! I can discern no good reason for this move. He gives up the bishop pair, dethrones his fianchetto along the a1-h8 diagonal, and allows my queen to step into play (perhaps a little earlier than I'd like, but he does not have any obvious moves to force tempi loss).",
        "6... Qxf6 7. Nc3 a6": "Encouraging the exchange.",
        "8. Bxd7+ Bxd7 9. O-O Bc6 10. Re1 O-O-O": "d5 was planned, but the exchange would lead to a discovered check after Re1. This move was necessary.",
        "11. Re3": "?! Elevating rooks is generally a good idea, but this thrust is quite naive. Not yet disastrous, but the rook will be knocked around for a loss of tempi, at best.",
        "11... d5": "Hoping for the pawn exchange, and thus, a commanding pawn presence on c5 and d5.",
        "12. e5": "Declining the pawn exchange. The proper move, and one I shamefully did not predict until just after I had submitted d5.",
        "12... Qh6": "Putting potential pressure on h2.",
        "13. Ne2": "?? This loses the exchange. The rook is only a rank away from two pawns, and the Knight has just cut off his escape route.",
        "13... d4": "! One way or another, black will lose material.",
        "14. Rd3 Be4": "And now the rook falls.",
        "15. Nc1": "Setting up to command the e5 square after the capture and recapture on d3.",
        "15... Bxd3 16. Nxd3 Rd7": "A somewhat clumsy move to protect f7.",
        "17. Qe2 Be7 18. c3": "?! This move encourages the pawn exchange, which opens up the pawn formations on the d-file; a file I control with an elevated rook.",
        "18... dxc3 19. dxc3 Rhd8": "Now both rooks are bearing down a file free from pawns. White has taken on a key defensive obligation in d3.",
        "20. Rd1 Kb8": "Purely defensive. I was ahead positionally and materially, but I didn't want to take any chances, and was willing to pay a tempi to solidify my king defensively.",
        "21. Nfe1 f6": "The e-pawn was enough of an annoyance to remove.",
        "22. exf6 Bxf6 23. c4": "Forcing either a defensive move that puts the Queen largely out of play, or c4, which largely puts the pawn formation out of play. It was already a lost game for White, and though I was cautious enough to remain aware, I was not worried about any real threat of counterattack.",
        "23... Bc3": "Pressuring the Knight on e1. One of the links in this chain is bound to fail, and when it does, the whole defense will come crashing down.",
        "24. Nf3 Qg6": "Putting even more pressure on d3. The Knight on f3 is tied to that square. 25. Ne5 simply encourages an exchange of material, which is beneficial for Black, who is on top. The check following a recapture on e5 by White's Queen can easily be averted with Ka8, essentially removing all future threat from White. 25. Nh4? Rxd3 is even worse.",
        "25. Nfe1": "This looks strangely familiar.",
        "25... Bxe1": "The hammer blow, and White's defense crumbles.",
        "26. Rxe1 Rd7xd3 27. Qe5+ Ka8": "And here White resigned. Despite my far lower rating, a sharp tactical blow in the middlegame followed by a commanding presence on the d-file sealed the win."
