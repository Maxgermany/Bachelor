        "1. e3 Nc6": "Nc6!? I don't actually know why i went for this move.",
        "2. Bc4 e6": "I was preparing for a d7-d5 launch on the white bishop.",
        "3. Bb5": "Waste of move, why didn't he do that last move?",
        "3... Nge7": "Simple defense of knight and now i'm ahead in development.",
        "4. b3": "b3!? Normally i would go for g3.",
        "4... d5": "Now i have control of most of the center.",
        "5. Bb2": "Nice diagonal (b2-f6) for the bishop, targeting my kingside.",
        "5... f6": "Blocking threat and now control more of the board.",
        "6. Qh5+": "Qh5+ aren't you supposed to keep your queen not attacking in the very beginning? His tactic is a bit to clear 6...g6 7.Bxf6 then a big threat, it was easy to read this.",
        "6... Ng6 7. Nh3": "Nh3?! why not Nf3-the normal move, or Bxc6+! 7...bxc6 now doubled up pawns.",

        "8... Bd6": "Beefing up e5 from the threat.",
        "9. g3": "A luft for the king isn't really useful now as there is no threat against it yet. Why not just  play a simple Nc3?",
        "9... O-O": "Safely castling, getting out of that pin from the queen. However, with the threat of the Bb2, Nh3 and Qh5 a really good idea? Quite risky i suppose.",

        "11. Re1": "Re1?? I actually can't believe he did this. Well we all do miss a move at least once in our life. However, it does strengthen e3. Remember-TACTICAL VISION!",

        "14. a4": "a4!? i didn't see the point of this move...",
        "14... d4": "Now it's a closed pawn center, Now attack on the wings is the way to win this game. I have now a nice pawn chain from h7 to d4.",

        "17. Na3 d5 18. exd5 cxd5": "Now i have a lovely pawn structure, i told you doubled up pawns aren't bad, i control c4 and e4 with it!",
