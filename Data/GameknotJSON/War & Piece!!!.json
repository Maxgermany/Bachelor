        "9. Bxc6+ bxc6": "thitho: taking with queen wouldn't have changed for a better: you would have taken back with your own queen...",

        "17. Bc1": "Why not c3 or Nc3??\nthitho: indeed, combining the rooks was necessary, but still I think the last moves were almost impossible to avoid, unless giving the quality by Rxe5.",
