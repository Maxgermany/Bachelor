        "20... Qd8": "Let's take stock of this position. Pawn structure: Both sides have two pawn islands, but one of white's is isolated. Black is slightly better in pawn structure. Piece activity: None of black's pieces are farther than the seventh rank. Black is extremely passive, and white is better in piece activity. Material: equal. Central control: White almost exclusively controls the center.",

        "42. Kg4": "And I take the opposition. This was enough for my opponent to offer a draw, as he though having my king advanced and his pushed back was enough to compensate for my doubled pawns.",
        "42... Rb1": "Game is drawn. It wasn't a particularly exciting game, but it made me pretty happy because I made no computer recognizable errors."
