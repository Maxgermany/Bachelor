        "1. e4 c5 2. b4": "I do not normally play this opening, because against better players I never can make up the loss of that pawn.  This gambit is the \"Sicilian Wing Gambit\" and each game of Ipsissimus's tournament began with this particular opening.",
        "2... e5": "Black declines the gambit.",
        "3. Nf3": "If white plays PxPc5, black responds BxPc5 and gains positional advantage.",
        "3... Nc6 4. b5 Nd4 5. Bc4 Nxf3+": "I was amused by this exchange, as QxNf3 threatens mate (easily defended).",
        "6. Qxf3 Nf6": "Although the queen comes out early, white seems to enjoy greater dominance of the battlefield.",
        "7. d3 b6 8. Bb2 d6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. Nd5 Nxd5": "Black's eagerness to trade knights will prove costly.  White will pick up black's f pawn.",
        "11. Bxd5 Rb8 12. Qxf7+ Kd7 13. Qxg7": "This is generally considered a \"poisoned\" pawn, but white ends up with the h pawn too.  In hindsight 13. Be6+ might have been better.  Kc7, 14. BxBc8 followed by Qxg7.  There is a long way to the end game, but no reason not to start trading down early.",
        "13... Kc7 14. O-O Bb7 15. f4": "White thinks PxPf4, 16. QxRh8, QxQ, BxQ, RxB is a good deal, but black doesn't fall for that.",

        "22. Qxe8": "Black could pick up a pawn here with BxPh2+ before seizing the queen.",
