        "1. e4": "A game I had here recently. Feel free to leave any comments if you think I could have done anything better. Gameknot Computer Analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22773517&rnd=0.7207947066053748",
        "1... e6 2. d4": "Expecting a French.",
        "2... Be7": "Doesn't look like a bad move, but surely there's more active solutions than this, such as d5.",
        "3. c4": "Gaining space.",
        "3... Nf6 4. Nc3": "Oh how I love moving the knight after the pawn already moved. Perhaps one downside to my position is how the c&e pawns block my LSB. I do enjoy space, however~~",
        "4... Nc6 5. Nf3": "I considered f4, but this seems more solid.",
        "5... O-O 6. Bd3 Nb4": "I didn't consider this move.",
        "7. Be2": "I can kick the knight next turn, but black has a chance to play c5 now, which looks good, breaking at the center, while my king isn't castled. I may have space, but my opponent has a development advantage.",
        "7... h6": "? I think c5 was a better move, Perhaps even d5?",
        "8. a3 Nc6 9. b4": "b4! If I castle here, black can play a5, restricting b4. ",
        "9... a5 10. b5 Na7": "I should be better here.",
        "11. O-O c6": "I considered a4, so if cxb I can recapture with the pawn, but this weakens the b4 square.",
        "12. e5": "Idea was to kick the knight, then go Ne4, to jump into blacks weak dark squares. Perhaps Re1 or d5 were moves to consider as well?",
        "12... Nh7 13. Ne4 f5": "I was a bit worried to see this move, as it makes sense. Black can try for an attack on the kingside, though I believe my attack will be quicker, do to the big queenside space advantage.",
        "14. Nd6": "Had to move the knight. I don't think taking is good, as blacks dark squares will be very weak.",
        "14... g5 15. d5": "I think this is important. I need to strike in the center/queenside before any kingside attack starts.",
        "15... Qb6": "I don't like this, because of my response.",
        "16. Be3 Qc7": "Loses a piece. Qd8 had to be played.\n\nEdit: c5 had to be played. Qd8 loses the knight after b6.",
        "17. b6 Qb8 18. bxa7 Qc7 19. Rb1": "Threatening Bb6, winning the queen, while developing.",
        "19... b6": "Doesn't stop my threat.",
        "20. Bxb6 Qxd6 21. exd6 Bxd6 22. dxe6 Be7 23. exd7 Bb7 24. d8=Q": "Trying to simplify the position. However, if Black hadn't taken with his A8 rook, things would have remained more complicated.",
        "24... Bxd8 25. Qxd8 Raxd8 26. Bxd8 Rxd8 27. Rxb7": "An easy win now.",
        "27... Nf6 28. Rb8 Re8 29. Rxe8+ Nxe8 30. a8=Q Kf8 31. c5": "Idea is to let my LSB in.",
        "31... g4 32. Ne5 h5 33. Bc4 Ke7 34. Qxc6 Ng7 35. Qd6+": "And mate is coming soon. Hope you guys enjoyed! Expect to see more from me here!"
