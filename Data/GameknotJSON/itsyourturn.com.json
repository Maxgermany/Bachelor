        "5. e4": "White should have played 5. Nf3 first, which prevents Black from getting a pawn in the center.\n\nNow Black is doing well after 5... e5 6. dxe5 Qxd1+.  If 6. d5 then 6... Bb4 7. f3 c6 and Black is slightly better.",

        "15. d5": "White is going to rid himself of his pawn weakness.  This also frees the White queen to go to b3.\n\nIf 15... b5? 16. Bd3 White is fine.  If Black were to pursue 16... exd5?! 17. Nxd5 Qxb2? 18. Rc1 or 18. Qf3 and Black has too many weaknesses.",
