        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis is my third game in Master Freddy's mini-tournament about the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack.  For me it was third time lucky in respect of clocking up my first win (although the Low Draw with Yoshark - which he annotated, I was extremely lucky!).  In response to 9. Bxg4 I try a different response, g6 to see what happened there and it certainly worked out well.  Anyhow, on with the match.  We pick up the action on move 9.",

        "10. Nf7": "10. Nf7 - a nasty looking knight fork but Glenda is now gonna take you all by surprise, she decides to venture into enemy territory.",
        "10... Qd4": "10. ....... Qd4 - an aggressive placement for a Queen do you agree, she could be chased away but white decides to develop.",
        "11. Nc3 Bg7 12. Nxh8 Bxh8": "12. .......... Bxh8 - that's gotten rid of that nasty horsie even at the expense of one of my castles!",
        "13. Ne2 Qf6": "13. ....... Qf6 - Glenda is now chased away but she finds a fairly decent square.",
        "14. h4 Na6": "14. ........ Na6 - development.",
        "15. g3 Nb4": "15. ........ Nb4 - now my horsie gets in on the act - he is threatening Nc2+",
        "16. Kd1 Rd8": "16. ...... Rd8 - centralisation.",
        "17. c3 Nd3": "17. ....... Nd3 - what's this? What's this?  Aggressive stuff from Joanne the Kitten?  Yup, it is certainly that, for a starters the WK is pinned in the centre.",
        "18. Rf1 Qd6": "18. ....... Qd6 - now Glenda lines up on the d file.",
        "19. Kc2 Nxc1 20. Raxc1": "20. Raxc1 - a N for B trade.  Now the d3 square is occupied by .........",

        "21. Kb3 c4+": "21. ...... c4+ - a king hunt begins in earnest.",
        "22. Ka3 Qd6+": "22. ........ Qd6+ - white now waves the white flag as I am closing in on the WK.  After the first two matches I see some light at the end of a very dark tunnel!"
