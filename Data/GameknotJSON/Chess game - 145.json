        "11... O-O": "Taking King to safety.",
        "12. Qd3": "Developing the queen as well as opening two possibilities for white to castle. ",
        "12... Re8": "King in the center so launching the attack immediately on the opposing king..!",
        "13. O-O-O": "Its High time so castled Queen side bcoz there are less pawns on the queen side to launch an immediate attack on the white king also queen rook comes into play and attacks center.",

        "14. g4": "Counter Attack by g4..",
        "14... Bd6": "Preparing e5 pawn thrust to control center and increase mobility for black bishop.",
        "15. g5": "Bf4+ would be defended by Be3 on exchange of bishops black would retreat his Knight to safer square then white would launch his attack on black king by using pawn thrust h4 or Rdg1..",
        "15... Nh5": "Defending the Knight at the same time attacking the pawn with an opportunity to fork queen and bishop if white saves the pawn. Clearly Black has the upper hand over here I admit that black could have easily won by taking my light colored Bishop on e2. Again with two Bishops advantage over Knight and a Bishop along with good center control...!!",
        "16. Rdg1": "No other option but to guard the falling g-pawn. Rdg1 and not h4 since g3 then becomes vulnerable point for white where black's Knight can easily exploit.",

        "18. Bf2 Bb4 19. Qd1 d4": "Slight alteration to black's move He played d4 which is not a good move since it gives White Knight an Outpost on e4! and did not take my Bishop on e2 which was again wrong option.",

        "29... Be6": "Defending Bishop and attacking the rook at the same time!",
        "30. Rxf4": "Rxf4! I thought Knight on f4 was the active piece for Black which was attacking and defending the position at the same time so eliminating the active piece at once.. again Nf6+ is still ON..",
        "30... exf4": "takes the rook with winning confidence.. White is a piece down!",
        "31. Qh4": "Qh4! again with brilliant attacking combination and a tactical move against Black's King.. Idea Nf6+ followed by Bc3 and Qh6 with Mate Net..",
        "31... Bf5": "Trying to eliminate the knight.. If Knight moves d2+ is ON. But still its problem for black to save the King-side from strong attack by Knight Rook Queen and Bishop since all the white pieces are actively attacking the black's king. Time for an attack!!",
        "32. Nf6+": "Perfect Move in the tough situation. Pawn takes Knight is forced since white can equalize the situation with Nxe8.. ",
        "32... gxf6 33. gxf6": "Threat is Qh6! and Qg7#.. Can Black Stop it?? Answer is NO he can't!",
