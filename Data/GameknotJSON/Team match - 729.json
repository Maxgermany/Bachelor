        "10. Qxf3 h5": "You should only play this move if there is a pawn or piece on g3 to attack. Alternatively, it can support the advance of your knight to g4, but that wouldn't achieve anything in this position. The best move was 0-0, or, if you were feeling adventurous, 10...Qd7 followed by 0-0-0.",
        "11. d4": "If White had a rook on d1 this would be a good move!",
        "11... exd4": "If that rook had been on d1, it would be better not to capture.",
        "12. exd4 Nxd4 13. Qd3 c5": "This is the move that lost you the game! It weakens your d-pawn, providing an easy target for White's heavy pieces. Better to move the knight immediately.",
        "14. c3 Nc6 15. Qg3": "Targeting both your weak pawns.",
        "15... g6": "15...0-0 may be better, but that weak pawn on d6 is still a problem. Try to avoid backward pawns on open files.",
        "16. Rad1 Nxe4": "You could have tried 16...0-0 or 16...Qe7, but I think White is winning whatever you do.",
