        "1. e4": "In this game I win quickly with a standard sacrifice - however I found out during analysis that it is not sound!",
        "1... e6": "He plays the French Defence. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence",
        "2. d4": "I didn't really want to play in this match, but a player dropped out a few days before.",
        "2... d5": "It was in Division 3 of the Chester & District Chess League.",
        "3. Nc3": "This is the main line.",
        "3... Bb4": "This is the Winawer Variation. Black pins the Nc3 and threatens d5xe4. It is named after Szymon Winawer and pioneered by Nimzowitsch and Botvinnik",
        "4. e5": "The normal reply,  gaining space and hoping to show that Black's b4-bishop is misplaced.",
        "4... c5": "The usual move.",
        "5. a3": "Also usual, play normally continues Bxc3+ 6. bxc3, but...",
        "5... cxd4": "My book on The French Defence, by Glogoric, Uhlmann, Botvinnik and Karpov says that this move has \"almost disappeared from tournament practice\". ",
        "6. axb4": "So I take.",
        "6... dxc3": "He takes back.",
        "7. bxc3": "I took back, almost without thinking. My book mentions 7. Nf3 or 7. Qg4 as the usual moves here, but to me this simply recapture looked normal. Using an opening database, I see that those two moves are more popular, but don't necessarily score better.",
        "7... Qc7": "This is the drawback with the move - black goes a pawn up anyway. However white has enough compensation.",
        "8. Nf3": "The most popular move, but I found out later that 8. f4 scores better. I wanted to get on with my development.",
        "8... Qxc3+": "So he took.",
        "9. Bd2": "The only move on my opening databases.",
        "9... Qc7": "The queen drops back. Again the only move in my databases.",
        "10. Bd3": "I continue to develop. I have compensation for the pawn in better development, and a lovely half open a file.",
        "10... Ne7": "He develops too.",
        "11. O-O": "I castle.",
        "11... O-O": "He follows suit, but at the time I thought it was a mistake.",
        "12. Bxh7+": "In the 14 games on Gameknot that this position was reached, only one game featured this standard sacrifice - gtemple (2061) vs. serj_md (1789) Started: 02-Sep-13, Ended: 26-Sep-13. My version of Fritz prefers 12. Re1, we will see why soon.",
        "12... Kxh7": "He takes. I thought at the time 12....Kh8 was the only way to continue, after all as he was  pawn up before, he is still level on material. I was wrong.",
        "13. Ng5+": "I throw in a check. Now what we both missed at the time was 13....Kg8 14. Qh5 (threatening mate on h7) Qxc2! and black covers the mating square h7, with advantage to black!",
        "13... Kg6": "Luckily for me, he tries this. ",
        "14. Qg4": "With the threat of mate with 15. Nxe6 Kh7 16. Qxg7. Fritz thinks 14.....f5 is best, when 15. Qh4 leads to a advantage of plus 2.88 to white, although I would have been tempted by the simpler f5\n15.\tNxe6+\tfxg4\n16.\tNxc7\tfollowed by Nxa8.",
        "14... Nf5": "He tries this, which saves his king (at least in the short term)",
        "15. Nxe6+": "But not his queen. Black resigns. Thank you for reading, please leave a comment or two and rate my annotation on the star system. Until next time dear reader!"
