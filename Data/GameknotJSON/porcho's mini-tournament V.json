        "1. d4 d5 2. e3 Nc6 3. c4": "This was the start of the themed mini tournament.",
        "3... e6": "I rather like this more than playing Nf6!? Because if he captures on d5 and I recapture with the knight, not only do I not have very much central control, but he can gain a tempo by advancing his e pawn.",
        "4. a3": "?! Wasted move, as it does is prevents my DSB from going to b4, which wouldn't be a big problem for him.",
        "4... Bd6 5. cxd5 exd5": "I'm not sure I liked that exchange for white. It did trade a side pawn for a center one, but it allows my to develop my LSB.",
        "6. Bd2 Bd7": "This seemed to be the natural spot to put it, does anyone have any opinions where I should have moved it?",
        "7. b4": "Maybe a little too early to do this. I'm not going to castle queenside now.",
        "7... Nf6 8. b5 Ne7": "I think black is a little better now. Black has all his minor pieces out, white has one. Also,white has that b pawn strung out way ahead of the a pawn which is backward.",
        "9. Nc3 O-O": "I castle. I am going to try to get my pieces more active, and press me opponent for not developing.",
        "10. f3": "This isn't a *Terrible* move as it takes away a nice outpost for me on e4, but I would class it as an inaccuracy because it's weakening and he could just take my knight with his should it decide to sit on e4.",
        "10... Nf5 11. a4": "?! I'm not sure what he's doing with those queenside pawns, but he needs to develop.",
        "11... Qe7": "Threatens to win his e pawn.",
        "12. Qb3": "Well... development but at the wrong time.",
        "12... Nxe3 13. Bxe3 Qxe3+": "Wham! suddenly my queen appears looming over the WK",
        "14. Be2 Rfe8": "Adds more pressure",
        "15. Nh3": "?! It develops it but I can take it and split up his pawns at the same time. I think he should have waited for a better time to do this.",
        "15... c5": "His knight's not really going anywhere, so I thought I'd play this first.",
        "16. Qc2": "?! allows me to win a pawn and remove a defender of the bishop.",
        "16... cxd4 17. Kf1": "? He overlooks his knight in an attempt to get his king to safety.",
        "17... Bxh3": "I can safely split his pawns before I take his knight.",
        "18. gxh3 dxc3 19. Rd1 Bc5": "Threatens checkmate",
        "20. Bd3": "Deals with it, but allows mate in two. ",
        "20... Qxf3+ 21. Qf2 Qxf2#": "Checkmate! Please comment and rate."
