        "3. Nf3": "so this is practically forced...",
        "3... Bg4": "not many options here: White could try d3, g3, or just get this over with...",

        "6. g4 h6": "against g5, also introducing Nh7...",
        "7. Bc4": "White needs to castle: this also hinders d6-d5...",
        "7... g5": "an unexpected move: but White has to react in some way; losing f4 is not a real option, and also fxe5 and fxg5 look shady...",
        "8. f5": "so we play this: this makes Blacks' position impenetrable for now, probably the reason he played this; it also opens up the DSB diagonal, after playing the d-pawn......",
        "8... Nc6 9. c3 Bg7 10. d3": "at this point both players have to decide, whether to castle long or short...",
        "10... a6": "here is a clue for White: Black is preparing b5, and take actions on the Queens' wing...",
        "11. Be3 Na5": "giving Bc4  no means of escape: after c6, the Bishop gets trapped...",
        "12. Nd2": "making the most of it: the Knight can recapture at c4 or b3; also development...",
        "12... b5": "losing no time: Bd5 is not an option after c6...",
        "13. Bb3": "so this is forced...",
        "13... Nc6": "very clever: now, the a-pawn will march: and Bd5 remains useless...",
        "14. d4": "but there is something to be done...",
        "14... exd4": "Black can not allow d4-d5...",

        "23... Bc5": "I would have played Bg7...",

        "32... Bd6": "disrupting the rooks coordination for now, but this is mainly to cover against Rxc7+: maybe Black should have considered h4 or hxg5...",
        "33. g5": "R1xd6 will not work: there is no direct mate, so we open up a new front; first, get the g-pawn covered...",
