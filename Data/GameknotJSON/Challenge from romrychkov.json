        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6": "I wouldn't prefer this opening. You block your bishop and get little development.",
        "3. d4": "Attacking the center before he is allowed to develop.",
        "3... exd4 4. Nxd4 a6": "Not a good move. It doesn't really do anything right now, and he still hasn't developed. Better was Nf6 or Nc6.",
        "5. Nc3 g6": "An okay move. But you know the saying, \"Knights before bishops\".",
        "6. a4": "I want to go Bc4, and this prevents b5. I still think I should have done something else, suppose Bf4 or f4.",
        "6... Bg7 7. Bc4": "Got what I wanted.",
        "7... c5": "Trying to get me a double pawn stack up. I found a move to prevent it.",
        "8. Nde2 Bxc3+": "Not a good move. He doesn't get me doubled pawns, and he has a whole where his bishop used to be. And as a quote, \"I would give up if I lose my bishop when in a fiancheto.\"  ",
        "9. Nxc3 Nf6 10. Bg5": "Pinning his knight.",
        "10... h6": "Not so great. I found a move after this one, that wins a pawn.",
        "11. Bf4 O-O": "Not a good move! He loses the pawn on h6.",
        "12. Bxh6": "I took this one first, because he could defend this one, but he still can't defend the one on d6. I'll get that one later.",
        "12... Re8 13. O-O": "I figured I could lose that pawn, and attack.",
        "13... Nxe4 14. Nxe4 Rxe4 15. Qf3": "Terrible blunder I did!!!! I miscalculated!!!! I immediately thought I was going to lose. I had to decide if either Qd5 or Qf3 and I got off topic!!! Qd5, a total win. Qf3, a total loss.",
        "15... Rxc4 16. Rfe1": "Trying to think of something. The only advantage I have is hat I have a bishop on h6 and he hasn't really developed.",
        "16... Nc6": "He started developing.",
        "17. Re3": "Trying to double my rooks.",
        "17... Rxc2": "Screw the pawn!!!! I need a plan!!",
        "18. Rae1 Ne5": "Nice move.",
        "19. Re3xe5": "I am so desperate to take the e file. Rawrrrrrrr!!!!!",
        "19... dxe5 20. Rxe5": "He can't back rank mate me. I'm fine.",
        "20... Rxb2": "Taking a pawn and threatening mate on b1.",
        "21. h3": "Making a hole.",
        "21... Rb1+": "Don't know why he did this.",
        "22. Kh2 Be6 23. Qe4": "I have a plan. If he doesn't move right now, I take the bishop, and he can't take back otherwise mate on g6. Also attacking the rook on b1.",
        "23... Rb4": "Noticing the plan, and the attack on the rook.",
        "24. Qc2": "I still want to keep on attacking the g6 pawn.",
        "24... Rc4": "Trying to block.",
        "25. Qb2": "Another diagonal moving my rook will threaten mate.",
        "25... Qd6": "Making a pin.",
        "26. f4 Qe7": "This move was a little too risky. I could come up with something. I can't take the bishop, then he takes it back with the pawn and his queen is protecting g7.",
        "27. Rf5": "This stops f6.",
        "27... Rd4": "A great move.",
        "28. Bg5": "Trying something out.",
        "28... Qd7 29. Rxc5": "Taking a pawn. He can't move the rook otherwise I'll mate.",

        "30... Bxg2": "Another move I missed. I have to defend the threat of Qh3.",
        "31. Rc3": "Blocking the h3 threat. I feel like giving up.",
        "31... Qh3+": "And wow. I can't believe he blundered. Now I won.",
        "32. Rxh3": "He can't take the rook, or I'll take his.",
        "32... Rad8": "Defending the rook.",
        "33. Rd3": "Rd3, and I finished him off. He cant take it, or move it, or defend it, because then i give him a mate. Hope you all enjoyed this game, and please rate it. Thank you!!"
