        "2... c6 3. e4 g6": "White has more developed active pieces while black is very under-developed.",
        "4. d3 Qf6 5. e5": "This move was used more as a ploy to drive away the black queen. It however turned to make things very unpleasant for black.",
        "5... Qf5 6. d4 Ne7 7. Bg5": "This may be the best move of this game for black. The move attacks the knight and threatens to penetrate the black defence threatening the black bishop and the black rook.",

        "8... Rh7 9. h3 Nd5 10. Bd3": "Now we try to drive away the black queen. She has very few options now and is about to be boxed in.",
