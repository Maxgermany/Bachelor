    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "i am not very sure about what openings are called but i do know how to play, so here is my annotate...... As always i start out with d4 or c4 to play the English opening, but in this case i did d4",
        "1... Nf6": "Black responds with Nf6, standard move played by black",
        "2. c4": "regardless of blacks first move i usually follow up d4 with c4 unless black plays c5 which people have done in some occasions",
        "2... e5": "A gambit by black so he can be able to develop his pieces faster if i decide to take e5",
        "3. dxe5": "The reason i decide to do Dxe5 is because i know in the long run he will be able to get e5 back if he is indeed a good player but because i dont really like pushing d4 to d5 or play e3 to exchange pawns",
        "3... Ne4": "Usually some people would play Ng4 to attack e pawn which if i defend with Nf3, the opponent then usually plays Nc6, but in this case my opponent plays Ne4 ",
        "4. e3": "I decide to push my e pawn in this game to protect my c pawn from attacks further along in the game",
        "4... Bb4+": "Bd2 seem the best option in this case",
        "5. Bd2 Nxd2 6. Nxd2 Nc6": "Now my opponent attacks my e pawn",
        "7. Ngf3": "I defend as usual with Nf3 but i know in the long run that its pointless to defend that pawn much further",
        "7... Qe7": "Attacking the e pawn as suspected",
        "8. a3": "Making him force to take the knight.... Ba5 or Bc5 leads to him losing the Bishop... although i had thought about this beforehand if my opponent had decide to play Bc5 i would push my pawn from b2 to b4 attacking bishop, but i was afraid if he took e3 weakening my king side i would be up plus 2 but both my king side and queen side are both heavily damaged.... After Bxe3, fxe3, Nxe5 i feel i am under a lot of pressure although my opponent doesn't have any other develop pieces",
        "8... Bxd2+": "As i hoped",
        "9. Qxd2": "recapturing with the Knight wasn't very appealing, because of the b2 pawn",

        "11... d6 12. O-O O-O 13. Bf3": "just so my opponent couldn't push the b pawn, and puts my Bishop in a better position than it was",
        "13... Bd7": "I couldn't play Bxb7 because of Rah8 if i defend with Qb4 then my opponent wins a piece by playing Bc6, if i decide to take the pawn and move my bishop back to f3 after my opponent plays Rab8 i lose the B2 pawn and my queen is under attack while having a weak c4 pawn",
        "14. b4": "so i play b4 if my opponent misses the move of Bxb7 i win a pawn",
        "14... Bc6": "here i was wondering why have double pawns in the c file of course Rab8 was something i may have played maybe not, but i took the Bishop thinking i had a better set-up....",
        "15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. Rad1": "i wasn't really sure what to do here so decided that i don't want him to push d6",
        "16... a5": "this move here a7 to a5 i decided that this will determine whether i win or lose, not sure what was going through my mind but i wanted queens off the board rather than Bxa5 which weakens both my c pawn and a pawn",
        "17. Qd4 Qxd4 18. Rxd4": "now any mistake could lose either of use the game",
        "18... axb4 19. axb4": "i knew i could defend the b4 pawn that's why i let him take....",
        "19... Ra4 20. c5": "if my opponent decides to take c5 with his pawn, i reply back with bxc5 and if my opponent swaps off rooks i knew i am in a better advantage because he has two double pawns in the c file ",

        "30... g6 31. c7": "i was hoping for Kd7 so i could win the h8 pawn and still be a pawn up",
        "31... Kf6": "when this move happen i missed the next move which should of been Rh7 because the c7 pawn was already lost unless my opponent made a huge error... if i played Rh8 my opponent had to take pawn because i would promote next move leaving me to take the h pawn",

        "47... Kf6 48. g4": "i thought that he had to play hxg4 forgetting about enpassat if my opponent play hxg4 white would win the game by playing Kxg4 threatening his f pawn which would inevitable be lost  ",
