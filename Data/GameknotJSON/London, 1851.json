    "moves": {
        "1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4": "As I think, the King's Gambit was a popular opening during the 19th century.",
        "3. Bc4": "If I played, I prefer 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Bc4, because it avoids the annoying 3...Qh4+.",
        "3... Qh4+ 4. Kf1 b5": "What was that? I think that Kieseritsky tried to activate the light squared bishop on a6-f1 diagonal by some moves later, where the white King was.",
        "5. Bxb5": "As I think, 5.Nf3 followed by 6.Bb3 and 7.d3 (or d4 if possible) will give white a better control over the center. On the other hand, it was recapturing the pawn he offered in the second move.",
        "5... Nf6": "Getting the control over the center is very important while it was attacking the pawn on e4.",
        "6. Nf3": "Developing a horse, while attacking to the Queen, but 3.Nf3 is better according to me.",
        "6... Qh6 7. d3 Nh5": "Black was trying to a breakthrough with 8...Ng3+. According to my opinion, it is better not to move the same piece in the opening moves, I like 7...c6 here.",
        "8. Nh4 Qg5": "The queen was threatening to both the bishop and the horse. 9.Nf5 would stop that for a while.",
        "9. Nf5": "It was the only way to protect both pieces.",
        "9... c6": "Trying to create some space for the light squared bishop as well as a pawn moves towards the center.",
        "10. g4": "An aggressive counterattack! Black could easily cut the bishop and there will be a huge blank squares around the white king. Because the king has been moved, it would be not difficult to launch an attack from the kingside.",
        "10... Nf6 11. Rg1": "Anderssen was ignoring the piece and trying to attack the queen.",
        "11... cxb5 12. h4": "12...Qg6 is forced.",
        "12... Qg6 13. h5": "Again he was forcing 13.Qg5.",
        "13... Qg5 14. Qf3 Ng8": "He had to move the horse, otherwise the Queen is trapped with 15.Bxf4. It had no better place than its home square.",
        "15. Bxf4 Qf6": "Black was threatening 16.Qxb2 followed by capturing the trapped rook.",
        "16. Nc3": "It stopped the threat but 16...b4 would force to move the same knight again.",
        "16... Bc5": "It was taking the control over the a7-g1 diagonal, while attacking to the rook on g1.",
        "17. Nd5": "He was giving up both the pawn and the rook, but, can you see how smoothly the white pieces come towards the black king? ",
        "17... Qxb2 18. Bd6 Qxa1+": "By this move, anyone can obviously see that black was becoming very greedy to obtain the rooks without offering anything.",
        "19. Ke2 Bxg1": "19...Qxg1 would not be as vulnerable as 19...Bxg1 as I see, because Bc5 was exerting pressure on Bd6.",
        "20. e5 Na6": "I would not like that move, because white would do 20.Nc7+, if only he was badly needing the rook. And it was a blunder and a mate in 3 for white. Can you locate it?",
        "21. Nxg7+ Kd8": "There was no other possible moves.",
        "22. Qf6+": "All the thing needed to Anderssen was a CHECK as the black king's squares were attacked by the knights..",
        "22... Nxf6": "Willingly or not, black had to capture it or to put 22.Ne7. Both are a mate in next move.",
        "23. Be7#": "Though White was 21 points down, the game was ended in favor of White."
