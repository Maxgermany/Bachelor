        "25. Rxa5": "Somehow my plan became truth! But the game was at his hands!",
        "25... Kc3": "I think with that movement lost the game!!! i mean Rb1 would be a thousand times better!!! And also i still don't why he hasn't protected his knight!!! Until that moment he had the control of this game but now i won't let him win!",
        "26. Rxa3+": "Of course i take advantage of his previous mistake!",
