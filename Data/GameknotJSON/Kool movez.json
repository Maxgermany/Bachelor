        "1... e5": "I counterattack by using my bishop. (Just kidding! Its actually my knight!)",
        "2. Nf3": "This early mistake here will cost my enemy dearly. Taking his knight out early increases the chance of a left-mate-pin, also commonly known as 'fmoodle-smong'. ",
        "2... Bc5": "Here I have set up the 'donkey formation', a subtle but overhwelming opening in its own right. Few can defend against its brutal simplicity. ",
        "3. Bc4": "Another silly mistake here. Just silly. Silly silly silly. ",
        "3... c6": "Here you can see the potential of triple-check. Checkity. ",
        "4. Nxe5 Qh4": "A fluid, beautifully timed move. The pentagonal formation created by the bishop-hook is unmistakable. ",
        "5. O-O Bd6 6. g3 Bxe5": "A fork! (Or maybe a spoon, I'm not quite sure...)",
        "7. gxh4": "Here white plays very badly... a rookie mistake that has ensured his own brutal demise. ",
        "7... Nh6 8. d4 Bf6": "I learnt three things from this move:\n\n1. Noodles are yummy. 2. I can't count. ",
        "9. Qh5 Bxd4 10. Bxh6": "Another mistake here. A meaningless tactic that will accomplish nothing. ",
        "10... Bxb2": "Bwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha *snort* ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! (also, a spork)",
        "11. Qxf7+ Kd8 12. Bxg7 Re8 13. Bxb2": "You can see here how novice my opponent is. Imbecilic and featherbrained moves like these only serve to accentuate his inane and immaturity. It also opens up the right flank-fmoddle. Or something. ",
        "13... d6 14. Bf6+ Re7 15. Qxe7#": "Another silly mistake, utterly useless- oh wait, its checkmate. No matter. \n\n"
