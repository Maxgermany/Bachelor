        "29. Rc1 a1=Q": "this is the game deciding move right here, i can kill the queen and make the game knight and bishop vrs 2 rooks or i can kill the rook and make it rook and bishop vrs queen and rook. i know that killing the queen is the better move but i do not see any mates with one knight or bishop i also notice his king is still subject to back rank mate ideas, i need a rook for those to work so that made my decision",
