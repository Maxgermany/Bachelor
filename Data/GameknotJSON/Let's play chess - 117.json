        "5... Bg7": "fianchetoing the bishop",
        "6. g4": "preparing a pawn storm, as black will probably castle kingside but weakening white's right wing.\nBut it seriously weakens the king if white opts for short castling.",
        "6... O-O 7. Bg2": "2 pawns on d4 and e4, to occupy the center is strong but easy to attack for black, they have to be protected.",
        "7... e5": "Here comes the attack, maybe to soon (black has a knight and a bishop still in their garage)",

        "10. exd5 Nxd5 11. Nxd5 cxd5": "OK, the trade is over ! White's knight can hardly be fired. White has developpement advance but has not castled and his king is weak.",
        "12. c3": "to reinforce the knight and, more important, to avoid him to move by interposing between the b2 pawn and the fianchetoed bishop",
        "12... Nc6 13. Nxc6": "Maybe a mistake Nb3 might ahve been better",
        "13... bxc6": "This reinforces the black central pawn",
        "14. O-O": "Mistake, the first idea of white was to castle long but after 12. c3 I thought it was a bad plan",
        "14... f5": "Black has the initiative. This move weakens the black king but with the pawns on d5 and c6, black prevents white attack by the a6 f1 diagonal.",
        "15. f3": "Doubtfull move, it weakens the king, blocks the g2 bishop and the DSB is no longer protected.",
        "15... Re8": "Obvious move.",
        "16. Re1": "Blunder ! Bf2 would have been better. Re1 was playable later to challenge the open file.",

        "22. Rb1": "menacing the black queen",
        "22... axb4 23. Rxb4": "The black king is isolated. If black doesn't pay enough attention, some counter may be possible.",
        "23... Qa7 24. Bf1": "setting the bishop in an open diagonal, to give it mobility",
        "24... c5": "One option for black is indeed to get a passed pawn and bring it to promotion, which would force white to sacrifice queen or rook.",
        "25. Rb5": "Not much choice. It offers the a4 pawn whichh is anyway condemned",
        "25... Qxa4 26. c4": "Openning a diagonal for the queen (looking for material euality in the exchanges has little point now. All that white can expect is an opportunity to launch a raid toward the black king. More chances to have this opportunity if white's pieces are more mobile.
