        "1. e4": "I started off with intentions to open up the d-file.",
        "1... e5": "He responded with e5, a common opening move.",
        "2. Nf3": "I protected my future pawn placement and began with a three or four knight opening.",
        "2... Nc6": "He protected the piece that I was threatening.",
        "3. d4": "I stopped congestion of the queen. Best to get this out of the way, for my future plans will need it. Also, I threatened the pawn- now with 2 pieces. Not leaving my pawn en prise however.",
        "3... exd4": "He took the bait...I mean piece...as I planned out my next move.",
        "4. Nxd4": "I traded off and took his pawn in revenge.",
        "4... Nxd4": "He then took my knight with his. It took me long to understand that at this point my queen could still attack him. It also helped my plan greatly.",
        "5. Qxd4": "I took him without a second glance.",
        "5... b6": "He moved out. A move I saw coming. He was planning on taking me with his Dark Squared Bishop.",

        "6... Bc5": "As if I predicted the future, he attacked.",
        "7. Qd2": "I easily defended, staying off the back line to keep my plan intact.",
        "7... Nf6": "He developed his knight nonthreatening.",
        "8. Na3": "I developed mine in return. Serving a double purpose, also opening my rook. A better move would have been to develop towards the center, however. Still, though, I opened outside, taking the enemies DSB (dark squared bishop) out of play for the future.",
        "8... Bxa3": "Gone, he performed a trade and it was off the board.",
        "9. bxa3": "I decided this would be okay. Although the b-file was open, it was not going to be a large threat.",
        "9... Nxe4": "He put my queen in danger and I had to act.",
        "10. Qd3": "Still remaining off the back line, my plan was in motion. My next mission was to remove his d-pawn.",
        "10... Nc5": "His knight threatening me yet again, I was in danger.",
        "11. Qd2": "Back to the running block, I returned to original position.",
        "11... Nb3": "Forking my Rook and queen, I knew i was in trouble.",
        "12. Rd1": "I pulled my rook, in any other case, a queen would be necessary, however for this, I needed that rook. ",
        "12... d5": "Crucial mistake, not noticing. He pulled his d-pawn out.",
        "13. Bc4": "I threatened his knight, actually in an attempt to move the d-pawn.",
        "13... dxc4": "Blunder, he took the bishop not the queen. Oblivious, he lost himself the game.",
        "14. Qxd8#": "Checkmate. I took his unprotected queen and he had nowhere to go. Good game Millionaire, if you had noticed that, it would have gone differently. Good game. Thanks everyone, hope you enjoyed. Stay tuned for the next one."
