        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "One of my favorite opening systems. Follows simple + logical moves that make chess look easy. ",
        "3... a6": "most common move but most popular at top levels is avoiding assisting white with his plans for the LSB is 3...Nf6 which most likely leads to the solid berlin. ",
        "4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3": "old main line that avoids immediate tactics in favor for slow middle game build up. Don't let the position fool you white usually ends up having a very good game outside the berlin walls. This is one of the made reason why most top players prefer the berlin. ",
        "5... b5": "kicking the bishop to the desirable a2-g8 diagonal where it hits at the weak f7. ",
        "6. Bb3 Be7": "Ideal, also playable is ...g6 and ...Bb7 and ...d6",
        "7. c3": "at some point white would love to play d4-d5 with a powerful wedge. However, white often never gets to that point. The other point is to provide a escape hatch for the LSB. ",
        "7... d6 8. Nbd2": "The world famous thematic move that is almost always played in this system for white. the knight is going to c4; e3 or g3. ",
        "8... O-O 9. Bc2 d5": "black has to get d5 in at some point quickly before white is completely developed or he will feel the pain. ",
        "10. O-O Bg4": "So why not 10...dxe4? why the short answer is that there is nothing wrong with 10...dxe4. However, the exchange releases much of the tension in the position leaving it devoid of much to play for. By the way I have never seen 10...Bg4 before. ",
        "11. h3": "Putting the question on the bishop and gaining small space on the king side. ",
        "11... Bh5 12. Re1": "Developing the rook, supporting e4 and preparing for Nf1",
        "12... Qd7 13. Nf1": "dooms e4 but gains powerful potential on the king side. ",
        "13... dxe4 14. dxe4 Qxd1 15. Bxd1 Rad8": "The position is statically equal but as with all Roy Lopez thing can be deceiving. White has better coordination and pawn structure. Plus is center is slight more stable. ",
        "16. Ng3 Bg6 17. Bc2": "defending e4 and preparing for Nh5. ",
        "17... Bc5 18. b4": "gaining space and challenging the bishop forcing to go inside the cave of b6. ",
        "18... Bb6 19. Be3": "not a fan of this move. A possible improvement maybe 19. a4. ",
        "19... Bxe3 20. Rxe3 Nd7": "heading for c4?",
        "21. Nh4 Rdb8": "why not the simple 21...Nb6?",
        "22. a4 Rfd8 23. Nf1": "I want to play g4 kick starting a king side attack. ",
        "23... Nf6 24. Nxg6 hxg6 25. Nh2": "looks like white left his back end exposed. ",
        "25... Rd2 26. axb5 axb5 27. Bd3": "!! the rooks are shutdown and black is a dead duck floating feet up. ",
        "27... Nh5 28. Nf3 Rb2 29. Ra6": "omg I can be so mean!",
        "29... Nd8 30. Nxe5": "winning a pawn. ",
        "30... Nf6 31. g3": "slow march begins. ",
        "31... Ne6": "and this is why I played g3. ",
        "32. Nxg6": "wins another pawn. ",
        "32... fxg6 33. Rxe6": "and black resigns as my pawns will win. "
