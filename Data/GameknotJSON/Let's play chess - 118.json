        "1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bf4": "This is a typical way to make it more difficult for Black to accomplish e5.",
        "3... Bg4 4. e3 Bxf3": "It's relatively unusual for Black to exchange B for N here.  It allows White a tempo (which can be recovered with Nb4).",
        "5. Qxf3 a6 6. a3": "This prevents Nb4.",
        "6... Qd7": "Black signals intention to castle Queenside.",
        "7. c4 e6 8. Nc3 O-O-O 9. cxd5": "This capture allows White to open the c-file against the castled position of Black's K.",
        "9... exd5 10. Bd3 Kb8 11. O-O f6 12. Bg3 Nge7": "This move surprised me.  I expected Bd6 to trade off the defender of White's K.  Instead, a piece gets blocked in.",
        "13. Rfc1 h5 14. h3 Na5": "Threatening Nb3.",
        "15. Qd1 Nf5": "White is at a crossroads.  16. Bxf5 Qxf5 gives Black good chances with a Kingside attack.  On the plus side for White, Black's Na5 is misplaced and the Rh8 and the Bf8 are not even developed yet.  I decided that getting the c-file open against the Black K, getting the initiative, and turning the d pawn into a passed pawn were positional plusses that were worth the material deficit of trading a B for two pawns.",
        "16. Bxc7+ Kxc7 17. Nxd5+ Kb8 18. Nc3 Nd6 19. b4 Nac4 20. Qc2 Nb6": "This surprised me.  I expected b5, although that position isn't very comfortable either after a4.",
        "21. a4 Rc8 22. b5 axb5 23. axb5 Nxb5 24. Bxb5 Qxb5": "This surprised me too, as it leads to White picking up a material advantage.",
        "25. Nxb5 Rxc2 26. Rxc2": "Now White has opened Black's King position, the Rooks are on open files, and Black still has two undeveloped pieces.  White has a material advantage and a positional advantage.",
        "26... Nd5 27. Rca2": "Threatening Ra8#.",
        "27... b6 28. Ra2a8+ Kb7 29. Nd6+ Bxd6": "This surprised me too, as it leads to a larger material deficit.",
        "30. Rxh8 g6 31. Rh7+ Kc6 32. Rc1+ Kb5 33. Rd7": "Rd7 skewers the B and N, gaining more material.",
        "33... Nxe3 34. fxe3 Bg3 35. d5 f5 36. Rg7": "Targeting a pawn that cannot be protected.",
        "36... f4 37. Rxg6 h4 38. Rxg3": "This simplifies the endgame significantly.  Regardless of how Black recaptures, the passed pawn on the d-file, created back on move 16, is going to sail in.  White's R on the c-file prevents the K from getting to the pawn.",
        "38... fxg3 39. d6": "Black resigned here as the passed pawn will be decisive."
