    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "A team match. I'm white and open with my king pawn.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3": "Black chose the Sicilian. Not too surprising, actually.",
        "2... d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3": "All fairly normal, I'd say.",
        "5... e5 6. Bb5+": "Black looked to be heading for the Dragon, then diverted with 6. e5. I leave my knight en prise to develop my bishop with check, preparing to castle.",
        "6... Bd7 7. Bxd7+ Qxd7 8. Nde2": "I played to e2 thinking it leaves my f-pawn free to roam and attack the center, should I desire to do so.",
        "8... Be7 9. O-O O-O 10. Ng3": "I'm thinking f5 looks like a good square for a knight, especially with a bishop and queen both aiming down their diagonals toward the castled enemy king.",
        "10... Nc6 11. Nf5": "Now this looks like fun. Possibilities of pressure on the d6 pawn, as well as getting my queen to g3.",
        "11... Bd8 12. Nxd6": "Hmmm, I guess black didn't want me to exchange my knight for his bishop. I feel that exchange would have been weak for white. As played, the bishop was crucial to black's defense of the d6 pawn. The defender removed, I see no reason to show mercy.",
        "12... Bb6 13. Bg5 Rad8 14. Nc4": "Black added a piece to support his attack against my knight on d6. Moving the knight will allow black to trade queens, but I am OK with that since I'm a pawn ahead. F5 was tempting, but I chose c4 because I'm considering the havoc I can play against black's pawn structure if he'll let the knight exchange for the bishop on b6.",
        "14... Qe6 15. Nd5": "Since the black knight on f6 is pinned, I see a chance to wreck pawn structure on both sides, or maybe just win a pawn on b6, depending on how black plays.",
        "15... Nxe4 16. Bxd8": "What I didn't expect black to do was willing give up the exchange. I guess he thought he could recover the material or compensate somehow.",
        "16... Rxd8 17. Ncxb6 axb6 18. c4": "Pawn structure damage as planned, now to rescue the beleagured knight.",
        "18... b5 19. b3 bxc4 20. bxc4": "Now my own pawn structure doesn't look too great. And my knight is still pinned.",
        "20... b5 21. Qe2": "I thought I had it all worked out. I am now threatening to win black's knight on e4 and also to win the pawn on b5: If 21. ... Nf6, 22. Nxf6  followed by 23. Pxb5. Or if 21. ... Ng5, 22. Pxb5 and now black can choose to exchange knights or allow both knights to run to safety. ",
        "21... f5 22. Rfd1": "This was probably a mistake on my part. I think I was better off with 22. Pxb5.",
        "22... Nd4 23. Rxd4": "I didn't see 22. ... Nd4 coming. Ouch. I really should have, since it was such a nice and obvious move. White cannot counter attack black's queen with 23. Nc7? since 23. ... Nxe2 gives check and lets black save his own queen. 23. Qd3? is met by 23. ... Pxc4 and now both the white queen and white knight are en prise and one must fall. The remaining retreats for the white queen offer no interesting attacks and allow black to play 23. ... Pxc4, recovering some of his lost material and gaining a well-supported passed pawn in the process. So I decide I am better off choosing the fashion in which I give back some of my material lead instead of letting black take it for himself as he chooses.",
        "23... bxc4 24. Rxc4": "Black had the chance to take the white rook with 23. ... Pxd4 but he chose to refuse my gift. Truth is, I am not sure I get much compensation for returning the exchange, so I'm fairly glad black refused the gift. As played, white can retain his material advantage.",
        "24... Qxd5 25. Rac1": "Double the rooks on the c-file.",
        "25... Nd6 26. Rc4c5": "I capitalize on a bit of a miscalculation by black by skewering his queen to his e5 pawn. The queen must move, and then the pawn will fall, leaving me with a winning material advantage.",
        "26... Qb7 27. Qxe5": "There. Winning edge secured, and I've gained an attack as well. I must remain ever vigilant of my back rank or this game could end in a single nasty surprise. However, pressing the attack does not give me time to create breathing room for my king, so I will have to be careful.",
        "27... Qb4 28. Qe7": "I think black was considering 28. ... Re8 which pins my queen against the empty e1 square - if I move her away then either 29. ... Re1  or 29. ... Qe1  is followed by checkmate the next move. Of course, 29. Qc3 would have prevented this checkmate, as would 29. Rc8! (29. ... Nxc8???, 30. Qxe8  ). Since black has no immediate threat, it's time to attack.",
        "28... Qb8 29. Rc5c7": "Black is doomed.",
        "29... Ne8 30. Qf7+": "And now the final position. Black resigned, one move short of checkmate after 30. ... Kh8 31. Qf8  ."
