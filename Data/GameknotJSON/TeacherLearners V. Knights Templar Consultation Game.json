Maybe to achieve a stronger hold on the center of the board.  a_random_guy: 2.c3\nThere are a lot of viable moves in this position, but I'll vote for the Alapin's variation.  ptitroque: 2.c3 yes 2.e5\ncrates an advanced pawn, difficult to defend and we move twice the same peice which is bad in the opening",
        "2. c3 Nf6": "a_random_guy:  3.e5\nThis is the main book move, anything else seems a bit dubious.  bluenoser: e5\nI was wondering about this move also? Isn't the rule nnot to move the same piece in the opening?\n\nThis is a question only, I like e5 as a move.  a_random_guy: blunoser\nTrue, there is a \"rule\" to not move the same piece in the opening. However...\n\n1.Our e pawn is attacked and is undefended right now, so we have to do something about it\n\n2.By advancing to e5, we force them to move their knight twice in the opening!  roneshet: e5\nI agree. The knight is going for a tour around the court while we advance our pawn and release him from the threat at the same time. ",

The two main moves here are 4.d4 and 4.Nf3. I'll vote for the later, but I really don't mind 4.d4 either.  bluenoser: 4.Nf3\nI agree Nf3 protecting our e5 pawn we have already pushed and making onother opening move.We will also gain our tempo back by them already moving their knight twice.  roneshet: Bc4\nMaybe we can consider moving the bishop. though, threatening the knight, preparing for casteling and taking a good stand with the bishop.  ptitroque: 4. Nf3\nMost natural move",
        "4. Nf3 Nc6": "a_random_guy: 5.Bc4\n5.d5 is also an option, but I'll vote for 5.Bc4, developping a piece and hitting their knight. bluenoser: Bc4\nI like this move as it is a good developing move, and a step away from castling king side. I usually play the g3 then Bg2. Nice to see something different played than my normal moves.  ptitroque: 5.Bc4 OK ",
        "5. Bc4 Nb6": "a_random_guy: 6.Bb3\nThere isn't much to say here, aside that we need to save the bishop somehow. 6.Bb3 keeps the bishop on the strong a2-g8 diagonal, and we can retreat it to c2 if they push c4.  roneshet: Bb5\nadvance a little bit. if they threaten our Bishop we can change pieces with their knight, setting two pawns on the same column. a tip from the Great list of tips of ptitroque.\nWe also leave the diagonal... which is a downside...\nWhat's better?  a_random_guy: @roneshet\nDon't forget that we'd also give up the bishop pair for no valuable reason in that 6.Bb5 a6 7.Bxc6 line. Doubling pawns is good and all, but non-isolated doubled pawns isn't that big of a weakness early on.  ptitroque: 6.Bb3\nSeems OK for me  bluenoser: 6.Bb5\nI was looking at Bb5...if a6 we could play BXc6 taking N and doubling up their p's on c file. If they\npush d6, we can take Nc6 doubling up p's.  ptitroque: 6.Bb3 -further analyse\nThey'll probably castle short (because of the advance of their c pawn), our bishop will be pointed at their king.\n\nDoubling pawn is a disadvantage but it would create an half open file for their rook and 2 pawns on the c file would reinforce their center, which would balance the inconvenient.",

Bc2 Qc7": "a_random_guy: 8.Qe2\nWe gotta protect that e pawn somehow...\n\n(Well, we could play 8.O-O and sacrifice that pawn for faster development, but it's not worth it in my opinion)  roneshet: d4\nI say we sacrifice o paw, but ope up the way for the BB. Than castling. I don't like the way the queen stands before the king. It's dangerous...  a_random_guy: It's not that dangerous actually\nTheir rooks are far away from entering play, we'll have a lot of time to castle away to safety by then.  ptitroque: What about 7. d4 ?\nIf they take en passant (7...c4xd3 it's not bad for us, as we'll answer by :\n8. Bxd3. We'll have developpement advance, If they take our e pawn with their knight, we can set our DSB on f4.\n\nWe'll get a very opened game but I believe that we'll be more mobile than black.  bluenoser: 8.....d4\nI think d4 looks good, we have lots of time for castling and it appears they have a few moves before they are able to castle. I like the open game that will follow for us.  ptitroque: sorry, d4 is bad for if\n1. d4 cxd3 e.p.\n2. Bxd3 Nxe5\n3. Qe2 Nxf3+\n4. Qxf3\n\nand we exchange the queens and are one pawn late. I believe a random guy idea is better.\nI vote 8. Qe2  a_random_guy: @ptiroque\n8.d4 cxd3 e.p. 9.Bxd3 Nxe5 10.Bf4?? Nxd3+ 0-1 ",

I am not concerned of about having the bishop locked in for one move. Be3 would be my second option.",

Re1\nTo protect our DSB, increase our control on the center, set our rook on the 1/2 open file e.\nMaybe they will play Nf4 to menace our queen, in which case we'll have to move our queen but at least, they won't be able to send their knight on e2  a_random_guy: 14.Rfe1\nYeah, it seems reasonable.\n\nDon't forget to indicate which piece moves, if two of the same piece type can move to the same square...  roneshet: Bd4\nit is a good position for the bishop. they can't threaten him in the next move.\nmaybe Ne4 before/after so we can attack f6 square if needed.",
        "14. Rfe1 Nxe3": "ptitroque: 15. Re3\nSeems better than taking with the queen, because the rook has to be developed and we menace to bring its brother on e1  a_random_guy: 15.Rxe3\nI agree. We're down a straight pawn with not a lot of compensation though.  bluenoser: Re3\n15. Re3 looks like our best move.  roneshet: agree Re3\ni agree. this seems the best move",

Nd5 and the Rh3 to menace mate or similar moves like Re5)\n\nWe are one pawn late but we have some developement advance and (probably not for long) we control the center.  bluenoser: 16.....b4\nI like the b4 option!  roneshet: kingside Nd4\nI like the attack option.",
        "17. b4 b5": "roneshet: Nd4\nI think we should try to move the rocks to the king side.  bluenoser: 16. Nd4\nNd4 looks like a good move to me. 16.Ne4 \nNe4 also looks like a possible move?  ptitroque: 16. Nd4\nI considered Ne5 to create a quick menace on their king (Rh3) but it doesn't seem to hold if black plays f5.\nI prefer Nd4 for it immediately frees the e3 rook for a further Rg3 or Rh3)",
        "18. Nd4": "When this was played, I somehow, got the move number mixed up which I admitted.  I said 16, but this was after the 17th move, just to avoid confusion for commentators.",

They have to defend their h7 pawn somehow.  ptitroque: 19. Rh3\nWe are in late in material, we have to create quickly a threat to keep the initiative  bluenoser: Rh3?\nWe now have our rooks in the same half open file. Rh3 is easily countered by h6.\n\nWhat about Nd2b3, aiming for Na5 threatening the B?  ptitroque: @bluenoser\nif h6 we play g4!?  bluenoser: IF we play g4 can't he simply take back with his Q?  ptitroque: @bluenoser\nThe queen is on a blck diagonal and cannot hit g4  bluenoser: Sorry, I was looking at f4 not g4, my mistake.

Rh3 f5": "roneshet: f3\nNf3, seems good enough to me.  a_random_guy: Hmmm\nWe're down a pawn, and we'd probably lose the long game, so that's why I suggest the probably bad 20.g4?! to get an attack on their king as soon as possible.  bluenoser: Nf3?...\nWe have two knights that could go to f3....which one were you thinking?\n\ng4 looks bold and daring I like it!  roneshet: Nd2f3\nI mean the d2 knight  ptitroque: 20. g4 ?!\nFor the reasons explained above; Our only chance is to attack quickly",

Qd6 we cannot afford to trade the queen.\n\nSo that our queen should come to c2 - Is it good for us ?  roneshet:  fine by me\nI think it's fine tu retreat our queen to c2.\nTheir queen is very dangerour there.  bluenoser: Qc2\nNd4e2 would chase their Q to d6 forcing us to exchange Q's or move our Q. I think we want to keep our Q on the diagonal it is now on so AGREE Qc2.  a_random_guy: What does 22.Qc2 accomplish in the first place?\nI'd suggest 22.gxf4 to close up the f file as soon as possible instead, possibly followed by 22...exf5 and 23.Re2.\n\nThis position is quite complicated...  roneshet: N4e2\nThis is my move. not Qc2...Qc2 is a sequence move.\nFxf4 seems good. although more risky...   bluenoser: 22....gxf4\nI hadn't even thought of this move. Worth considering I think.  ptitroque: 22... gxf4\nconsiderably weakens our king and we'll have 2 isolated pawns.",

If we can send it on g3, we'll menace the f5 point.  bluenoser: 23...Nf1\nLooks good to me...I really didn't see it until you pointed it out. I know you are thinking long range on this move.  a_random_guy: hmmm... 23.Re2?\nI'm not so sure about 23.Nf1, as they can easily push g6 to protect their f5 pawn. Furthermore, they could also play 23...Bc5!?, forcing some trades that would advantage them (We can't recapture the bishop on c5 immediately, as our e1 rook would be hanging. 23.Nf1 Bc5 24.bxc5 Rxe1 or 24.Rxe8 Bxd4+ 25.cxd4 Rxe8 and we're still down a pawn with our pieces awkwardly placed.)\n\nWe do want to keep our knight on d4 for as l;ong as possible, as it is well centralised and black can't challenge it with a pawn.\n\nBlack might also want to play Bf6, threatening to exchange our well placed knight. If we leave our d2 knight on d2, we'll be able to play N2b3, covering our d4 knight in a pinch. Therefore, we might not want to move our d2 knight yet.\n\nWith all that being said, I'd suggest Re2, to place our rook on a protected square if they move their dark-square bishop and to prepare Rg2, if needed.\n\n(I corrected some errors from my latest post.)",
