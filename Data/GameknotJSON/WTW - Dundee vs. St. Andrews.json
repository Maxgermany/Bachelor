        "1. e4": "I took bigpeta up on his offer to play a hybrid walking-the-walk/bigpeta-teaching-game.  This game combined the master vs below-2000-player aspect of the wtw club with a discuss-as-we-play aspect of a bigpeta teaching game.  ",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": " ",
        "3... Nd4 4. Ba4": "played 4. Ba4 instead of NxN in part to avoid black pawn coming to d4, ...black's c-pawn perhaps soon supporting on c5.  Comments?",
        "4... Nxf3+": "NxN",
        "5. Qxf3": "5. Qxf3.  I do not love bringing the queen out this early.",
        "5... Nf6 6. O-O c6 7. c3": "support for d4 to follow, but...",
        "7... d5": "7. ...d5 leads into some other concerns.",
        "8. exd5": "PxP",
        "8... Qxd5": "QxP.  not wanting to remove queens so early...",
        "9. Qe2": "9. Qe2.  bigpeta advised that 9. Qe3 would have been better, and played...",
        "9... Bg4": "9. ...Bg4",
        "10. f3": "...and did not like this disruption of my pawn structure.  I did not read this as particularly bad and so take away that it's back to the drawing board to learn more about pawns.",
        "10... Be6": "10. ...Be6",
        "11. d3": "11. d3",
        "11... O-O-O": "11. ...O-O-O.  oof! black castles to the opposite side, releasing pin of his c-pawn and putting two attackers on d3.",

        "15. d4": "15. d4",
        "15... exd4": "PxP",
        "16. cxd4": "PxP, isolating pawn.  I expect close analysis will identify losing move as being here or before.  I note that white is underdeveloped compared to black, ...the knight still on its home square being a problem and traceable to perhaps even moves 4 to 7.  I had hoped that the pawn would make a capture at some point.  And the potential for this is retained for sometime, but is finally lost at 19 (the pawn itself hanging on until 22).  Comments on game to this point?",

        "17... Qe6": "17. ...Qe6, attacking unprotected B and putting B and R on d4.  white rook does NOT protect d4 because ...Qe1#, ...knight blocking second rook still a problem.",
        "18. Qf2": "18. Qf2 supports pawn.  Pete noted that Qd2 would have been better.  I had prematurely dismissed Qd2 due to emotions winning out over reason, ...black's rook giving the appearance of a bigger problem than actually existed.  A useful lesson here is that I need to remove this problem (of emotions over clarity) from my thinking process.",
        "18... Rhe8": "18. ...Rhe8 ",

        "22... Bxd4": "...BxP.  That pawn lasted a long time but probably shouldn't have been there to begin with.",
        "23. Qxd4": "a somewhat emotional choice again.  RxB would have kept queens on the board a bit longer.  But the alignment of the R-Q-K on the diagonal looked hideous to me.",
        "23... Qxd4+ 24. Rxd4 Rxd4": "Queens gone.",
        "25. Re7": "Had black not played Rd7 next move, this had the potential to equalize.",
        "25... Rd7": "locks in blacks narrow but good enough lead.  Probably should have withdrawn rook and attempted to regroup.  Comments?",

        "28. h4": "28. h4.  Pete advised g3 was better.  I didn't love h4 but felt that g3 would be followed by 28. ...Kf5 which seemed bad.  Felt h4 might allow white to direct play to black's queenside where there was perhaps some chance.   Could white win following 27. Ke6?  Comments appreciated.",
        "28... b6 29. Ke3 Nd5+": "29. ...Nd5+.  Some danger for white's g-pawn here, so...",
        "30. Kd2": "...this ugly looking move (Kd3 losing pawn; Kd4 inviting ...c5; NxN fatally depleting my side).  ",
        "30... Nxc3": "Not that this is any better.",
