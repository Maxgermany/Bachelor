        "17... a4 18. Ba2 Bd6 19. Kh1 Ne7 20. Nc4": "After some maneuvering, I threaten to exchange off Black's remaining Bishop, which would leave me with the much better pair of minor pieces.",
        "20... Ng6 21. Nxd6 cxd6 22. Rxd6": "I gain a Pawn in the mix-up",
        "22... Ra6 23. Rxa6": "Up a pawn and with 2 B's vs. 2 Knights on an open board, I'm definitely not averse to exchanging major pieces.",

        "35... Qd4 36. Qe7": "Black could rid himself of the menacing Pawn with 36... RxP 37 QxR, but I would have a technically easy win with my piece ahead.",

        "42... Qxf2+ 43. Kh1": "With my King in the corner, I have to be careful. At a minimum Black is seeking a perpetual check for a draw, and with the Q's still on the board, it's certainly possible.",

        "51... f3 52. Qxg7+": "I'm forced to do this, since the Black KBP has cut my Q's access to KN2 on the diagonal.",
        "52... Qxg7 53. Bxg7": "Black misses a golden opportunity. 53... P-B7!!! wins at once, as I cannot stop the P from Queening. But he is blinded by greed.",
