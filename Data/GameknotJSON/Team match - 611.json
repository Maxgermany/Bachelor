        "1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6 3. c3 Nf6 4. f3 e6 5. d3 d5": "this is premature, allowing white to steer the game into a French Defense unfavorable for black.  much better was 5 ... a6",
        "6. Bb5 a6": "a difficult choice.  black decides to force white to exchange the bishop for the knight and then trade off his two resulting \"c\" pawns by ... c5 and cxd4.",
        "7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. e5 Nd7 9. f4 Be7 10. Nf3 O-O 11. O-O f6": "this typical french move doesn't turn out well for black, but what does he have here?  passive is play is not to my liking.",
        "12. d4 Qb6 13. b3 cxd4 14. cxd4 c5 15. Be3 Bb7 16. Nc3 fxe5 17. fxe5 c4": "a bold try to get something going.  White responds well, gaining a very strong position.",
        "18. Na4 Qd8 19. Qe1 cxb3 20. axb3 Bc6 21. Qg3 Bb5": "the only thing this move has going for it is that white will not be able to place a rook at f1.  white soon eliminates the possibility of a cheapo mate by playing h4.",
        "22. Bh6 Rf7 23. Rf2 Rc8 24. h4 Nf8 25. Ng5": "this required some real calculation by white which he failed to do.",
        "25... Rxf2 26. Kxf2 Ng6": "the only chance of resistance.  ",
        "27. h5": "probably 27 Nf3 needed to by played here.   the complications which result from 27 h5 allow black to escape and gain at least a draw.  ",
        "27... gxh6 28. Nxe6 Qd7 29. Nb6": "a horrible blunder.  black had reckoned on 29 either(!) knight to c5 and ... Rxc5!  i.e.\r\n\r\n29 Nec5 Rxc5 30 Nxc5 Qf5+! 31 Kg1 Qf4! allowing the knight on g6 to escape capture and producing a position which black shouldn't lose.\r\n\r\n29 Nac5 Rxc5 30 dxc5 Qxe6 31 hxg6 and now black needs to find the best move in a good position.",
        "29... Qxe6 30. Nxc8": "white's best was going in for an ending where he is two pieces down and should lose",
        "30... Bh4 31. Qxh4 Nxh4 32. Rc1 Qg4": "forcing the win rapidly",
        "33. Ne7+ Kf8 34. Rc7 Qxg2+ 35. Ke3 Qe2+": ""
