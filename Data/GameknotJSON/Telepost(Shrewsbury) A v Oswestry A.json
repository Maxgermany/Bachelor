I haven't looked closely into the earlier part of the game, but I like the strategic dichotomy of White's K-side attack vs Black's on the Q-side, especially as it persists even into the 2R + B late middle game. (Incidentally, I don't call the late play end games unless and until the number of pieces have been reduced to two or fewer.) \n\nCheers, \nIon\" (archduke_piccolo) Many thanks for reading.
