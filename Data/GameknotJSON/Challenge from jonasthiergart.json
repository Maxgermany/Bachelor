        "1. e4 d5": "My usual (will I ever change?).",
        "2. exd5": "Accepted, which is best for white but much more tactic and complicated to play...",
        "2... Nf6": "This is recommended instead of Qxd4, which leads to a \"hanging queen\" that will be easily targeted for white while developing. That's true. I still hold some hopes about the Qa5 or Qe4+ moves, but if more experienced players say they are bad... they probably are. This one seems just to gambit a pawn, because white can assure it by f4.",
        "3. Bc4": "If 13. f4 instead, black is known to have enough compensation after e6, 14. dxe6, Bxe6, followed by Bb4, Ne4 etc. White will be forced to play defensively. I expected 14. Nc3 or 14. Nf3, which allow e6 (the so-called Icelandic Gambit), a line I am experiencing with. BUT I seldom or never faced this natural move. OF course, I can just take the pawn. But this gets me out of my \"confort line\". ",
        "3... Nxd5 4. Nf3": "Incredible, but it was the first time I faced this situation. Could I have simply played Nb6? NO!, because of Bxf7+, KxB, Ne4+, with a very strong attack for the piece (still better that what came later). The right move here is Bg4 (now!), prepared to exchange it, or just e6 - provided black manages to develop his lsb on b7 or a6. ",
        "4... Nf4": "?! Counterintuitive, antideveloping, etc. I just thought that normally this move can't be played because white's dsb guards f4, and the white K is castled... but not now. Of course, this move leaves white Bxf7+, KxB, Ne5+... winning, if I remember well some good games from great players in similar positions.  ",
        "5. O-O": "White goes for the easy way. I have to stop WN jump, and I don't like f6 at all. At the same time, I was considering what would be needed to make of h3 a sac point, either for N or B. When returning into the game",
        "5... Bg4": "?? Now I can clearly see it, as I did when analyzing the position. Then, I re-opened the board and played mechanically. After the move, I realized what had I done, and... paid for the consecuences. ",
        "6. Bxf7+": "By the B move I just offered white another piece to munch after the N check. Kd7 is useless too because of Ne5+...",
        "6... Kxf7 7. Ne5+ Kg8": "Could Ke8 or Kf6 be better?",
        "8. Qxg4": "The problem for black is to prevent Qe6#... and the N is hanging!",
        "8... Qd4": "Fearing f3, planning Nh6+. Against any answer, QxN.",
        "9. Qf5": "Threatening the N and Qf7#, but allowing Ne2+. But this check is useless. Let's make room for my K. ",
        "9... h6": "? Allowing shortly ahead Ng6. ",
        "10. Nc3": "Passive, but in this situation, for white almost any move is good! This forbids Ne2+, but for black there are more urgent issues to assess. I would have gone f3 instead, followed by N4. True is that after Ne2+, Kh1, NxB, RxN, White loses his dsb but still has a better position. ",
        "10... e6": "Now that my K has an escape square, I can play this tricky move. It accomplishes a lot of things: forces white into react instead of attacking (Qf7+, Kh7, and...?). Opens the way for the dsb. Cuts white's support of d7 (so my N can came out). About countermoves: if Nb5, Qb6, QxN, QxN. ",
        "11. Qf7+": "\"As you wish, Sir...\"",
        "11... Kh7 12. d3": "Nf3 could go now e4-f6#. I thought that the \"natural\" Nd5 just loses to Ng6 or Qxe6, so I had to find something else: ",
        "12... Bd6": "The plan is to recover my N with his, unravel a little my pieces, and force white away. If 13. Be3, QxN.",

        "17. Rxf2": "Now I should have recovered the piece, but if I do cxB (possible since Rf2 is pinned), but white will take e6, and I will have at most a losing endgame. ",

        "20. Raf1": "I still have Rf1 here,m making the most of my weak position.",
        "20... b5": "?? I just thought to prevent Na5. White's threats are too much to cover them all. All I can do is making his win a little harder. If 28... Rf1, 29. Na5 and I lose more material. ",
        "21. Kh1": "Released the pin, I am at a very short distance from Rf8+ and mate. ",
        "21... Rg8": "Making things harder for white. I can't move the N or Bxe4. Maybe Re8 could have been better. ",
        "22. Rf2f5": "I can admit my mistake, and go Re8, but again, it seems only a meaningless resistance, after the material disadvantage. ",
        "22... Nd4": "? Using my last piece, but what else?",
        "23. Bxe5": "! The B in e5 whorts more than the exchange. Nxc2 was useless, so...",
