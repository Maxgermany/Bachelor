        "1... d5": "The second most popular move, after 1\u2026 e5.",
        "2. Bb2 Bg4": "A very strange move, more popular is 2\u2026 Nf6, but practice favours black after 2\u2026 Bg4, and no so much with 2\u2026 Nf6.",
        "3. f3": "!? The Litus Gambit, strange-looking at first, but very fun to play.",
        "3... Bf5": "More popular nowadays is 3\u2026 Bh5.",
        "4. e4 dxe4 5. Nc3": "Attacking the e4-pawn.",
        "5... Nf6 6. Qe2": "!? This is where the Litus Gambit starts to look even stranger. The queen now blocks in the f1-bishop, and it should be clear to black that the queen wants to go to b5, forking the king and bishop.",
        "6... exf3 7. Qb5+": "The bishop can block, but the b7-pawn is unprotected.",
        "7... Bd7 8. Qxb7 Bc6": "?? A losing blunder, much better was 8\u2026 Nc6! developing a piece and allowing the queen to protect the rook, but now things are going to start looking very ugly for black.",
        "9. Bb5": "! Showing why 8\u2026 Nc6 was better.",
        "9... f2+ 10. Kxf2 Qxd2+": "The threats on the white king are nothing, and the queen on d2 will provide as a target for white.",
        "11. Nge2 Ng4+ 12. Kf1": "The only move which doesn't lose.",
        "12... Ne3+ 13. Kg1 Bxb5 14. Nxb5": "Remember that if it wasn't for the queen on d2, then Qc8 would be mate.",
        "14... f6": "The game is looking quite unpleasant for black don't you think?",
        "15. Ned4 e5 16. Bc3": "Finally, black resigns, the Queen is trapped and will soon be lost, plus there are threats of Qxa8 and Qc8+ and all sorts of stuff. Hope you enjoyed, thank you!"
