    "moves": {
        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4": "White typically develops the DSB here to put pressure on c7 later on with the help of a rook on c1\n",
        "4... Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Rc1 dxc4": "Black has also tried ...c6 here with an easy game.\n",
        "7. e3": "I am sure Genius did not like the look of a impending ...c5 after e4. Although out of the two moves e4 is the one that is the fighting move. By playing e3 Genius settles in for a long grind.\n",
        "7... Be6": "Develops the bishop and defends the pawn. At the same time it invites the overzealous Ng5\n",
        "8. Ng5": "White's most resent try with Ng5 ended in failure between Istratesu vs Lagrav. The only things and why players play it is that this move gains the bishop pair along with a mobile centre. I would have opted for Nd2 which is more in the spirit of the game.\n",
        "8... Bd5 9. e4 h6": "The move that makes this playable for black.\n",
        "10. exd5 hxg5 11. Bxg5 Nxd5 12. Bxc4 Nb6": "Atfer Ng5 white is no further ahead than when he started. However, the same can not said for black. He has managed to increase the scope of his DSB, neutralize white's centre and gain tempo on the LSB. He has also saddled white with a long term weakness of a isolated pawn.\n",
        "13. Bb3 Nc6 14. d5": "The only way to handle an isolated pawn is to push it or lose it.\n",
        "14... Nd4": "The position favors black\n",
        "15. O-O Qd7 16. h4": "White would surely wish that h4 is the magic bullet but it is not. The last time is was play in 2011 ended in a disappointing draw. I would have played the positionally better Re1. Though I doubt it offers white anymore winning chances.\n",
        "16... Rad8": "Stacking up on the d5 pawn and threatening ...c6\n",
        "17. a4 Nxb3 18. Qxb3 Bxc3": "I see the point that black is trying to weaken d5 but at the expense of your strongest piece! Best is ...c6.\n",
        "19. bxc3 Qxd5": "Black finally manages to win the d-pawn but at the cost of the intaitive.\n",
        "20. c4 Qf5": "Alternative variation: 20... Qc5 21. a5 Nc8 22. Qxb7 Nd6 [is also good enough for black]\n",
        "21. a5 Rd3 22. Qb2 Na4 23. Qxb7": "Alternative variation: 23. Qb4 Qd7 24. c5 b5 25. axb6 axb6 26. c6 Qd4 27. Qxe7 Rc8 [is marginally in white's favor]\n",
        "23... f6 24. Bh6 Rfd8": "Black's strong control of the center and d-file ensure at least a draw.\n",
        "25. Rce1 Rd3d7 26. Qxa7 Qh5": "Alternative variation: [Putting the knight back in to play makes more sense.] 26... Nc5 27. Be3 Nd3\n",
        "27. Qe3": "One may be tempted to think that white has good chances here with a passer on the a-file but black is completely fine. His better pawn structure and more active pieces and control of the d-file. Make it impossible for the pawn to promote.\n",
        "27... e5": "control the centre; control the game.\n",
        "28. Qa3 Qxh6 29. Qxa4 Qxh4 30. g3": "Alternative variation: 30. Re3 g5 31. Rh3 Qg4 [at least the rook is out and about]\n",
        "30... Qg4 31. a6 Kf7 32. a7 Ra8": "the pawn is a sitting duck on a7\n",
        "33. Kg2 Rd3 34. Rfh1 Qf3+ 35. Kg1 g5": "Black has managed to improve his position somewhat",
        "36. Qa5": "there is no coordination in the white camp. All of the pieces are off doing their own thing.\n",
        "36... Rd7 37. Qa2 Kg6 38. Qb1+ Rd3 39. Qb4": "wanting to play Qe7\n",
        "39... Rad8 40. Qe7 Rd3d7 41. a8=Q Qxa8 42. Rh6+ Kxh6 43. Qxf6+ Kh5 44. Kh2 Rh8 45. Kh3 Rd4 46. Qf7+ Kh6 47. Qf6+ Kh5 48. Qf7+ Kh6 49. Qf6+ Kh5": "after a few slight inaccuracies by black white did manage to get a small but enduring initiative. This however, was not enough to win. The ending was never in doubt.\n"
