        "1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 Bb4": "Marozzi was one of the great experts of the french defense ,usualy he played 4...Be7 in this positions .",
        "5. e5 h6 6. Bd2 Bxc3 7. bxc3 Ne4 8. Qg4 g6 9. h4": "intresting move , the idea of white is to bring the rook to the game by 10. Rh3. now black must defend well.",
        "9... c5 10. Bd3 Nxd2 11. Kxd2": "now white wishes to sacrifies he's LSB by Bxg6, after Rh3 and start massive attack on the black king .",
        "11... Qa5": "mistake : the best move for black was 11...Nc6!.12.Rh3-cxd4!. and if white plays 13.Bxg6?-Nxe5!. and if 13.cxd4-Bd7.14.Bxg6?-Qa5+!.15.c3-fxg6.16.Qxg6+-Kd8.17.Qf6+Kc7 and the black Rook is protected on h8.",
        "12. Rh3 cxd4 13. Bxg6": "good move , now capturing white's LSB will cause black to lose he's rook after 13.Bxg6!-fxg6.14.Qxg6+-Kd8.15.Qf6+with fork on the king and the rook on h8. and if 14...Kf8.15.Rf3+Ke7.16.Qg7+....",
        "13... Qc7 14. Rf3 Rg8": "maybe 14...Rf8 was better move however , white could play .15.Bxf7+-Rxf7.16.Qg8+with powerful attack.",
        "15. Rxf7": "great move , ofcourse if black playes 15...Qxf7?,white will capture the black queen with check !.16.Bxf7+Kxf7.17.Qf3+...",
        "15... Qxc3+ 16. Ke2 d3+": "not 16...Qxa1?.17.Rg7+Kf8.18.Qf4+or Qf3+and mate on 2 moves.",
        "17. cxd3 Qxe5+ 18. Kf3 Rf8": "now it seems that black was saevd however theworld champion restart the attack .",
        "19. Rf5+ Kd7 20. Rxf8 Qxa1 21. Rf7+ Kd8": "maybe 21...Kc6 could gave the black some more  time but still white pressure have been to strong for example :21...Kc6.22.Qa4+Kb6.23.Qb4+Ka6.24.d4..... ",
        "22. Qb4": "threatin double mate on f8 and e7 . 23.Qf8#or 23.Qe7#.",
        "22... Nd7 23. Qd6 Qh8 24. Ne2 e5 25. Nf4": "briliant move , the idea of knights sacrifies is avoidig capturing the white rook on f7 with check ",
        "25... exf4 26. Bf5 Qe8 27. Bxd7": "that was the idea of 25.Nf4!!, now after 27..Qxf7 there is no check on the white  king and after 27.Bg6+ black loses he's queen , there for black resigns .  beautiful game of the world champion .thank you , and i hope you enjoy the game , Daniel ."
