        "3... Bg4": "I love when an opponent makes this move. It seems to pin the knight from protecting the pawn on e5 after the capture. This is also the start of my favorite game Morphy vs the Count, made while watching the barber of saville opera sometime in the late 18 hundreds I think... Look it up.",
