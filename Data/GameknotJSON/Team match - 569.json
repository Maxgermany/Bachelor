        "5... Bg7 6. d3": "This pawn move strikes me as being a little early and I feel that black gets some initiative from it",
        "6... O-O 7. e4": "This move set the tone for much of the remainder of the game, the centre becomes closed as the game progresses. Note also that white is still not in a position to castle yet.",
        "7... d6": "preparing to develop my lsb",
        "8. Nf3 Bg4 9. Bg5 Nd4": "Pressuring the white knight on f3, however white could choose to return the favour with Nc5, the difference being that I would try to push the white knight away with c6",
        "10. O-O": "Probably the most sensible move for white",
        "10... Nxf3+": "Although tempted to leave the knight where it was I wanted to exchange some pieces and try to open up the position a little",
        "11. Bxf3 Bh3": "Not wanting to exchange straight away as it would bring the white queen into the attack",
        "12. Bg2 Qd7 13. Bxh3 Qxh3": "Now that my queen is where I want it I am looking for Ng4",
        "14. Bxf6": "which white prevents",
        "14... Bxf6 15. Nd5 Bd8 16. Qb3 Rb8": "protecting the pawn so that I can get my dsb active on the queens side",
        "17. a4 c6": "But first lets get rid of the pesky knight",
        "18. Ne3 Qh6 19. Ng4 Qg5 20. Qd1 a6 21. b4 Bb6": "aiming the dsb at the white king, I am hoping it get it into the hole at d4 where it will be very difficult to extract",
        "22. Qf3 Bd4 23. Rab1 c5 24. b5": "It would of course be senseless for white to take the c pawn as it would leave him an isolated pawn on a",
        "24... axb5 25. axb5": "This could be a mistake from white as it opens the a file for me to grab",
        "25... Kg7": "though first I need to prevent an intrusion on f6",
        "26. Kh1": "This is a wise move by white though I am not sure its needed just yet, perhaps better would have been Ra1",
        "26... Rba8": "grabbing the open file, I am looking to double my rooks or to try to grab that weak d pawn",
        "27. Qe2 b6 28. f4": "This doesn't seem a good move to me as it opens a very nice line for my dsb, all I need now is my queen on the h1 a8 diagonal and white could be in trouble",
        "28... Qe7 29. f5 Kg8": "preventing the fork",

        "31... Qb7": "Now my queen is where I want her all I need to do is grab that d3 pawn if I can",
        "32. Qg4": "This seems a mistake to me as it leaves the d pawn undefended, i'm not sure where the queen is going",
        "32... Ra3 33. Rf5": "Taking the rook is fatal due to gxf5 Qg7#",
        "33... Rxd3": "I continue with my plan, all I need to do now is grab the e pawn",
        "34. Qg5": "I really don't understand this move, however I am happy to take a free pawn as white hasn't seen the threat",
        "34... Qxe4+": "And now its game over for white as we will see very soon",
