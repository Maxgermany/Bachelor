        "1. Nf3": "The beginnings of Reti.",
        "1... e5": "I gave him an easy pawn.  A truly dumb mistake on my part.  While it opens up the board, it's not what I wanted to do.",
        "2. Nxe5": "At this point, Dad said, \"Thanks!\"",
        "2... d6": "Down a pawn, my tack is going to be conservative.  Might as well pressure his knight and open up the board.  I could have pressured with the queen, but didn't want to block up the avenues for developing other pieces.  I certainly didn't want to offer a trade by moving Nc6.",
        "3. Nf3": "According to the book ...\n1. Nf3 e5 2. Nxe5 d6 3. Nf3\nA04: Reti opening",
        "3... Bg4": "A bit aggressive all things considered, but it does present some options down the road.",
        "4. c4": "Dad's been playing the c-pawn early a lot lately.  I seem to see this a lot lately, and I've started doing so myself as white.",
        "4... Nd7": "I'm not sure why I'm not developing my king side at this point.  I suppose I'm trying to build support for an eventual pawn move to c5.",
        "5. d4": "Dad has a strong center pawn structure now.",
        "5... Qf6": "This seems like a mistake as it blocks the kingside development even further.",
        "6. Nc3": "Dad strengthens the middle more.",
        "6... Bxf3": "This move was not necessary.  It only speeds up the game.  With a pawn down, this probably wasn't wise.  The only advantage it confers is a stacked pawn structure.",
        "7. exf3": "I'm not sure I would have exposed the King here, but he did.",
        "7... Qe6+": "Simple harassment without meaningful development.",
        "8. Be3": "A simple block that also develops the queenside.",
        "8... Ne7": "I'm looking ahead to the possibility of Nf5 thus pressuring the bishop blocking the queen check.",
        "9. Nb5": "Massive knight fork possibility at Nxc7 .",
        "9... Kd8": "Argh, pesky knights.  Obviously, a6 leads to a fork.  O-O-O loses a pawn.  Rc8 loses a pawn.  I think Kd8 is the only move that I have here. Thoughts?  By moving the king, I've given up the ability to castle either way.",
        "10. Qb3": "With the king out of position, it makes sense to pressure that side of the board.",
        "10... c6": "A simple defensive move.",
        "11. Nxd6": "An interesting sacrifice.  I later commented to Dad that this wasn't necessary, but Dad says he saw a possible forced draw.  With a pawn advantage, I think he's being quite charitable.  In any event, this leads to an even situation.",
        "11... Qxd6": "At this point, my center is destroyed, my king is out of position, and my development is a bit behind that of white.",
        "12. Qxb7": "Back to even.  Wouldn't Nb6 have been better?",
        "12... Qb8": "But, I choose a more aggressive defense and offer the queen trade.",
        "13. Qxb8+": "Dad accepts the queen trade.  At this point, a draw seems likely.",
        "13... Rxb8": "With the queen trade, I gain control of the b file.",
        "14. b3": "I might have preferred Ra-b1, but this works, too.",
        "14... Nf5": "Looking for a knight-bishop trade at this stage in the game.",
        "15. Bd3": "Final developing move for white.  All mid-level pieces are out, and white still has the option to castle.",
        "15... Bb4+": "I check here to at least temporarily delay white's castle.  I expected the following:\n16.\tKe2 \tBc3\n17.\tRa-c1 \tNxd4 \n18.\tKd1 \tBb2\n19.\tRb1 \tBc3",
        "16. Kd1": "This seems to beg for Nxe3  fxe3.",
        "16... Bc3": "I expected this combination:\n17.\tRc1 \tNxe3 \n18.\tfxe3 \tBb4\n... and white followed suit.",
        "17. Rc1": "Go away!",
        "17... Nxe3+": "Check!",
        "18. fxe3": "Whatever!  Go away!",
        "18... Bb4": "OK, I'll go away (for now).",
        "19. Rc2": "With black having a black square bishop, this move is smart as it effectively diminishes the strength of that piece.",
        "19... g6": "Countering the bishop's line to permit Rh8 to move.",
        "20. c5": "This gets scary for black as the bishop may get trapped.",
        "20... Ba5": "But, I think I'm overly worried here.  The bishop is not yet at risk for trap.  In any event, I back off.",
        "21. Ke2": "White is slowly advancing his pieces making the board smaller for black.",
        "21... Re8": "Controlling the open file.",
        "22. Kf2": "Avoiding possible problems with Re8.",
        "22... Kc7": "I'm also trying to shorten the board for white, but I have less pawns to provide cover.",
        "23. Rb1": "Although both of my rooks are controlling the open files, this is still smart as sets up the possibility of advancing the b pawn.",
        "23... Kd8": "I see problems down the road for this side of the board, and I think my logic was to get the King over in support of the f, g and h pawns.",
        "24. a3": "A nice little pawn wall.",
        "24... Bc7": "Time to get out of Dodge and start working on a f, g, h pawn attack.",
        "25. g3": "White further shortens the board.",
        "25... h5": "Space is becoming important on the board, and I want to prevent g4.",
        "26. Be4": "Nice pressure on the unprotected c pawn.",
        "26... Re6": "My only real option.",
        "27. Rd2": "This shift creates the possibility of a d pawn attack and aligns the rook with the black king.",
        "27... f5": "Go away!  Hide!",
        "28. d5": "I probably didn't see this coming.  Nice move by white.  ",
        "28... cxd5": "I expected the following:\n29.\tBxd5 \tRe7\n30.\tc6 \tNf8\n31.\tBc4  \tKe8",
        "29. Bxd5": "Back to even.",
        "29... Re7": "I'm trying to retain control of the e file without giving up too much space.",
        "30. Bc6": "Excellent move.  I probably didn't see this coming either.  The knight is trapped by the rook.  This was all set up in move 27.  I'm not at risk of losing a piece yet, but pressure is definitely mounting.",
        "30... a5": "This move is an attempt to set up a counter-attack, i.e. a4.  At this point, white cannot capture bxa4 without losing a rook.",
        "31. b4": "A safe defending move.",
        "31... axb4": "Accelerating the game.",
        "32. axb4": "Trade accepted.  White's better off for the trade as the pawn is still supported by a rook.",
        "32... Ke8": "Still trying to get the king to support the f, g and h pawns.",
        "33. Ra2": "This sets up potential pressure on the 7th rank but permits the king to escape.",
        "33... Kf7": "I stick with my plan.",
        "34. Bxd7": "Accelerating the game further.  I generally don't mind trading a knight for a bishop late in the game.",
        "34... Rxd7": "Back to even with control of the d file.",
        "35. Ke2": "Recognizing and counteracting the down-the-road Rd2 threat.",
        "35... Be5": "Sets up a possible attack on the b pawn.",
        "36. Rb3": "Prevents the bishop attack.",
        "36... Rdb7": "Stacked rooks are fun.",
        "37. Ra4": "Power against power, the definition of a draw.",
        "37... Rb7b5": "I'm hoping to stop the pawn advancement.  I've also created the possibility of Rxc5 bxc5 Rxb3 trade.",
        "38. f4": "Go away!",
        "38... Bc7": "Sets up the possibility of Ba5 bxa5 Rxb3 or other variations on this theme.",
        "39. c6": "Seems premature to me.",
        "39... Rb8b6": "Now, white must defend and risks losing a pawn.",
        "40. Rc3": "White's only option to keep the advanced pawn.",
        "40... Ke7": "Why didn't I take the b pawn?  We'll never know.  I guess I was eying the c pawn.",
        "41. Ra2": "White relinquishes the b pawn completely.",
        "41... Rb5xb4": "I accept the gift.",
        "42. Rd2": "White blocks the king in support and controls the d file.",
        "42... Rb4b2": "A pawn up, I seek to press for a draw.",
        "43. Rcc2": "Black doesn't force the trade, but still offers it.",
        "43... Rxc2": "I press for the draw.",
        "44. Rxc2": "At this point, black is up by one pawn again.",
        "44... Kd6": "Black looks to go up 2 pawns.",
        "45. Kf3": "There's nothing to be done for the c pawn, so white consolidates his one pawn advantage.",
        "45... Rxc6": "Up 2 and offering a rook trade.",
        "46. Rxc6+": "White accepts the trade.",
        "46... Kxc6": "Black is up 2 but down a pawn.",
        "47. e4": "There's not much to say from here on out.  The game has some win possibilities for white, but I was fairly set on just not losing and avoiding any horrible mistakes.  When white offers a piece ...",
        "47... fxe4+": "I take it.",
        "48. Kxe4": " 2 to black but quickly losing pawns.  Lots of draw options here.",
        "48... Bd8": "Some help for the pawns.",
        "49. Ke5": "If white can separate the king from the pawns, a win is possible.",
        "49... Kd7": "Perhaps a little later than would normally be comfortable, I staring moving my king back over in support.",
        "50. h3": "The king can't move anywhere useful, so a safe move.",
        "50... Ke7": "My only shot is to separate his king from the pawns.",
        "51. f5": "If I take at this point, I could lose as it would definitely separate the h pawn from its support.",
        "51... Kf7": "So, I move the king closer.",
        "52. fxg6+": "Acceleration.",
        "52... Kxg6": "Back to  2, now in support of the h pawn.",
        "53. Kf4": "Supporting move.",
        "53... Bg5+": "h4 might have been more interesting as it would have trapped white's last h pawn.",
        "54. Kf3": "White's only real move.",
        "54... h4": "I needed to do this earlier.",
        "55. gxh4": "Trade.",
        "55... Bxh4": " 2, but I've not separated the king from his last pawn.",
        "56. Kg4": "White's best move, since it keeps the bishop at bay.",
        "56... Bg5": "Bd8 might have been better.  In any event, I offer the draw here and white accepts.  Good game Pop!"
