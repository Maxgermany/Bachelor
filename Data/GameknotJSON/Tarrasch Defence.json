        "11... Bxf6 12. Nb3": "threatening to capture the d pawn",
        "12... d4": "An assertive move but perhaps a bit too aggressive. The pawn looks well supported on this square but it gone too far ahead. The solid 12. Be6 is recommended where black is passive but solid",
        "13. Nd5": "! a great sortie that cuts off one of the defends to the d pawn and threatens to remove another defender. And refutes black's last move in style. ",

        "34... Qxe2 35. Rxf5": "not 35. Kg2 when the queen would be allowed to return to e5",
