        "1... c5": "I play my trusted Sicilian.",
        "2. Nf3": "He plays the main line.",

        "4. Bd3": "Defending e4, although there is no danger as 4.....Nxe4 is met with 5. Qa4+ winning the knight on e4. My opponent said afterwards that he should have played 4. h3",
        "4... Bg4": "Played, before he can get h3 in....",
        "5. h3": "He attacked my bishop.",
        "5... Bh5": "I retreated. Probably exchanging on f3 is better. Now I get into an uncomfortable position.",

        "6... dxe5": "I take.",
        "7. Qa4+": "He throws in a check, so that he can recapture the pawn on e5.",

        "13... O-O": "And I castle at last.",
        "14. Nc4": "His knight reaches a fine blocking square. There is the threat of 15. Ne5 and if 15.....Rb6 16. Bc4 and my a7 pawn goes.",
        "14... Nd7": "So I stop that.",
        "15. Ne3": "Strange move by the knight. It was already placed on its best square on c4.",

        "17. Nf1": "With a threat of 18. Bf4",

        "19... Bg6": "I drop back.",
        "20. f5": "I didn't mind this at first, as I thought he had taken the pressure off my e pawn, but I soon find he has the wonderful e4 square for his knight.",
        "20... Nb6": "I hit his queen.",
        "21. Qg4": "Queen switches to the king-side.",
        "21... Bf7": "Bishop drops back.",
        "22. Ne4": "Knight takes up a commanding position.",
        "22... Qd7": "My queen drops back. 23. Bh6 looks strong now, but I can defend with g7-g6 (but not Bf8?? 24. Nxf6! winning).",
        "23. Be3": "So he attacks c5 instead.",
        "23... Nd5": "I open an attack on b2.",
        "24. b3": "So he prevents that.",
        "24... Nxe3": "The only way to stop going a pawn down.",

        "27. Rg3": "Another attack on g6.",
        "27... g5": "So I try to block off the king-side.",
        "28. Bc4": "He exchanges off my good bishop.",
        "28... Bxc4": "So off it goes.",
        "29. dxc4": "He takes back.",
        "29... Qe8": "and my queen prepares to protect the light squares round my king. He probably has a slight edge here, good knight on e4 v my bad bishop, but I think black should be able to defend. However he now thinks he has a good sacrifice.",
        "30. Nxg5": "He takes.",
        "30... fxg5": "I take back.",

        "34... Kd7": "I run again.",
        "35. Rg7+": "Check again.",
        "35... Kc8": "My king runs again. Now this position is lost for black, just one pawn for a rook. I think the best way to fight on is to take the second pawn and hope for the best. Instead he plays a little trap.",
        "36. Rg8": "What would you play here for black dear reader?",
        "36... Rd1+": "Did you find it? Of course, if I take the rook immediately, 37. Qxc6 is mate.",

        "37... Qxg8": "I take.",
        "38. Qxc6+": "He takes.",
