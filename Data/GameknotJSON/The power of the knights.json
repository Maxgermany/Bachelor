        "3... Nc6": "This was to attack the pawn but I think now that I should have played Nf6 in preference",
        "4. c3 e5 5. Qe2 Qa5": "threatens Nxd4",
        "6. Bd2 Be6 7. Nf3 exd4 8. cxd4 Bb4 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. Ng5": "An early attack from white but I am not sure it accomplishes much, I would be more concerned with getting my king safe. ",
        "10... O-O-O 11. Nxe6 Rde8": "threatening Rxe6 pinning the queen",
        "12. O-O-O Rxe6 13. Qc4 Rd8": "prevents the fork from d5",
        "14. Nb5 Bxd2+ 15. Rxd2": "I don't like this move from white, not that there was a lot better that I can see, it allows Re1+ ",
        "15... Re1+ 16. Kc2": "I was expecting Rd1",
        "16... Nb4+ 17. Kb3": "This is probably the best of the options as Kc3 loses to Nd5+,  Qxd5 (forced due to threat of Kb3 Qxa2#)  Nxd5 and white is lost",
        "17... Qxa2+ 18. Kxb4": "Again probably the better option due to Kc3, Ne4+, Kb3, Nxd2+ forking the queen",
        "18... Nd5+ 19. Kc5 b6+ 20. Kc6": "forced",
        "20... Qxc4+ 21. Bxc4 Nb4#": "Thanks for reading please comment"
