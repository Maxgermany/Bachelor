But i think we need to open the middle a little bit.  bluenoser: g6\ng6 with thoughts of Bg7 developing and getting ready for our king side castle, if they play d4 we could play d3 instead of Bg7. I think d5 could really open things up also, with lots of possibilities. I just like to play a bit more defence.  a_random_guy: 3...d5\nAfter all, we played 2...c6 to prepare 3...d5.  ptitroque: 3.d5\nis good.

Our LSB could also be nicely placed in e6 - we can see later were to settle it.  roneshet: Bf5\nI say we should take out our bishop, so we can open the way to take out the knight afterwards to d7. then we can move safely e5.",

It likely transposes into the same lines.  roneshet:  Nbd7\nI thinks we need to protect e5 - the middle.\nThan we can move to e5 next move.\nThe way i see it, d5 is already overprotected...  ptitroque: 5. e6\nFreeing our DSB, so that we'll be able to castle whithin 2 moves and have control over the a3 f8 diagonal.\nNbd7 ik ok as well.

We'll have to wait for White's reply to figure out what is the optimal square for our black squared bishop.  roneshet: Nbd7\nI agree. I think we should also prepare for right side castling. we need the h8 rock there.  ptitroque: 6... Nbd7\nFor the sames reasons than a random guy.\nWe have to get control on c5 and e5.\nWe have no other proper place for the knight.

That d4 push would partially block their dark-squared bishop though, so there's that. Also, I don't really see the bishop being usefull on the a7-g1 diagonal for the moment, since they can easily close that diagonal. 7.Bd6 could help prepare an e5 pawn push by black, eventually after castling.  bluenoser: Bd6\nOf the two moves suggested I like Bd6. Bc5 in my opinion just helps them push d4 and chase our bishop around. I guess so far we are in agreement to move that Bishop. I do believe Bd6 to be more solid for us.",

I was also looking at Qc7, then e5...but that might be too slow as they may push d4.  ptitroque: Qc7?\nseems ok but if they play a further Rc1, we might be in trouble.  roneshet: Qe7 - Why trouble?\nCan you explain a little bit, why are we going to be in trouble if the do Rc1?\nI think e5 is a very good move.\nI thought of h6 also. opening up for the king.  ptitroque: @roneshet\nIf\n1. ...

Qe7 seems safe for me, but we'll be heading to a close game and be less active.

Bh5\nI've had a closer look and it seems it works.  bluenoser: Try Again here\nWhat makes Bh5 better than better than Bf5? I am not disagreeing just wondering why we want to stay on that diagonal.  ptitroque: @bluenoser\na random guy probably has a better analyse than I do.\nThe only little advantage I can find in Bh5 is that it is on the diagonal of their queen. Obviously they will notice it but it may limitate their moving possibilities at some points.  a_random_guy: @ptiroque\nThe problem I see with 10...Bf5 is that they can basically play 11.Nh4 to trade off our bishop for their knight. If they want to push g5 to push our bishop to g3 before forcing a trade with 12.Nh4, they'd have weakened their kingside more in that variation then if we had played 10...Bf5.  ptitroque: @a random guy\nThanks, I didn't thought about Nh4  bluenoser: thanks for explaining\nI can see it now! \n ",

Also gives us space advantage and their two bishops don't look very troublesome right now or in the near future.  roneshet: dxe4 explain\nplease explain a little more about the reasoning. why would it prevent their knight from coming to g5? h6 would do it?",

It could possibly go to c5  a_random_guy: 19...Qf8\nSure, 19...Qf8 looks ugly, but it does unpin our e pawn and it provides additionnal support to our c8 rook, if they decide to pile on the c file.",

As this is how I thought during, I hate to say it, but the kibitzing moment in GM Judit Polgar's puzzle with the terrible headache.
