        "1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 dxc4 4. a4 Bf5": "This looks like a normal Slav defense except that black hasn't played Nf6 yet.\n",
        "5. e3 Bxb1": "This capture doesn't help black at all.\n",
        "6. Rxb1 b5": "Repeatedly I have seen that when black tries to hang onto the c4 pawn, it backfires badly for him.\n",
        "7. b3": "This is the wrong move order, for the subtle reason that if White plays first axb5 cxb5, b3 and now Qa5+ is met with Nd2 and now c3 allows Qf3 with the attack on the rook on a8.  This is not possible if white doesn't play axb5 first!\n",
        "7... cxb3": "This is the wrong choice as it gives White a huge advantage.  Instead Qa5+, Qd2 (or b4 Qd8) c3, Qc2 is nearly equal for Black.\n",
        "8. axb5 cxb5 9. Bxb5+ Nd7 10. Qxb3 Ngf6": "Where is the weakness in black's position?\n",
        "11. Ne5 e6 12. O-O Be7": "Bd6 would have been a much better choice.\n",
        "13. Nc6 Qc8": "It would have been better to play Qc7 because of the tactical trick after Nxe7 Ng4 threatening mate, f4 Kxe7 and now the black king has an escape square.\n",
        "14. Ba3": "Not as good as Nxe7 Kxe7, Ba3+ Ke8, Rfc1 according to my computer.\n",
        "14... Bxa3": "Black could have played Nd5 and is king would have a better chance at castling or escaping to f6 if white makes both captures on e7.\n",
        "15. Qxa3": "Here black blunders, but it would be useful to look what would happen after Ng8 (Nd5, e4), Ne5! Ngf6, Rfc1 and the queen has nowhere to hide, if Qd8 then  Nc6 and black loses his queen or gets mated.\n",
