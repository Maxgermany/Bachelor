        "2. e5": "this move was surprising cause i didn't really know hot to react to this. it does stop my king side Knight development.",
        "2... f6 3. exf6 Nxf6": "well it works like this also, but i weakened my king side a bit.",
        "4. d3 d5 5. Bf4 Nc6 6. Nc3 e5": "here i have a nice central grip and also managed to kick the bishop w tempo.",
        "7. Bg5 Qb6 8. Bxf6 gxf6": "now my king side is really weak, but in exchange i got his dsb, but I'm starting think about castling queen side.",

        "17. f4 exf3 e.p. 18. Nxf3 Bxc3+": "another pawn won. no problem, ill take it.",
        "19. Nxc3 Qxc3+ 20. Kf2 Rc8": "decided to add support to c4, because its a passed pawn, and might be useful later on.",
        "21. Be2 O-O": "Now i just want to connect my rooks and there's really no major threat if kings on g2.",

        "26. Rg2 Qxh4+": "free pawn again, and with check now.",
