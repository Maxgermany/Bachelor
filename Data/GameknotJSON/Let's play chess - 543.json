        "2... cxd4 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Bd7": "Bd7? I am beginning to like my position",
        "6. Bc4 g6 7. Bg5": "Lets put some pressure on that king side. ",
        "7... Bg7": "Black opts for the sniper game, but lacks any coordinated attack. I feel no threat at this point in the game, and opt to castle while considering my plan of attack",
        "8. O-O O-O 9. a4": "I was a little out of good moves here. Maybe start an attack on the queen side can open things up?",
        "9... Nc6 10. Nxc6": "Black tries to reconquer the middle, i won't allow it, and removes his Knight that could support his bishop at g7. ",
        "10... Bxc6 11. f3 a6 12. b4": "As soon as I made this move, i thought that Black might go for the Rook at a1. Looking at how my pieces all where lined up for the king side assault, i thought this is the time to strike, let this be a trap. With the queen at a1 and a bishop at h6 it would be a short game.",
        "12... Nxe4": "The plot thickens..",
        "13. Nxe4 Bxa1": "From this point on, it is a loosing battle for black..",
        "14. Qxa1": "Notice how the queen has access to the king, just need the bishop on h6",
        "14... Bxe4": "Great move (for me). Now the pressure can be increased by moving the f-pawn out of the way",
        "15. fxe4": "Notice all the attack lines toward the king side, just need to move that bishop to h6",
        "15... Qb6+": "That was the only move left for black",
        "16. Kh1 e5": "Without this move, he would have been mate really fast. Block the queens path to the king.",
        "17. Bh6": "Now the focus of the attack is moved to the black f-pawn",
        "17... Rfe8 18. Rxf7": "From here it is a mate by moving Rf8",
        "18... d5 19. Bxd5": "Keep the pressure from the bishop",
        "19... Re6 20. Qf1": "This move brings the queen back in play with an additional mate opportunity",
        "20... Qd6 21. Bxe6": "Black resigns. The next moves would be 21: .. Qxe6 22: Rh8+ Rxh8 23: Qxh8++"
