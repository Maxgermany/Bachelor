        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Be2": "This \"passive\" approach by White actually is quite effective, and transposes to comparably good variations of a QGD after counterattacking the Queen.",
        "4... c6 5. d4 e6 6. O-O Nf6 7. c4": "Both Black and White have been working towards a favorable transposition. Here Black has gotten his bad bishop out but White is now pushing back. ",
        "7... Qd8 8. Nc3 Bb4": "Probably not as effective now that there is no pin.",
        "9. Bg5 Nbd7 10. Qb3 Bxc3 11. bxc3 h6": "Better is ...Qc7, defending b7. ",
        "12. Bh4": "Bh4!? White would have done well to take the Knight (BxN) and win the b pawn. White was trying to hold on to the bishop and provoke king weaknesses instead.",
        "12... b6": "The dark square bishop is already missed. Black would like to play ...Qc7 but would face Bg3.",
        "13. h3 Bh5": "Better was ...Bf5. ",
        "14. g4 Bg6 15. Ne5": "White was playing for this position.",
        "15... c5": "Black saves the pawn but the kingside is now weakened.",
        "16. Nxg6 fxg6 17. Bd3 g5 18. Bg6+ Ke7 19. Bg3 Nf8 20. Bc2 Nf8d7 21. Rad1": "White wants to control the d-file.",
        "21... Re8": "...Re1? accomplishes little because the rook can be driven off by the bishop, and the d-file pin is now a concern. Better was probably Qc8, defending c5 and e6. ",
        "22. Bg6 Rh8 23. dxc5 Qc8 24. Bd6+ Kd8 25. cxb6 Qb7 26. bxa7 Qxa7": "Black is behind a couple pawns but of more concern is the king position. ",
        "27. Rd2 Kc8 28. c5": "White's plan is to advance the pawn to tie down Black's pieces first.",
        "28... Nd5 29. c6 Nc5 30. Qc4 Na4": "Black is in trouble but appears to have lots of fight yet. But the king position is already fatal, which White immediately demonstrates..",
        "31. Rxd5": "31 Rxd5!! shatters Black's position. Qe4! would also win but more slowly after ...Nc7. ",
        "31... exd5": "If... Nb6, Qe4! NxR, Qe6  leads to a similar end to the game.",
        "32. Bf5+": "No need to worry about the Queen, Black is now caught in a mating net.",
        "32... Kd8 33. c7+": "A key move...blocking Black's Queen from defending against checks, and checkmate can't be avoided after ...Ke8 (forced) Qc6 !",
        "33... Ke8 34. Qc6+ Kf7 35. Qd7+": "Qxd5  mates also.",
        "35... Kg8": "Otherwise, if ...Kf6, 36 Qe6 is also checkmate.",
