        "4... g6": "although part of modern theory, this fianchetto is not very common, in this opening: usually follows dxe5, dxe5, Bg4...",
        "5. Ng5": "theory dictates c4, Nb6, Nc3, dxe5, dxe5, soon followed by trading Queens; White decides to hold on to c4 for a while longer and poses an early threat: Nxf7, Kxf7, Qf3+, followed by Qxd5; after Bg7, Qf3, Be6 (forced), White can consider Nxe6...",
        "5... dxe5 6. dxe5 Bg7 7. c4": "worth considering is Bc4, c6, e6, Bxe6, Nxe6, fxe6, 0-0, before trading Queens...",
        "7... Nb4 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. Na3": "forced...",
        "9... Ke8": "dito...",
        "10. f4 a6 11. Bd2 Nb8c6 12. Bc3 Bf5": "trying to force a way towards c2; more promising for Black was f6, exf6, exf6, in a somewhat better position...",
        "13. Be2 Rd8 14. g4 Bd3": "missing the gravity of the situation, Black gets careless: best was Bc8, h3, f6, or at least h6, Nxf7, Kxf7, gxf5, gxf5...",
        "15. e6": "this is what Black missed: not only is White threatening Nxf7, but also Bxg7 or exf7+...",
        "15... Nd4": "or f6, Nf7, Rd4, Bxd4, Nxd4, Bxd3, Nxd3+, Kd2, Nxf4, Nxh8, Bxh8, Nc2...",
        "16. Bd1": "simple, yet effective...",
        "16... fxe6": "Black decides to eliminate all threats at the cost of a piece; better was a5, Nxf7, Rf8, or f6, Nf7, Nbc6...",
        "17. Bxb4 Rf8": "again, not the best decision: best is h6, Nf3, Nc6...",
        "18. Ba4+": "ending all Blacks' illusions...",
        "18... b5": "forced: after c6, Rd1, h6, Rxd3, hxg5, fxg5, Nf3+, Ke2, Rxd3, Kxd3, Black is losing...",
        "19. cxb5 axb5 20. Bd1 Rxf4 21. Bd2 Rf8": "Black is just holding everything together: but now, White is unleashed...",
        "22. Rc1": "Bd3 is trapped, so White is preparing Rc3...",
        "22... h6": "this move is long overdue, and cannot help Black anymore...",
        "23. Rc3 Nc2+": "the only one left...",
        "24. Rxc2": "much stronger than Bxc2, Bxc3, bxc3, hxg5, Bxd3, Rxd3, Nxb5, Kd7!",

        "28... Kg7 29. Rf1 Rfh8 30. Rf2 Be5": "useless and wrong: White will be more than happy to give up h2, granting free passage for the a-pawn; better Rh4, Rg2, Rh3...",
        "31. Nb4": "of course, threatening to trade the all important Bishop after Nc6; so Black has to react and is forced into trading...",
        "31... Rxh2 32. Rxh2 Bxh2 33. a5": "Blacks' DSB is cornered out, by his own c-pawn: this gives Whites' a-pawn free passage...",
        "33... Rb8": "practically the only move, to counter Nc6; after c5, Nc6, Ra8/c8, Bxg5, wraps it all up...",
        "34. Bc4": "Whites' Bishop pair rules supremely: after Bf4, Bc3+, Kf7, a6, Ke8, Bxe6, Black has no play left; so he resigned..."
