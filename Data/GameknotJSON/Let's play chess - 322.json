        "1. e4 c5": "I've never been impressed with the Sicilian Defense.  I realize it's the most popular response to 1. e4, but White doesn't have to head into the myriad of Black's homespun preparation and still get a fantastic game.",
        "2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. d4 cxd4 5. Bc4 Qc7": "This move of the late Yugoslav IM Rabar is considered Black's strongest.  White gets, at worst, a promising gambit for the price of a pawn and if Black goes astray, he can get crushed.",
        "6. Qe2 e6": "6...Nb6 makes a lot more sense to me.",
        "7. Bxd5 exd5 8. Nf3 b6 9. Nxd4": "The game is still about even right now in my opinion.",
        "9... Ba6": "This is what I expected.  The Bishop on b7 would turn out to be a dud.  However, I don't think Black had any idea what my next move was going to be.",
        "10. Nb5": "Black should take the Knight here.  But one never knows...",
        "10... Bxb5 11. Qxb5 Qxe5+ 12. Kd1 Be7 13. Re1 Qh5+ 14. Re2": "In my humble opinion, the game is dead even.  Black's extra pawn is very weak and will fall at some point in the game so I'm not even counting it as a material advantage.",
        "14... Nc6 15. Nd2 O-O 16. f3 Qxh2 17. Qxd5 Rac8 18. Nc4 Qg1+ 19. Kc2 b5": ""
