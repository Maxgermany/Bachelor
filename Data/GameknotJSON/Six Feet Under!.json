        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nI have been playing in Gothicgirl's mamouth mini-tournament.  In this match I come up against a former International Master.  A few ill-judged exchanges had disastrous consequences for me and I ended up resigning the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Any attempt to have avoided this loss would have resulted in Henry being buried six feet under.  Here comes a standard Sicilian Defence from the WIM.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6": "4. ....... Nf6 - development.",
        "5. Nc3 a6": "5. ....... a6 - this move is the Sicilian Naijdorf.",
        "6. Be3 e5 7. Nf3 Be7": "7.......... Be7 - development.",
        "8. Bc4 O-O 9. O-O": "9. 0-0 - both sides castle kingside.",
        "9... Nc6 10. Re1 b5 11. Bf1": "11. Bf1 - would Bb3 have been an improvement.",
        "11... Be6 12. Bg5 Ng4 13. Bxe7 Nxe7 14. Nd5": "14. Nd5? - here is where I start to go wrong.  In retrospect I should have kicked that horsie out of g4 with h3.  I think this is where that move h3 is appropriate.",
        "14... Bxd5 15. exd5 Qb6": "15. ...... Qb6 - an excellent move, nasty double attack on the f pawn.",
        "16. Re2 Rac8": "16. ...... Rac8 - preparing to play Rc5 - attacking the weak d5 pawn.",
        "17. Rc1": "17. Rc1 - preparing c4.",
        "17... Rc5 18. Rd2": "18. Rd2?? - this moves drops the d pawn.  In retrospect I had to try c4 here.",
        "18... Rxd5 19. Rxd5": "19. Rxd5?? - I now dig myself deeper into the mire.  It is only after I took on d5 and pressed the submit button that I saw the deadly Nf2 threatening a discovery.  Here are two variations that lose - anything else and Glenda drops.\r\n\r\nVariation A 19. Rxd5 Nxf2 20. Qe2 Nd3+ 21. Kh1 Nxc1 22. Qd1 Nxd5 23. Qxc1. Variation B 19. Rxd5 Nxf2 20. Rxd6 Nh3+ 21. Kh1 Qg1+ 22. Nxg1 Nf2#.  Yup this is where Henry is buried Six Feet Under, a brilliant Smothered Mate.\r\n\r\nAfter this analysis, due to my opponent's OPTIMUM RATING I knew that she would not miss that so I waved the white flag.\r\n\r\nI hope I can put up a better show against her as black."
