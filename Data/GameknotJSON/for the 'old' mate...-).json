        "14. c3 Nh5": "he opened a path for the bishop and had potential at Kf4.  \r\n\r\ng3 to block knight?  leaves h3 out to dry...  \r\n\r\nBack off knight and attack knight with Queen?\r\n\r\nb4 to block his pawn movement?",
        "15. g3 Qb6": "Nice move, he's pinned f2 and fored me to advance the king, wasting a move.  \r\n\r\nCould move queen up, but if he trades, Kxg3.\r\n\r\nHe is still unable to devolop anything else quickly.\r\n\r\nKg2 makes the pawn at e4 very important, but Kh2 take away a protector from f2....  I can guard e4 pretty well.",
