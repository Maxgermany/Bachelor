        "4... b6": "I say I want it open.",
        "5. e3": "He means to keep his pawn struct, but he is forfeiting c-pawn!",
        "5... bxc5": "I take it.",
        "6. dxc5": "He recaptures.",
        "6... Bxc5": "And it's safe for me to take it, coz there is not much he can do against me with Qa4+ and Bb5. So here the balance starts favouring me.",
        "7. Ne2": "He needs to develop fast for castling.",
        "7... O-O": "I castle myself to avoid any trouble.",
        "8. Bg2": "Fiancetto, he's next to castle.",
        "8... Ba6": "I know his knight will be pinned if he castles.",
        "9. b3": "Not sure of this move here, maybe he wants to get his bishop to the diagonal to get my castle pawns in trouble.",
        "9... c6": "Make way in the diagonal for my queen while also reinforcing d pawn.",

        "13. bxc5": "He takes it.",
        "13... Bxc5": "So do I.",
        "14. Bb2": "Comes to the diagonal, my d pawn is pinned toward my rock.",
        "14... Be7": "I make sure that moving my queen won't let my castle being disturbed, while adding a menace on his rock if he takes my knight.",
        "15. Re1": "Intends to unpin his knight.",
        "15... Bxe2": "But, I won't have it... So I exchange.",
        "16. Qxe2": "Recaps with Queen.",
        "16... Qb8": "I intend to add pressure on the b file, this of course keeps my d-pawn pinned against my a-rock, but I saw no near threats on the pawn. So, taking good squares control is a priority for me.",
        "17. Nc3": "He intends to protect the b file with rocks and place a discovered attack.",

        "19... Rd8": "Rocks belong behind passed pawns.",
        "20. Bc1": "Guess he doesn't like my e5 knight, coz it's keeping his bishop from discovering against my rock. So maybe he wants to push it from f4.",
        "20... d3": "unfortunately, he has no time for that. I push the passed pawn to a double protected square, while it challenges his queen.",
        "21. Qd2": "Not the best place he could put his queen. I would have sent her all the way to the a-file to avoid my knight's next move.",
        "21... Nc4": "I challenge the queen while I prepare a pawn's fork in d2, a double protected square again.",
        "22. Qc3": "Queen has to abandon d2. At this instance, I guess she was trying hopefully to recap my knight after my fork.",
        "22... d2": "Fork!\r\n\r\nSince pawn is attacking a rock, he needs to play Bishop capture if he doesn't want to come out too bad.",
        "23. Bxd2": "Sacrifices his bishop...",
        "23... Nxd2": "I recapture with my en-prise knight to keep the advantage.",
        "24. Ra2": "Wants to get back the material balance by adding pressure on the Knight.",
        "24... Nfxe4": "I saw a nice combination. By capturing e pawn with my f6 knight, his queen is challenged and my other knight defended. Whichever he does, it turns out the better to me. He can't capture d2 knight coz his queen is en-prise. And if he captures e4 knight with rock, I recapture with knight leaving his queen en prise again, forcing him to take it with bishop, and then I'd be capturing his unguarded knight with a check. If he takes it with bishop, the same outcome results if he recaptures with rock, I lifted up the bishop threat on my a-rock and exploited the position with this move.",
        "25. Bxe4": "He tries to keep the best balance. So takes with bishop.",
        "25... Nxe4": "I recapture, he can't take the \"free knight\" without regreting so.",
        "26. Qe3": "Gets his queen off the en-prise position and adds some pressure on my knight.",
        "26... Nf6": "I just fall back my knight to a safe position. In this point, I'm 4 points ahead in material, so, I'll start trading off anything I can.",
        "27. Nb2": "I guess he wants to try coordinating his remaining pieces the best he can.",
        "27... Qb6": "Challenge for queens' exchange.",
        "28. Qf3": "Of course, he'll refuse.",
        "28... Nd5": "I decide it's time for my Bishop to start doing anything.",
        "29. Nc4": "He tries to push his knight with useful purpose.",
        "29... Qa6": "I come off his range.",
        "30. Ne5": "Mate threat... seriously?",
        "30... Bf6": "Mate threat neutralized.",
        "31. Ng4": "Trying to distroy my castle, I think?",

        "33. Nxf6+": "A check!",
        "33... gxf6": " I can't recapture with knight or will lose my queen, so long for my castle... but less pieces on board, so I'm happier.",
        "34. Qg4+": "Yet another check.",
        "34... Kh8": "It's safe for me to remain in the open castle.",
        "35. Rad2": "Adding pressure to pin my knight.",
        "35... Qe5": "I decide I can force queens' exchange now.",

        "38... Rdc8": "I'll seize the open files.",
        "39. Kg2": "Takes his king to a safer place.",

        "43. Rd2": "He decides later.",
        "43... Rcc4": "We add pressure.",
        "44. Rda2": "Last stand.",
