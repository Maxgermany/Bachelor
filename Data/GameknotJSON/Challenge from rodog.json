        "1. d4": "Against this strong player, I'm going to try to equalize in the opening and see what his plans are.",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. Bg5 d5 4. e3 c5 5. c3": "It seems to be a Torre at this pont. I know the opening from White's perspective and should be able to defend.",
        "5... Qb6 6. Qc2 Nc6 7. Nbd2 Bd7 8. Bd3 Rc8 9. Qb1 cxd4 10. exd4 Bd6 11. O-O h6 12. Bxf6": "Now here I was tempting him to exchange on f6 and he finally did. ",
        "12... gxf6 13. Re1 Kf8": "I have no problem with this set-up. The g file is open and the extra f pawn is useful in pressuring the center and keeping knights at bay. The downside is a loose king position and an isolated h pawn.",
        "14. Nf1 Kg7 15. g3": "Here, I think, he startes to go wrong. His f pawn is blocked and and the f1 knight should have gone to g3.",
        "15... Ne7 16. Qc2 Bb5": "Bb5!  Now I can exchange off his powerful bishop and his attack is slowed considerably.",
        "17. Bxb5 Qxb5 18. a3 Qc6": "The king on g7 seems to be a lot safer, my rooks are connected and I have the c file.",
        "19. Ne3 b5 20. Qe2 a5 21. Red1 Ng6 22. a4 bxa4 23. c4 Ne7 24. c5": "Releasing some tension with c5. Since he gave up a pawn to open the b file, I should think he would consider doing something there or just taking the d pawn.",
        "24... Bc7 25. Rd2 Rcb8 26. Nd1 Rb4": "His plan, whatever that is, is too slow. I have a real advantage here.",
        "27. Nc3": "With this move, he offered a draw and I accepted. After taking back the pawn, there might have followed an exchange of rooks with his knight going to c6, but then ...Nc8 pretty much ends his counterlpay."
