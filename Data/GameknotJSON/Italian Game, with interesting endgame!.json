    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "This game is a well fought game with some interesting ideas on initiative and tempo. The endgame is also quite interesting.",
        "1... e5": "Black responds symmetrically ",
        "2. Nf3": "Once I read that this 2.Nf3 is called the 'Russian game'\nIn any case, it is a good move as Black is almost obliged to defend the pawn (unless he plays 2...Nf6, the Petroff defence)",
        "2... Nc6": "Black defends the pawn, and develops a piece",
        "3. Bc4": "White plays the Italian Game, this has a general tendency to turn into a 'open' type of game, with either one or both sets of central pawns exchanged.",
        "3... Nf6": "The immediate development of the knight is called the 'Two Knights Game'.\nIt is VERY sharp and theoretical and so is not to everyones taste, it certainly does not appeal to me playing this move as Black unless you are very well prepared.\nIf you are well prepared, it is EXCELLENT!",
        "4. d4": "White immediately makes a move on the centre with a threat, and opens a line for the c1 bishop and provides some space for the Queen. \nWhite threatens 5. dxe5",
        "4... exd4": "Black captures the pawn, removing the threat.",
        "5. Ng5": "White sacrifices a pawn and makes a large threat of Nxf7",
        "5... d5": "Black threatens the Bishop on c4 and the pawn on e4.\nThis move is practically forced, and is a very familiar theme in the 'Two knights defense'.\n",
        "6. exd5": "White captures the pawn and threatens the knight on c6.\n6. Bxd5 Nxd5\n7. exd5 Qxd5  and Black is already better, as he has the two bishops, a extra pawn, developed his queen and has exchanged an attacking piece.",
        "6... Qe7+": "Black checks with the queen. This is a very interesting idea for Black. White reply of kf1 is forced.\nBoth sides will have development problem and king safety issues. \nWhite will have to somehow develop the h1 rook.\nBlack on the other hand will have to deal with the fact his queen blocks the dark squared bishop, as well as the fact his knight on c6 is en prise to the pawn at the moment.",
        "7. Kf1 Ne5": "Black defends the knight, and also threatens the c4 bishop. The knight also defends the important f7 square.",
        "8. d6": "White decides to try and increase pressure by sacrificing a pawn.",
        "8... Qxd6": "Black captures the pawn.\n8...cxd6 would have seriously messed up Blacks pawn structure.",
        "9. Qe2": "White attacks the knight.\nThis is quite a tricky move by White. It pins the knight, and so stop Nxc4. It also threatens Bf4 with a simple double attack on the pinned knight. It also threatens Nf3 in some cases, so Black must play quite carefully!",
        "9... Qe7": "Black defends the knight.\nThis is a very good move. Black recognises the danger and retreats his queen back.\nIt is not such a great loss of time as one would expect, as he threatens to exchange on c4.",
        "10. Bf4": "White decides to develop a piece, and try and gain a time and initiative advantage.\nAlso possible was Bb3, this saves the two bishops but gives up a tempo.",
        "10... Nxc4": "Black captures the bishop.",
        "11. Qxc4": "White recapures the knigt. Forced",
        "11... Be6": "Blacks game is not particularly easy to play.\nI like the idea of playing to exchange the queens and then giving back the pawn on c7 to gain time.\nWhite has a long term problem with his h1 rook to develop, and if Black adopts this plan it looks promising.\ne.g.\n11...Qc5! \n12. Qxc5? (Nd2! is  probably better) 12...Bxc5\n",
        "12. Nxe6": "White exchanges knight for Bishop and elimites the disadvantage of the two bishops.",
        "12... fxe6": "Black decides to take with the pawn. If he can keep the two centre pawns, Black will have a very superior centre position.\nI think overall Black has the better game here.",
        "13. Nd2": "White develops his last minor piece.\nQxd4 is far too dangerous, as the Black rook will come to the d line very strongly with a gain of time on the White queen. This move should be avoided immdiately.\nWhite threatens Re1 with a strong attack against the e6 pawn.",
        "13... O-O-O": "Castles Queenside and improves the Black king safety, as well as defending the d4 pawn.",
        "14. Re1": "White develops with a threat against the e6 pawn.",
        "14... Nd5": "Black stops the threat on the e6 pawn,\nbut this move looks very unnatural and leaves the e5 square very weak.\nA better plan is to try to exchange Queens, give up the e6 pawn, and develop quickly.\nThe white rook on h1 will takes at least 3 moves to develop, and Black will gain the initiative.",
        "15. Be5": "White immediately places the threatened bishop on the weak e5 square.",
        "15... Qb4": "Black finds a good plan to exchange the queens and develop his f8 bishop.",
        "16. Qxd4": "White regains the pawn.",
        "16... Bc5": "Black develops and also gains time with a threat against the White queen",
        "17. Qxb4": "White exchanges queens, as there are no other good squares to go to.",
        "17... Nxb4": "Black recaptures, with a double threat against the c2 and a2 pawn.",
        "18. Ne4": "White moves the knight to a strong central square and attacks the bishop.",
        "18... Bb6": "Black defends the bishop, placing is on a strong square. Be7 is also good.",
        "19. Bxg7": "White takes a pawn and makes a threat against the Black rook.",
        "19... Rhg8": "Black moves the attacked rook and attacks the White bishop.",
        "20. Bc3": "White defends the bishop.",
        "20... Nxc2": "Black carries out his threat of taking a pawn, and also attacks the White rook.",
        "21. Rc1": "White moves the rook and counter-attacks the Black knight.",
        "21... Nd4": "Black moves the knight to safety.\nIt is time to evaluate the position!\nMaterial - equal.\nKing safety - Blacks king is safe. Whites king is less safe, but not critically.\nActivity - All Blacks pieces are active. White has a problem piece of the rook on h1.\nOther features - Black has a isolated pawn on e6, but this is not important at present as it is difficult to take advantage of and helps Blacks centre control.\nConclusion: BLACK IS BETTER\n",
        "22. Bxd4": "White exchanges the powerful Black knight of d4.\nThis is a good move, as White will play with a strong knight against strong bishop.",
        "22... Rxd4": "Black recaptures with a threat against the e4 knight.",
        "23. f3": "White defends the e4 pawn.\nThe knight has a outpost which cannot be removed as it is on light squares.\n\nEvaluation: Approximately even game now.",
        "23... Rgd8": "Black doubles his rooks on the open file.",
        "24. Ke2": "White stops the threat of Rd1+",
        "24... e5": "This move does not much, but it is hard to think of a good plan for Black.\nRd3 threatens Re3+ but this can be stoped by White playing Rc3!.\nPerhaps Black should push the h pawn or try and attack the g2 pawn.",
        "25. Rhd1": "White seeks to exchange the powerful doubled Black rooks.",
        "25... Rg8": "Black moves the rook to the open g line and attack the White pawn.",
        "26. g3": "White defends the pawn moving it forward one square.\nPerhaps moving two squares is better, but often in endings it is a good idea if you are not sure to move the pawn just one square. The reason for this is that you can always move the pawn again (sometimes!). Whereas if you move two squares, you can't move it backwards later!",
        "26... Rg6": "Black improves his rook to a useful rank e.g. it could go to the h line to attack the pawn.",
        "27. Rxd4": "White exchanges a set of rooks.\nWith each exchange Whites game improves, as the isolated e5 pawn is becoming a serious weakness and the White kingside pawn numerical advantage is increasingly important and the Black king is far away on the Queenside.",
        "27... Bxd4": "Black recaptures with the bishop and threatens the b2 pawn.",
        "28. b3": "White defends the pawn. \nThis is better than defending with the rook, as in endings it is important to try to keep your rook active and not passive.",
        "28... b6": "Black begins to advance his Queenside pawns.\nAnother plan centralising the king by Kd7.",
        "29. h4": "White pushes his kingside pawn advantage.\nEVALUATE the position:\nMaterial - even\nKing safety - even, not a important factor.\nActivity - the e4 knight is very well placed, and is slightly superior to the black bishop, which has few square to move to as the e5 and b6 pawns block its path somewhat. The black rook is quite active. The White rook is reasonably placed. Whites king is a slightly more active than Blacks.\nConclusion - slight advantage to White.\nPLAN - Try and advance the kingside pawns.",
        "29... h5": "Black prevents g4.",
        "30. Rc2": "White improves the position of his rook, to a better 2nd rank allowing it to come to g2 or h2 (once the king moves out of the way)",
        "30... Kb7": "Black advances the king, but to the wrong side of the board. The action is on the kingside, so this is where the king should head towards.",
        "31. Kd3": "White improves the king position slighly, and allows the rook access to the kingside.",
        "31... c5": "Black advances the Queenside pawns.",
        "32. Rg2": "White improves the rook position, and has a positional threat of  pawn to g4.",
        "32... Kc6": "Black improves his king position.",
        "33. g4": "White advances g4, and threatens to play g5 creating a powerful passed pawn.",
        "33... Rg7": "Black moves the rook to the seventh rank, possibly with some ideas of playing it to a7 in some cases if the Queenside pawns advance.\n",
        "34. Nf6": "White makes a threat against the h pawn.",
        "34... hxg4": "Black exchanges the pawn.\n",
        "35. fxg4": "White recaptures the pawn.\nWhite has a large advantage with the connected passed pawns.",
        "35... Rf7": "Black attacks the White knight, and threatens Rf3+ if the knight moves.",
        "36. g5": "White defends the knight, and pushes the passed pawn.",
        "36... e4+": "Excellent move. Black looks for dynamic counterplay and does not defend passively.",
        "37. Kxe4": "White takes the pawn.",
        "37... Bxf6": "Black captures the powerful White knight, wins back the pawn and enters a rook ending.",
        "38. gxf6 Rxf6": "Black takes the rook.",
        "39. h5": "Good move. White makes a threat of Rg6, entering a won king and pawn ending.",
        "39... Kb5": "Black defends against the threat and activates his king.\nEVALUATE:\nMaterial - even\nKing safety - in this endgame, king safety is not a critial factor\nSpecial features - White has a powerful passed pawn on the 5th rank, Black has a Queenside pawn majority.\nActivity - White king is well centralised. Blacks king is placed to help attack the queenside pawns. Whites rook is well placed on the second rank where it can go behind the passed pawn. Blacks rook will likely go passive to prevent the advanced passed pawn advancing.\nConclusion: White has the advantage.",
        "40. Rh2": "White moves his rook behind the passed pawn.",
        "40... Rh6": "Black prevents the pawn advancing.",
        "41. Kf5": "White moves his king towards the defending rook.",
        "41... Kb4": "Black advances his king on the White pawns. ",
        "42. Kg5": "White attacks the Black rook",
        "42... Rh8": "Black defends the rook.",
        "43. h6": "White pushes the passed pawn.",
        "43... Ka3": "Black advances his king.\nThe Black plan is to sacrifice the rook for the passed pawn at the last possible moment, and then use his king to take the White pawns. And then try to play with the Black pawns against the White king and rook.\nThis is a excellent plan, as the White king will be quite far away from the Queenside.",
        "44. h7": "White advances the passed pawn.",
        "44... b5": "Black advances his Queenside pawns.",
        "45. Kf6": "White moves the king towards the defending Black rook.\nBlack is prepared to sacrifice the rook and and then capture the White pawns.\nUnfortunately Black resigned here, but he should have played on as the ending would have been quite tricky for White to win."
