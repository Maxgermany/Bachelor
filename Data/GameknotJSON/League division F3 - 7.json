    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "In this game I think my opponent failed to appreciate that it is not good to send your pawns in without protection and then spend all your time trying to protect them instead of protecting your king.",
        "1... e5": "I started with pawn to e4 and black replied with e5.",
        "2. Nf3 Nf6": "We mirrored each other with knight to f3 and knight to f6.  ",
        "3. Nc3 Bc5": "I moved knight to c3 and black answered with DB to c5 attacking pawn at f2.",
        "4. d4 Bd6": "I moved pawn to d4 and DB retreated to d6.",
        "5. Bb5 c6": "I moved my LB to b5 protected by c3 knight and black moved pawn to c6 attacking my LB.",
        "6. Bc4 O-O": "I moved my LB back to c4 and black castled.",
        "7. d5 c5": "I pushed pawn to d5 and black moved pawn to c5.",
        "8. O-O a6": "I castled and black moved pawn to a6.",
        "9. Bg5 a5": "I moved DB to g5 attacking knight at g6 and black pushed his pawn to a5.",
        "10. Ne2 b6": "I brought my C knight back to e2 as I want to bring them together at f3 and g3. Black moved pawn out to b6 supporting his c and a pawns.",
        "11. Ng3 a4": "I moved my E knight to g3 and black pushed his a pawn again to a4.",
        "12. a3 Ra5": "I now stop a pawn's progress with pawn to a3.  I do not intend letting black into the queen side.  Black moves his rook down to a5 but I don't intend letting him move it out of that square.",
        "13. Qe2 b5": "I moved my queen to e2 protecting my LB at c4.  Black pushes his pawn down the b file attacking my LB.",
        "14. b4 cxb4": "I push my b2 pawn to b4 and black takes with pawn at c5.",
        "15. Bb3 bxa3": "I move my LB to b3 attacking a4 pawn backed by pawn at c2.  Black takes my a3 pawn with his b4 pawn.  He now has 2 pawns on a file.",
        "16. Ba2 b4": "I move my LB to a2 and black moves pawn to b4.",
        "17. Rab1 b3": "I move my rook out to b1 attacking pawn at b3.  Black has a choice of taking either c2 pawn or a2 LB. ",
        "18. Nd2 Ba6": "I move my f3 knight to d2 attacking the b3 pawn.  Black moves his LB to a6 now pointing at my queen on e2.  Its a party on the a file!",
        "19. Qf3 bxa2": "I move my queen out to f3 and black takes LB with b pawn and now there are 3 pawns on the 'A' file!  At this stage black could have taken my F rook with his bishop and that would have left me with a pawn ab out to take my B rook so would have created difficulties.  When I look at my king side I see I cannot progress with the queen still at d8 so I would have been hoping that my opponent would move this soon!  There was the f5 square for my knight which would be safe. ",
        "20. Rba1 Qb6": "I move my b rook to a1 blocking 'A' pawns.  Black brings queen to b6 and takes control of b file.  Now the queen has moved so I can start my attack while keeping things on queenside held back.",
        "21. Rxa2 Bb4": "I take pawn at a2 with my rook and black moves DB down to protect a3 pawn and attacking my knight at d2.",
        "22. c3 Bc5": "I move pawn to c3 and attack DB at b4 which moves back to c5.  My pawn was protected by queen at f3.  I am not sure I was aware when the bishop went to c5 of the implication to f2.  However I knew my next move would be rook to b1 and the black queen would be at risk so was not concerned about attack on f2.  If black had proceeded with this move then it would have changed things.  Queens would have been exchanged and game would definitely have gone a different way.",
        "23. Rb1 Qc7": "I now move 'F' rook across to b1 and take control of b file protected by knight at d2 so black queen moves away to c7.  If I was black I would have moved my a5 rook out to b5 as it was protected by a6 and put up a fight for the b file.  If black had got the DB at c5 out of the way the queen would have been able to get down the c file and defend.  I am not sure the pawns were worth fighting over while the king was left with a knight and a rook.",
        "24. c4 Bd4": "I move my pawn to c4 and DB moves down to d4 attacking f2 pawn.  The knight at d2 and my c4 pawn are a great pair as the a6 LB is thwarted by this move and if the LB were to move to b7 would only be blocked by pawns on the h1 to a8 diagonal.",
        "25. Nf5 d6": "I move my g knight to f5 threatening to take pawn at g7 or checking at d7 but queen would capture so this move is not available.  Black moves pawn to d6 which allows queen to protect pawn at f7 and to cover d7 and e7 squares.",
        "26. Bxf6 Bxc4": "I take black's f6 knight with my DB and now attacking g7.  Black moves his LB to d4 attacking my rook at a2.",
        "27. Nh6+ Kh8": "With my next move I move my knight to h6 checking the king who moves out of check to h8.  I did not leave my queen on f3 as my DB was still there but I could have moved up to f5 but I may have been concerned that queen would have been under attack where on g3 black pawns were shielding the queen.  I knew I could take LB with my d2 knight but this piece was occupied with covering the B rook.  I was getting ready for mate so did not see any reason for captures at this stage.",
        "28. Qg3 gxf6": "Black captures my DB with g7 pawn and I move my queen to g3 attacking h8.",
        "29. Rxa3 f5": "Black has not had a chance to take my rook on a2 and I now capture another pawn at a3.  Black moves down one of his doubled pawns on f file to f5.",
        "30. Nxf5 Bc5": "I capture f5 pawn with my knight and black moves his DBfrom d4 to c5.  Also the DB is now attacking my rook at a3.",
        "31. Qg7#": "My next move ended the game.  I assumed that black's last move would have been to move rook across to g8 or move f7 pawn so queen could defend and we would still be playing on."
