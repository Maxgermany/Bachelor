        "1. d4": "This was one of 6 Gameknot games I played simultaneously with my opponent. I lost two, drew 3 and won this. Some of those draws were very lucky, when my opponent kindly offered me a draw although I was a clear pawn down in a couple of them. In this game he loses as one of his knights goes out on a solo run to win a pawn, but ends up losing itself for two pawns. I manage to convert a lead of a knight for two pawns into a win - but we both make a lot os mistakes along the way!",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nc3": "In a couple of games he had beaten me very quickly and very easily with the Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit, after 1. d4 Nf6, 2. Nc3 d5 3.e4. I wanted to try and find out what he would play against it himself.",
        "2... c5": "But instead he transposes into a Benoni. This version of the Benoni is considered better for white however, as the normal c2-c4 has not been played. the square c4 is available for a knight or bishop.",
        "3. d5 e6": "g6, d6 and e5 are all more common at this point.",
        "4. e4": "I reinforce my centre. ",
        "4... d6": "He prevents the d5-d6 push.",
        "5. Bg5": "I'm following the Gameknot opening databases as usual!",
        "5... Be7": "He develops.",
        "6. Bb5+": "I throw in a check.",
        "6... Bd7": "He blocks.",
        "7. dxe6": "I take.",
        "7... fxe6": "He takes back.",
        "8. Bxd7+": "I exchange bishops.",
        "8... Nbxd7": "He takes back. Interestingly on the World database taking back with the queen is the only move given. Taking with the knight can hardly be bad surely?",
        "9. Nge2": "As played in longtail99 (1922) vs. sualksnh (2472), in a tournament called \"Play the Trompowsky Attack!\" so obviously with a different move order.",
        "9... a6": "That game continued with Ne5 instead of a6. a6 is given as a mistake by the Post Match Computer Analysis (PMCA).",
        "10. a4": "So this is the first move I did entirely off my own bat. PMCA says it is a mistake and prefers Nf4! Oh well.....",
        "10... Ne5": "So this move comes in at last.",
        "11. f4": "So I hit the knight.",
        "11... Neg4": "And of it goes, on a solo adventure from which it will never come back.",
        "12. h3": "I hit the knight.",
        "12... Ne3": "Knight comes in.",
        "13. Qd3": "I prevent the knight escaping to c4.",
        "13... Nxg2+": "He takes the pawn.",
        "14. Kf2": "I hit the knight, which finds it has no escape squares.",
        "14... Nxf4": "So it takes a pawn",
        "15. Bxf4": "and I take the knight. I am knight for two pawns up now.",
        "15... e5": "Attacking the bishop, but making his d5 square weak and his d6 pawn backward.",
        "16. Be3": "I retreat.",
        "16... O-O": "He castles.",
        "17. Kg2": "I move my king to a safer square.",
        "17... Qe8": "He prepares to use his queen against my king.",
        "18. Kh2": "So I move it again. I actually will have lovely open f and g files against his king, and more crucially there is just one open file, the f file, on which I have excellent chances of exchanging off rooks. Of course, being materially up, I want to exchange off pieces, but not pawns...",
        "18... Qh5": "The queen comes out.",
        "19. Rhg1": "I prevent the knight check.",
        "19... Kh8": "He moves his king to a safer square.",
        "20. Raf1": "I mobilise my other rook.",
        "20... Ng4+": "This check is actually a horrible mistake. I thought \"I can't play 21. Rxg4 as then he can play Rxf1\". However I missed 22. Ng3, forking queen and rook, so winning the rook back. I think I missed this, because I was a bit in awe of my opponent, who had beaten me in one game, and was winning in a couple of others, and it just didn't occur to me that he might accidently throw away another knight!",
        "21. Kg2": "But hey, I'm still winning surely?",
        "21... Nxe3+": "Piece exchanges favour me, and his bishop and two pawns are certainly not worth my two knights. d5 is going to be a tremendous square for one of them soon, surely?",
        "22. Qxe3": "So I take back.",
        "22... Bg5": "He hits my queen.",
        "23. Qg3": "Queen comes across.",
        "23... Qh6": "Preparing Bf4, but it only results in more piece exchanges.",
        "24. Rxf8+": "So I trade rooks.",
        "24... Rxf8": "He recaptures.",
        "25. Rf1": "I contest the open file.",
        "25... Rxf1": "He takes.",
        "26. Kxf1": "I keep my queen on the f4 square.",
        "26... Bf4": "This doesn't actually achieve anything, just allows more exchanges, which favours me.",
        "27. Nxf4": "Computer says this is a mistake, and Qg4 was better. Maybe, but this is simpler.",
        "27... exf4": "Computer prefers the queen recapture, but that allows me to exchange queens, and simple win in the ending.",
        "28. Qg4": "So now I do play Qg4",
        "28... g5": "He has to make a flight square for his king.",
        "29. Qc8+": "I throw in a queen check.",
        "29... Kg7": "Forced!",
        "30. Qxb7+": "Now only one pawn for the knight.",
        "30... Kf6": "His king comes up.",
        "31. Nd5+": "Knight finally reaches d5.",
        "31... Ke5": "Not Ke6, Qe7 mate!",
        "32. Qe7+": "So I check.",
        "32... Kd4": "King up again.",
        "33. Qf6+": "Computer says this is a mistake, but I think it is by far the easier way to win.",
        "33... Qxf6": "So he takes.",
        "34. Nxf6": "I take back, hitting the h pawn.",
        "34... h6": "Pawn advances.",
        "35. Ng8": "Ne8 also wins, but this is better. I need to go after his potentially strong kingside pawns.",
        "35... h5": "He saves his h pawn.",
        "36. Nf6": "I attack it again. At this point we did a deal, at my suggestion. He resigned this, and in return I resigned a game where I was 2 pawns down without any compensation. I was a bit surprised at his resignation comment. \"I think I could draw this with good play...but as you insist I'll resign\". I tend to disagree, I think this position is pretty hopeless for black. He has only one pawn for the knight. He is losing one of his kingside pawns for my e pawn. My king easily blocks his passed f pawn. My knight can quickly and easily jump from the queenside to the kingside, as necessary. But I'd be interested in your view near reader! So please leave a comment or two, and please rate it on the star system."
