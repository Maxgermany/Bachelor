        "1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 b6 3. Bf4": "My favourite.",
        "3... Bb7 4. Nbd2 Nf6 5. e3": "Here, as black, I would have gone for my dsb with Nh5.",
        "5... c5 6. c3": "This scheme provides me with nice settings, much less \"attacheable\" than c4 ones. ",
        "6... Nc6 7. h3": "I've seen my opponen is not fond with the Nh5 idea, but this is not to provide my bishop of a square to hide as to prepare a pawn storm. ",
        "7... Be7 8. g4 O-O": "Thank you, just where I wanted you to be. ",
        "9. Rg1": "This is to unpin the f3 knight and to prepare h4.",
        "9... cxd4 10. exd4": "My queenside keeps closed. It is supposed to be the shield for my king, after o-o-o.",
        "10... Rc8": "Good, preventing Qc2 (Nb4)",
        "11. h4": "Just wait for me... :-)",
        "11... Nd5 12. Bh2": "A little trap.",
        "12... Bxh4": "He falls in it. This just helps me, opening the h column. ",
        "13. Bd6": "...but this move was too juicy to delay. ",
        "13... Re8": "Now, the trap clicks.",
        "14. g5": "He cannot save the bishop, but my king is becoming very exposed, and castling appears very far. ",
        "14... Ne3": "Nice attempt. ",
        "15. Qb1": "It was important for me to keep the queen active, and I needed it looking to h7.",
        "15... Nxf1 16. Kxf1": "Not with the rook, and not with the knight, because of Nf3 needs protection. This also keeps my king out of the Re8's action (as black, I would have played e5, probably). ",
        "16... Ba6+": "I considered to shield with c4, but I didn't like b5.",
        "17. Ke1": "Well, back to the e column. I thought that now e5 was almost the only black chance. ",
        "17... Bxf2+ 18. Kxf2": "Well, THIS is an exposed king. I am lucky the Bd6 is untouchable, and cramps him a lot. ",
        "18... f6": "No, the f column should not be opened!",
        "19. Rh1 g6": "I thought Rxh7, and if KxR, Qh1+, followed by Qh6. But I wasn't sure it was enough. ",
        "20. Ne4": "Bringing more firepower to the enemy's field. ",
        "20... fxg5 21. Nexg5": "He can now attack the f column, but without much effect. ",
        "21... Re7": "Intelligent. Returning the exchange in order to free his position. Now I have to be very \"os\u00e9\", if I want to keep my attack. ",
        "22. Nxh7": "The Nf6+ threat is very dangerous for black. His best answer is Rg7, IMO. ",
        "22... Rxh7": "But he went greedy, and this is almost mortal. I could have gone RxR, KxR, Qh1+, but after Kg7 I couldn't see a clear win. ",
        "23. Qxg6+": "My queen returns! ...at the cost of a piece, but the presence of the First Lady into the king whorts it. ",
        "23... Rg7 24. Qh5": "Qh8+ is not checkmate, though. ",
        "24... Qe8 25. Qh8+ Kf7": "Again, I have to play very strong to make my attack successful. ",
        "26. Ng5+": "The nice one. Tempo is all in chess. ",
        "26... Rxg5 27. Rh7+ Kg6": "I was in doubt if to follow with the queen or the rook. Now, with more time, I realize that Rh6+, Kf5 (Kf7, Qf6+, Kg8, Rh8#), Qf6+, Kg4, Rg1#, but on the spot I didn't. Pity. ",
        "28. Rg7+ Kf5": "Kf6, Rg8+ and I win. Now, I had to bring in the other rook, and get rid of defensive forces, so...",
        "29. Rxg5+ Kxg5": "Tempo is all. ",
        "30. Rg1+": "It is funny how long my queen keeps \"en prise\" undisturbed.- ",
        "30... Kf5 31. Qh7+ Kf6 32. Qh6+": "Kf7 loses to Rg7#.",
        "32... Kf5 33. Qf4#": "So it worked, for once :-)"
