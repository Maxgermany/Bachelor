        "1. d4": "A rather secure and good opening move.",
        "1... d5": "Probably the best response.",
        "2. Be3": "A bit defensive; a move to the fourth rank is more aggressive and probably better. ",
        "2... Bf5": "Aggressive.",
        "3. c3": "Bolstering the defensive formation; though White should have moved the knight out first.",
        "3... Nc6": "Black remains aggressive, though not stupidly so.",
        "4. h3": "Setting up 5.g4 and attacking the bishop.",
        "4... Bg6": "Black wants to keep the presence on this diagonal and moves the bishop back to avoid threat of capture.",
        "5. g4": "White follows through and attacks the kingside, or at least sets up for it.",
        "5... f6": "Black, meanwhile, is looking to expand his center presence.",
        "6. Bg2": "White's forces are gathering on the kingside, while Black's forces look rather weak.",
        "6... e5": "Time to get going.",
        "7. f4": "White wishes to keep his center strong.",
        "7... exf4": "Black is trying to get White's forces even more concentrated (and cramped) on one side.",
        "8. Bxf4": "White captures and has a decent setup.",
        "8... Be4": "Time, now, to start attacking White, or at least blow up the formation.",
        "9. Nf3": "White likes his formation and will block the attack, though this does severely limit the scope of the bishop.",
        "9... Bd6": "Now the bishop standoff is complete.",
        "10. Be3": "White is retreating towards the center.",
        "10... Nge7": "Time to get the other pieces involved.",
        "11. Nbd2": "Attacks the bishop.",
        "11... Ng6": "Black has the bishop protected and wants to get the knight in there.",
        "12. Nxe4": "And White will follow through.",
        "12... dxe4": "Retaking the knight.",
        "13. Nh4": "A bad move to get the knight out of the way; Nd2 was much better.",
        "13... Nxh4": "A break; Black takes the undefended bishop and has good position with his knight to harass White.",
        "14. Bxe4": "White needs to get the bishop out of the way and will take the undefended pawn.",
        "14... Qe7": "Black sees that the bishop is undefended and will get the queen into the game by threatening both bishops on the file.",
        "15. Bxc6+": "That takes care of the one bishop.",
        "15... bxc6": "No other choice.",
        "16. Bf2": "This protects against 16...Bg3+ and attacks the knight.",
        "16... Ng2+": "Black takes his other secure check.",
        "17. Kd2": "Not a good move; Kf1 would have been much better and would have avoided exposing the king.",
        "17... Bf4+": "Keeping up with the checks.",
        "18. e3": "A decent block, though not ideal.",
        "18... Nxe3": "Rather than just check again, the knight attacks the queen and sets up a discovered check.",
        "19. Bxe3": "White will part with his last minor piece; he has little choice.",
        "19... Qxe3+": "Now Black has infiltrated White's position badly.",
        "20. Kc2": "The only legal move.",
        "20... Qe4+": "Black now forces the king to really run away.",
        "21. Qd3": "Or trade queens.",
        "21... Qxd3+": "And Black will.",
        "22. Kxd3": "Again, the only move to be made.",
        "22... O-O": "Black doesn't have much opportunity to get great pawn structure and will instead get the rooks going, exploiting the extra piece.",
        "23. Rae1": "White needs to attack soon.",
        "23... Rfe8": "Black is perfectly willing to trade pieces away and make the advantage of the extra bishop that much more dramatic.",
        "24. Re4": "This move is rather superfluous other than giving White an attack on the bishop.  Not a bad idea though.",
        "24... Rxe4": "The best move.",
        "25. Kxe4": "Of course.",
        "25... Bd6": "The bishop is moved to safety.",

        "26... Re8+": "A rather cheap but easy check.",
        "27. Kd3": "White will retreat a bit and defend his pawns.",
        "27... a5": "Black is looking to eliminate pawns as well.",
        "28. b5": "White ought to have taken the a-pawn.",
        "28... cxb5": "Black will take the pawn.",
        "29. d5": "Aggressiveness till the end.",
        "29... b4": "Same for black.",
        "30. Kc4": "The king trying to make a move.",
        "30... bxc3": "Black is rather preventing this.",
        "31. Kxc3": "The only decent move.",
        "31... Re3+": "Time to start picking off White's pawns, and this check starts it.",
        "32. Kc4": "White is determined not to get pinned back.",
        "32... Re5": "Black will set up for his next move.",

        "35... Rxc6": "Taking the pawn.",
        "36. Kd5": "The king needs to attack; waiting around for Black to do something is certain death.",

        "39. gxf5": "Nothing else to do.",
        "39... gxf5": "Likewise.",
        "40. h5": "There is really no other move.",
        "40... Kg7": "The king's services are finally needed.",

        "50... Kxh7": "White's last hope is gone.",
        "51. Kf3": "White will at least get the bishop.",
