        "2... d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bb3 Nc6 5. c3": "White would be more active with d4 and a chance to play c4 later.",
        "5... e5 6. h3": "I understand that a pin is not desirable, but this is not necessary. A knight on d2 and queen on c2 solves the problem.",
        "6... Nf6 7. a3": "Unnecessary again. Nf3 is much more natural.",
        "7... Be7 8. d3": "A passive move. Black has more space and white should be concerned about its impending constriction. ",
        "8... Be6 9. Nf3 Qd7": "Setting up bishop takes h3 threats.",
        "10. Be3 d4": "Double attack. I wanted to continue to build on my space advantage, but I exposed my bishop to an exchange. My light-squared bishop is better not exchanged. ",
        "11. cxd4 exd4 12. Bd2 O-O 13. O-O": "What I wanted.",
        "13... Bxh3": "I wasn't exactly sure of the circumstances that would continue, but I knew I had enough ammunition to make it a worthy attack.",
        "14. Bf4": "Not so bad. Bxf7+ coupled with Ng5 might have resulted in some interesting lines. ",

        "22. Qd1 Ne5": "Besides attacking the d-pawn, the knight can easily provide assistance for a kingside attack. ",
        "23. Ndf3 Bg4 24. Qd2": "A critical error that open up white's kingisde even further. ",
        "24... Nxf3+ 25. Nxf3 Bxf3 26. gxf3 Nh5": "Trying to produce strong threats with a knight on f4.",
        "27. Qe2": "Backrank mating threats.",
        "27... Qg6+ 28. Kf1 Kf8": "Even though black's queen is still on the board, it can't make any viable threats against my king. ",
        "29. Qe4": "Asking for an exchange to take out any sting in my attack.",
        "29... Qxe4": "I have a pawn majority on the kingside, so why not exchange?",
        "30. fxe4 Nf4": "An important move to keep white at my whim.",
