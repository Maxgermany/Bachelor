        "1. e4": "Not much to say about this one. Playing black I usually respond to e4 with some variation of the Sicilian. Here White plays to transpose into an English with 2. c4.  I formulated a plan early which consisted of aggressively posting my knight on d4 then bearing down on the Queen-side, both points I was able to do. There is little annotation as the game plays itself out. ",
        "1... c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nf3 d6 4. d3 Nf6 5. Bg5 e5 6. Nc3 h6 7. Bh4 Be7 8. Nd5": "Was hoping that he would play this as I wanted to pin his knight to his queen, take, then post my knight on d4. This is possible without this move but some other moves could have prevented this. I thought that White may play Be2 and try to castle, then I would trade knights, take on f3, then post the knight. Although it played out slightly differently the end result was the same. ",
        "8... Bg4 9. Nxe7 Qxe7 10. h3 Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Nd4": "Forcing the queen to retreat to defend against the fork on c2. ",
        "12. Qd1 O-O 13. Be2 g5 14. Bg3 a6 15. a3 b5 16. b3 Rab8 17. a4 bxc4 18. bxc4 Rb2": "Black threatens to win the bishop or can now employ the fork at c2. White resigned. \n\n*Just as a note the last few pawn moves may have been out of order for white (playing black I remember what I did) however this was the final board position reached so they couldn't have been too terribly re-constructed.
