        "6. Bg5": "Here my opponent's intentions are obvious. Most likely he wanted to play Nd5 or Ne4 next turn to put immense pressure on my knight on f6. However, I catch him by surprise very quickly.",
        "6... Bxf2+": "Here I intend on temporarily sacrificing my bishop to get a slight advantage in material.",
        "7. Kxf2": "Sac accepted.",
        "7... Ng4+": "With this check, I'll get a bishop back and jump ahead in material by a pawn...or so I thought.",
        "8. Kf3": "A horrific blunder. 8.Kf3?? leaves the king in a vulnerable position in the center of the board. Moving back to either c1 or d1 would've been better. Being ahead in material would be nice, but a bigger prize is in sight.",
        "8... Nd4+": "The first move in a mate in 3. White resigned here. Here are the possible continuations:\n\n9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 c6++ (my conditional moves were set for this continuation)\n9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 Be6++\n9. Ke5 Bf5+ 10. Kd5 c6++\n\nI was very fortunate to get a golden opportunity this early in the game. The main lesson that I got out of this game is that it's almost never a good idea to bring your king out to the center of the board this early in the game. It's far too risky with this many pieces on the board."
