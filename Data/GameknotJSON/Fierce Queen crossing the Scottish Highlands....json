        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4": "introducing the Scotch party, I picked up in a wild blitz game recently: it yielded good results; Black has to react: of course, letting White play d5 is no option...",
        "3... exd4 4. Nxd4": "Classical Scotch: White could consider the Scotch gambit and ignore d4 for now, after Bc4, Bc5, c3!, or play c3, dxc3, Nxc3, with interesting play for both sides...",
        "4... Bc5 5. Nf5": "theory usually continues with Be3, Qf6, c3, Nge7, Nc2, Bxe3, Nxe3, 0-0, or Be3, Bb6, Bc4, d6, Nc3, Nf6; all this being said, I wanted to try something else: however you look at it, g7 is still a bit of an issue...",
        "5... Qf6 6. Nc3": "Blacks' response is in line with theory, and the safest: but now, White is introducing an early Nd5, and Nf6 is not at hand anymore; not very common, in this opening...",
        "6... Nge7": "a weaker position for Blacks' KN: but pretty much forced...",
        "7. Be3": "now, Be3 yields more result...",
        "7... Bxe3": "not good, in this variation: better Bb4, Nxe7, Bxc3+, bxc3, Qxe7, and eliminate the White Knights before it is too late...",
        "8. Nxe3": "in this constellation, White has two Knights that can travel to square d5...",
        "8... O-O 9. Qf3": "not good is Qxf3, gxf3, d6, Nb5: also Nd5 after this move, is not nice; both threatening pawn c7...",
        "9... Qd4": "the best...",
        "10. Rd1 Qc5": "or Qb4, Nc4, Re8, a3, Qc5...",
        "11. Qe2 a6 12. Ned5 Nb4": "the first signs of fatigue in the Black camp; better of course Nxd5, exd5, Na7, d6, Qb4, dxc7, b5!...",
        "13. Nxe7+ Qxe7 14. a3 Nc6 15. Nd5": "finally: this forces the Queen back to home base; White has won the opening: Qd6, is met with Nb6, and Qe5 is met with finally c3; after Qg5, f4, Qd8: also, White is ready for f4 or b4...",
        "15... Qd8 16. f4": "or Qh5, d6, f4...",
        "16... Re8 17. Qf3 f5": "too eager for play: best is d6, Bd3, Nd4, Qf2, Nc6, 0-0, Bg4; this is only helping White...",
        "18. Bd3 Nd4": "also very dubious: better d6, 0-0, Be6, c3, Bxd5...",
        "19. Qf2": "Blacks' center will not hold: he has to retreat or he will lose the misplaced Knight; after Nc6, 0-0!, fxe4, Rde1!, White is already better...",
        "19... c5": "of course, this can never be a sound move: by now, the move c3 is ready to enter the game...",
        "20. c3 fxe4": "after Nc6, e5, d6 (Black has to cover c5), Ne3!, Blacks' center collapses...",
        "21. Bc4 e3 22. Qg3 Nc2+ 23. Ke2 d6 24. Bb3 Be6": "all pretty much forced: here however, Black had to play Nxa3, bxa3, Kh8, with at least two pawns for the lost Knight; with the LSB landing on square c2,  White will walk right over Blacks' position...",
        "25. Bxc2 Bxd5 26. Rxd5 Qb6 27. Rb1 Qb5+ 28. Bd3 Qd7 29. Bc4 Kf8 30. Rh5 g6": "it is hard for Black the find the better moves, if any: however, Re4, Rxh7, Rxc4, was to be preferred over this any day...",
        "31. Qg5": "tightening the thumb screws further: after gxh5???, Qf6+, it is time to make up the obituaries...",
        "31... d5": "trying a last desperado breakout attempt: better is Re7, Qf6+, Rf7...",
        "32. Bxd5 Re6 33. Bxe6": "all forced by now: and all this, for just one moot check...",
        "33... Qd2+ 34. Kf3 gxh5 35. f5": "White has no fear for Qf2+, Ke4, Qc2+, Ke5, with an upcoming mate after Kf6: for Black that is...",
        "35... h6": "at this point, one of the moves that leads straight to mate: better Ke8, f6, Qd6...",
        "36. Qf6+ Ke8 37. Qf7+ Kd8 38. f6 Qd6 39. Kxe3": "the culprit is arrested: meanwhile, Black is fighting an upcoming mate on the other side of the board...",
        "39... Qe5+ 40. Kf3 Qd6 41. Bf5 Ra7 42. Re1 Qc6+ 43. Kf2 b5": "Black finally gets to develop the Queens' wing: here, I announced mate in three...",
        "44. Rd1+ Rd7 45. Rxd7+ Kc8 46. Qf8#": "the sound of war pipes and drums, must have been ringing in Blacks' ears a long while after this..."
