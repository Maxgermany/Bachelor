        "1. e4 e6": "French defense.",
        "2. Nc3 b6": "Pd5 is the most common response for black.  Not criticizing, just saying.",
        "3. Nf3 Nc6 4. d4 Bb4 5. Bd2 Bxc3": "I don't know why this isn't in the database--it looks like a fine move for black to me.  Though white has concentrated a lot of power to the center of the board with the exchange.",
        "6. Bxc3 Bb7 7. Bd3 Nf6 8. e5 Nd5 9. Bd2 h6 10. Bc4 Nde7 11. a3 O-O 12. Bd3 d5 13. Qc1": "Don't forget en passant--Pxd5.  Not that this would have been white's best move--Qc1 has as much potential.",
        "13... Ng6 14. Bxh6": "Brave, trading the bishop for two king pawns.  But they are important pawns, probably worth the trade after the queen gets down there with her castle battering ram.",
        "14... Kh7": "Ah, black declines.  Ng5+ would be interesting.  KxB results in Nxf7+ (discovered check by the queen), and the black queen falls into darkness.  Well, gets traded for the horse.  Of course, if the king backs up the bishop is again in peril.",
        "15. Bg5 Nce7 16. Nh4 f6 17. exf6 gxf6 18. Nxg6 Nxg6 19. Be3 f5 20. Bg5 Qe8 21. O-O Rg8 22. Re1 Qf7": "Better to bring another, less expensive piece to protect the e pawn, such as Bc8 or Nf8.  Qe3 gives white two pieces on it, but with black's h file open the king will be vulnerable.",
        "23. Qe3 Rae8": "Black needed to move the queen--Qg7, or possibly Kg7.",
        "24. Qh3+": "Here Nh4, 25. QxN, Qh5, 26. QxQ, Kf7 drags the game out--though black's future turns bleak with such enormous material loss.",
        "24... Kg7 25. Qh6#": ""
