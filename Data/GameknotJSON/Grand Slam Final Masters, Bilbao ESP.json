MightyViking : Black sacs his king so he can't be mated... junglebee : since black can't play Kh8 due to Qg7+ he has to keep his rook on the seventh. Meanwhile white will bring his king up to c6 or d6 and then play Qg7+ Rxg7 fxg7 and black's knight will be trapped.' junglebee : Kxd3 Nf6? How can the knight get to f6? junglebee : it is zugzwang here. Black has to give up the pawn. White will take d3 and then bring his king to d6 or c6.
