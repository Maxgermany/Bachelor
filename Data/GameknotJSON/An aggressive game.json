        "48. axb3 Kd4": "Carrying out my plan\r\nI wasn't particulary worried about the c pawn advancing, because i could position my rook so it would always attack it\r\nAlso if he attempted protecting the b pawn with Ra1 and to b1, Kc2 would take care of that\r\nAlso his king was to far away to help on the queenside attack, and i could always use the pawn on the h file to try to promote",
        "49. c5 Rb5": "threathing the pawn, as well prepearing to move my rook onto the c file \r\nAlso if the rook decided to attack the undefened h pawn, and then try to protect the white b pawn, then moving the rook to c3 would take care of that",

        "56. Rb8 Rxc7": "Now I could easily check the king, make him move, advance my king, and then promote\r\nit would be taken, and i would still have a second pawn, which would win me the game\r\nRealizing this he resigned.\r\n\r\nI hope you have enjoyed this game, and i hope you will comment\r\nFeel free to send me a message if you have any questions or comments\r\n"
