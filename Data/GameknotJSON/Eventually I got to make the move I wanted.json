I'm worried about him playing Nb4 eventually, and his queen is making it hard on my queen because of the pawn on b3.\nd4 is a theme in this opening, so let's see if it helps out.",
        "13... e4 14. Ne5 Ne7": "I'm worried about him playing f6 to trap the knight.",
        "15. Ra5": "I don't see anything better, and this might work out okay. Now, if he plays f6, I can meet it with Bc4 and skewer the queen.",
        "15... Bb4 16. Bc4": "He says he missed this move."
