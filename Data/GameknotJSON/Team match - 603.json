        "1. e4": "This is a game with one of my favorite combinations I've played on GameKnot.  I'll skip the opening analysis for the most part and focus on the end of the game.  Enjoy.",
        "1... Nf6 2. e5 Nd5 3. d4 d6 4. Nf3 Bg4 5. Be2": "Alekhine's Defense, modern, Flohr variation\n\nRather than capturing the pawn on e5, black chooses to attack the knight on f3, which white unpins.",
        "5... e6 6. O-O Nc6 7. c4 Nb6 8. exd6 cxd6 9. Nc3 Be7 10. d5 Bxf3 11. Bxf3 Ne5 12. dxe6 Nxf3+ 13. Qxf3 fxe6 14. Re1": "Probably a mistake, since black can now defend both pawns with one move.  The immediate Qxb7 is probably best.",
        "14... Qd7 15. b3 O-O-O": "This move sets up the ever-interesting scenario of opposite-sided castling, so this game will probably be decided by whose attack is faster.",
        "16. Be3 Rdf8 17. Qe4": "This sets up the threat of winning a pawn with 18. Bxb6 axb6 19. Qxe6",
        "17... Bf6": "Black is able to stall the threat; however, blocking off the half-open f-file is is probably not the best idea.",
        "18. Rac1 Kb8": "Apparently, black overlooked the threat of white winning a pawn.",
        "19. Bxb6 axb6 20. Qxe6 Qc6": "Being a pawn down with worse structure, avoiding the queen trade is preferable for black.",
        "21. Nb5": "This was probably the first critical decision of the game, whether to bring the knight to b5 or d5.  Centralizing the knight with d5 is the move that most players would prefer, but I actually like the knight in more direct opposition of the enemy king.  By controlling both a7 and c7, the black king is now potentially vulnerable to back-rank checkmates if one of the black rooks comes off the back rank.\n\nThis move also has the benefit of directly threatening the pawn on d6.",
        "21... Be5": "The most logical defense of the pawn, as black now has three pieces aimed at white's king.",
        "22. Rcd1": "Continuing to pressure the weak pawn on d6.",
        "22... Rf6": "Gaining the ability to double the rooks with tempo against the white queen.",
        "23. Qd5 Rhf8": "Black has a dangerous-looking setup, but white actually can force a win in this position.  The first sequence is relatively obvious, but can you find the follow-up move as well?",
        "24. Rxe5": "!\nThis move just begs to be played.  If black plays anything except dxe5, white will simply be able to go a piece up, having a winning game.  Note that if 24. ... Qxd5, then 25. Rexd5.",
        "24... dxe5 25. Qxe5+ Ka8": "If 25. ...Rd6, then 26. Qxd6 Qxd6 27. Nxd6, leaving white a piece up.\nIf 25. ...Kc8, then there is the very aesthetic 26. Na7#.\n\nNc7+ will most likely lead to a draw, as the black king can shuffle between a6, a7, and a8 while the rooks and queen counterattack.\n\nWith that in mind, white is able to force a win in this position.  Can you find it?",
        "26. Qe7": "!!\nOther attempts fail to moves such as 26) ... Qc5 or Rxf2\nThere is a nice double-threat from Qe7.  The first is 27) Qa3+ Kb8 28) Qa7+ Kc8 29) Qa8+.  Note that if white tried to approach a3 via b2 instead, then black would be able to stop the threat with 26) ... Qc5.  With the white queen on e7, however, the second threat comes into play.\n\nIf black now tries to defend with 26) ... Qc5, then 27) Rd8+ Rxd8 28) Qxd8+ Qc8 29) Qxc8#.  Note that if 27) ... Qc8, then 28) Qa3+ Kb8 29) Qa7#.\n\nFinally, if black tries to defend with 26) ... Kb8, then white still plays 27) Qa3, as there is no way for black to stop Qa7+ and Qa8# without drastic loss of material, as the knight and rook perfectly lock in the black king.\n\nThe particularly interesting bit about this entire combination is that it all hinged on the decision to move the knight to b5 rather than d5.",
        "26... Rc8": "Black apparently doesn't see the threat of Qa3+.",
        "27. Qa3+": "Black resigns, since 27) ... Kb8 28) Qa7# is unavoidable."
