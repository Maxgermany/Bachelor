        "1. e4": "The major theme of this game is the strength of the Bishop pair in an open position.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6": "The Accelerated Dragon ... Not the most common way to play the Sicilian at present, but a player like Bent Larsen have used it quite often throughout his career. One big difference from the \"normal\" Dragon is, that Black hasn\u00b4t played his pawn to d6 yet. In some lines this gives the opportunity to play it to d5 directly - like in this game. If you want to study this opening, I can recommend the book \"The Sicilian Accelerated Dragon\" by GM Peter Heine Nielsen and Carsten Hansen.",
        "5. Nc3": "Another main line here is the Maroczy Bind: 5. c4.",
        "5... Bg7 6. Be3 Nf6 7. Qd2 O-O 8. f3": "Black can still choose the traditional Dragon by playing 8. - d6, but now the d5-push is possible.",
        "8... d5 9. O-O-O dxe4 10. Nxc6 Qxd2+ 11. Rxd2 bxc6 12. Nxe4": "The last few moves has been more or less forced. Now 12. - Nxe4 13. fxe4 is about equal, though I think Black\u00b4s isolated pawn at c6 is a bit weaker than White\u00b4s on e4. I had another plan: To win the exchange ...",
        "12... Nd5 13. Bc5 Bh6": "Exploiting the fact that both White\u00b4s King and Rook are on the h6-c1 diagonal. Black wins the exchange, but my opponent had looked far deeper into the resulting middlegame.",
        "14. c4": "!!",
        "14... f5": "Black needs to chase the Knight on e4 away. If instead 14. - Nb6, White can play 15. Bxe7 with the nasty threat 16. Nf6 .",
        "15. cxd5 fxe4 16. Bc4": "Once again a strong move by White. If 16. - cxd5?? 17. Bxd5 , and the Rook on a8 are doomed.",
        "16... Bxd2+ 17. Kxd2 exf3 18. dxc6+ Kg7 19. Bd4+ Kh6 20. gxf3 Rxf3": "If we only look on the material, Black is better - but White\u00b4s Bishops rules the board, he has a dangerous pawn at c6, and is ahead in development. As we shall see, this is more than enough compensation.",
        "21. Re1 e6 22. b4 a6": "Black has been more or less forced to close in his own Bishop on c8. Now White is preparing to create double passed pawns on the Queenside of the board - eventually winning the game.",
        "23. Be5 Ra7 24. a4 Raf7 25. b5 axb5 26. axb5": "Mission accomplished! Black has no counterplay against the exposed White King, since the Bishops are covering almost everything around it. My last hope is that White will push the pawns prematurely, so I can sacrifice my Bishop for both of them. If  then I can trade off the last pawn on h2, there should be good chances to hold the game to a draw.",
        "26... Kg5 27. b6 h5 28. Bd3": "! ... Now the additonal threat to the pawn-promotion is 29. Rg1   followed by all kinds of disaster around g6.",
        "28... Kh6 29. Re3 Rf3f2+": "Trading off the Rooks would be immediate resignation, but now White tugs in his King comfortably on c3 and goes for the kill.",
        "30. Kc3 g5 31. Be4": "The end ... Next comes 32. b7, and Black will loose. What a great Bishop pair!"
