        "1. e4": "BLITZ Chess of 5 minutes each\nBaronDerKilt(aka ccmcacollister) vs chimx \nKing's Gambit \nA miniature most notable for its final move",
        "1... e5 2. f4": "Most commonly I play 2.d4 and if 2...exd4 3.Nf3 in blitz games (a move order used previously by the former U.S. Champion GM Frank J. Marshall), which may lead into a Scotch, Scotch Gambit or Goring Gambit (aka Semi-Danish, per Alekhine).\r\n ",
        "2... Nf6 3. fxe5": "This capture would not have been possible if BL had not removed his own potential to play 3... Qh4  \r\n",
        "3... Nxe4 4. Nf3": "Nf3 = Customary. Classical Knight development, as commonly played, for prophylaxis against check(s) being made from h4, in many King's Gambits.  ",
        "4... d5 5. d3": "WT also had the option to play 5.exd6, which is called an En Passant pawn capture, and would remove BL's pawn off of d5 if WT had done so. But since he did not use that option, WT now loses the chance to ever capture that pawn En Passant. [However, if black were to later play f7-f5 then WT would have an option to play e5xf6 e.p. upon that move. ]",
        "5... Bg4": "5... Nc5 was much preferrable for BL, rather than giving up the Ne4 .",
        "6. dxe4 Bxf3 7. Qxf3 Bb4+ 8. c3": "Bb4  is another error costing BL material, for if now 8...dxe4 9.Qxe4 and BL cannot save both his Bb4 and b7 pawn that are attacked by the Qe4. \r\n",
        "8... dxe4 9. Qxe4 f5 10. exf6 e.p.+": "10.exf6 e.p. with Discovered Check as well ... is a fairly rare type of move to see made, and is very strong here. ",
        "10... Kf7 11. Bc4+": "Now 11...Kf8 12.fxg7  Kxg7 13.Qg4  lets BL last a bit longer and deprives WT of his rare 0-0 checkmating move.\r\n ",
        "11... Kxf6 12. O-O#": "There should be two smiley faces painted on that move 12.O-O / One time clear back in about 1981 or 82 I won a skittles game that ended O-O-O# for the Checkmate. It has taken this long to finally add the second bookend to the set~! \nTo add some symmetry, perhaps irony; while this game from a King's Gambit Declined ends with O-O# ... the game ending in O-O-O# was won by WT from the QUEENS Gambit Declined ?!! ... Hmmmm\n  }8-) \nThanks to my opponent for playing this one all the way thru. "
