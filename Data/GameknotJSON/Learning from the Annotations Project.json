        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!\r\n\r\nThis unrated game between me and dmaestro started off as a King's Gambit Accepted.  It seems therefore that this has nothing to do with the Annotations Project but in some ways it does have everything to do with it.  You see, dmaestro lost the exchange in the middlegame but had the bishop pair.  I ended up returning a pawn for the exchange to bust up the bishop pair and eventually won.  This is how it was done ......",
        "1... e5 2. f4": "2. f4 - this move kicks off the King's Gambit.....",
        "2... exf4": "2. ...... exf4 - and I accept it.",
        "3. Bc4 Nf6": "3. ...... Nf6 - I need to get my pieces out quickly.",
        "4. Nc3 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4": "5. ..... Bb4 - Fou Lenoir moves to b4 to pave the way for castling.  If the d pawn moves then the knight on c3 will be pinned.",
        "6. Nd5 O-O 7. Nxb4 Nxb4": "7. ..... Nxb4 - Fou Lenoir goes for one of dmaestro's horsies.",
        "8. e5 d5": "8. ...... d5 - my knight on f3 is en prise.  This d5 pawn move attacks dmaestro's lsb and opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc.",
        "9. exd6 e.p. Qxd6": "9. ...... Qxd6 - a pawn trade brings Glenda out into the fresh air.  Look, she still cannot kick the habit!  There's a black pawn on f4 to be defended!  Glenda's the one!",
        "10. d4 Bg4": "10. ..... Bg4 - Fou Leblanc develops with a pin on the knight on f3.",
        "11. c3 Bxf3 12. Qxf3": "12. Qxf3?! - this loses the exchange - is dmaestro up to summat?",
        "12... Nc2+ 13. Kd1": "13. Kd1 - maybe for he doesn't wave the white flag straight after dropping the exchange.",
        "13... Nxa1 14. Bxf4 Qb6": "14. .... Qb6 - I decided to snap off the rook anyway.  Glenda has had to take evasive action because she came under fire from dmaestro's dsb.",
        "15. Kc1 Rfe8 16. Kb1 Re7 17. Kxa1": "17. Kxa1 - dmaestro's king is so hungry he could eat my horsie!",
        "17... Rae8 18. Kb1": "18. Kb1 - prophylactic action, he does not want to cop Old Matey on the back rank.",
        "18... Re7e1+ 19. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 20. Kc2": "20. Kc2 - I manage to force off dmaestro's remaining rook though.  The Wicked Witch of the West and the bishop pair could be a handful, I must be careful.",
        "20... Re8 21. g4 h6 22. h4": "22. h4 - pawn roll.",
        "22... c6 23. g5 hxg5 24. hxg5": "24. hxg5 - pawn trade.",
        "24... Nd5": "24. ....... Nd5 - I decided to give back a pawn to break up the bishop pair.  This way Glenda will have some room for manoeuvre on the white squares without being accosted by an enemy prelate.",
        "25. Bxd5 cxd5 26. Qxd5 Qg6+": "26. ........ Qg6+ - considering a move to e4 and offering a trade of queens.  By moving his king to b3 he ensures that I force the exchange of queens.",
        "27. Kb3 Qe6 28. Qxe6 fxe6": "28. ..... fxe6 - I decided to capture with the pawn rather than the rook, this way it deprives dmaestro of a passed pawn on the d column.",
        "29. Kc4": "29. Kc4 - the WK comes into the centre, I must now be careful.",
        "29... Rc8+ 30. Kd3 Kf7": "30. ...... Kf7 - and now Henry comes out towards the centre.",
        "31. Ke4 g6": "31. ..... g6 - my pawn comes in on a white square, dmaestro's bishop is a dsb, so that is one less thing to attack it.  It frees up Henry to go elsewhere.",
        "32. Ke5 Ke7": "32. ...... Ke7   Henry must prevent the WK from ingress to d6.",
        "33. Ke4 Rc6 34. a3 Rb6 35. Bc1": "31. Bc1 - a necessary retreat, I now start to put a little pressure on here.",
        "35... Kd7 36. Ke5 Ke7 37. Kf4 Rb5": "37. ....... Rb5 - a rook lift, I plan to put the rook on f5 next move to cut off the WK from my arc.",
        "38. Ke4 Rf5 39. Kd3 Kd6": "39. .... Kd6  and now Henry can move up the board.",
        "40. c4 b6 41. b4 a6 42. c5+ bxc5 43. dxc5+": "43. dxc5+ - pawn trace.",
        "43... Kd5 44. Be3 Rf1": "44. ...... Rf1 - my rook decided to attack from the back.  Dmaestro decided to wave the white flag.  Nice to have a win after that loss against the Master Mater.  I hope there will be many more such annotations to come, until then bye for now - Joanne"
