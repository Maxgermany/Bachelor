    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "I felt like this was one of the better games of my career, so I've decided to annotate it.",
        "1... d5 2. c4": "I open with the Queen's Gambit, a very popular opening in recent times.",
        "2... Bf5": "He responds with the Baltic defense, a rather rare variation of the QG declined line. Most Queen's Gambit declined lines have difficulty using their light bishops, and this solves that problem by bringing it out immediately.",
        "3. Qb3": "I bring my Queen out, looking to attack his pawn on b7, as well as defending my c4 pawn.",
        "3... b6": "He defends his pawn.",
        "4. cxd5": "I capture.",
        "4... e6 5. dxe6": "I capture again, to get rid of my doubled pawns.",
        "5... Bxe6": "Here, I am a pawn up, and have taken both of his center pawns.",
        "6. Qf3": "I look for weakness on the f file.",
        "6... Bd5 7. e4": "My other center pawn comes out. ",
        "7... Bc6 8. d5 Bb7": "Notice, he has moved his bishop five times now, losing tempo.",
        "9. Nc3": "I seek to solidify my hold on the center.",
        "9... Bb4 10. Bd2": "He pins my knight, so I bring out the bishop to block.",
        "10... a6": "A defensive move: he doesn't like his options for defending Bb5.",
        "11. a3": "I work on dislodging his Bishop.",
        "11... Bc5 12. b4": "Again...",
        "12... Bd6": "He's move his Bishops a total of eight times in twelve moves now. I've taken control of the center, making it hard for him to use his pieces efficiently in the middle game.",
        "13. Nh3": "I try to attack his f7 pawn after Ng5.",
        "13... h6": "Foiled...",
        "14. Bf4 g5 15. Be3 Nd7 16. Qd1 Be5 17. Rc1 Qf6 18. Bd2 O-O-O 19. g3 Qg6 20. Bg2": "I fianchetto my bishop to prepare to castle, and defend my center pawns. The game continues along this way for a time, with my minor tactical advances quickly rebuffed by him.",
        "20... Ndf6 21. O-O g4 22. Nf4 Bxf4 23. Bxf4 h5 24. Ne2": "Important move here- by moving my knight, I have a discovered attack with my rook on c7.",
        "24... Rd7": "He defends.",
        "25. Qd4": "Trying to pin the Knight on f6 down.",
        "25... Ne7 26. Be5 Neg8 27. Rfe1 Rh7 28. Nf4 Qh6 29. Qc3": "Another move attacking c7. ",
        "29... Ne8": "He defends it furter.",
        "30. h3": "If he captures my pawn, I recapture with my bishop and pin his rook on d7.",
        "30... f6": "He smartly decides not to.",
        "31. Bd4 Kb8 32. h4": "I make a closed pawn formation, stopping his pawns' advance.",
        "32... Rhe7": "This move signals his future attacks on my e4 pawn, a weak square now.",
        "33. Be3": "My last move here looks for a discovered attack on his Queen. I failed to realize that I am preventing my rook from defending my e4 pawn, and that will cause this game to open up very quickly.",
        "33... Qh7": "Another attack on the e4 square.",
        "34. Ne2 Nd6": "Yet again, he attacks my e4 pawn.",
        "35. Nd4": "I threated a fork on c6, but his bishop can simply capture my knight if I were to do so.",
        "35... Nxe4": "He captures my pawn, and we are even. Thankfully, I am able to use this move to take the initiative, and put a lot of pressure on him.",
        "36. Nc6+": "I check his king.",
        "36... Bxc6": "His bishop captures.",
        "37. Qxc6": "I position my queen in a very threatening location.",
        "37... Rd6 38. Qc4": "He threatens my queen, so retreat and threated his a6 pawn.",
        "38... f5": "He defends his knight, I and believe that this move cost him the game. b5 would have served him better.",
        "39. Qxa6": "I capture, and threated mate with Qb7, eventually.",
        "39... Ngf6 40. Bg5": "I try for a pin, but instead I commit a minor blunder and lose a pawn.",
        "40... Nxg5 41. hxg5 Nxd5 42. g6": "This move is vital- If he is to capture with his queen, his rook on e7 is undefended. He cannot use his knight to recapture, because then I mate with Qb7.",
        "42... Rxe1+ 43. Rxe1 Qxg6": "He avoids the blunder and comes out a pawn up.",
        "44. a4": "I again seek to move his knight, and attack the pawns defending his king.",
        "44... c6": "Defends his knight.",
        "45. Qc4 Kb7 46. Bxd5": "Another important move. He can't recapture with either his rook or pawn, because both lead to mating patterns. See if you can figure them out.",
        "46... Qf6 47. Bg2 Rd7 48. a5 b5": "His move here was another blunder. His pawn on c6 is pinned by my bishop, and so it cannot recapture.",
        "49. Qxb5+ Kc8 50. Re8+ Rd8 51. Bxc6 Qf7 52. Rxd8+ Kxd8": "I've traded rooks, and all I need to do now is trade Queens, because I have two passed pawns.",
        "53. Qb8+ Ke7 54. a6 Qe6": "This move sets up my trade.",
        "55. Qe8+ Kf6 56. Qxe6+ Kxe6 57. a7": "He can't get to the pawn in time, and so my opponent resigns. This was a particularly tactical match, with an intriguing beginning, and I hope you have enjoyed it."
