    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "This game example the importance of the center. I open d4. usually I open e4. ",
        "1... d5": "This is the logical move for black, it stop the advance of my pawn",
        "2. c4": "I played c4 here with the intention of playing the Queen's Gambit",
        "2... c6": "Black transpose in Slav Defense which is a very solid for black.",
        "3. cxd5": "I always capture the d pawn, I followed the example of Czech GM Salo Flohr",
        "3... cxd5 4. Nf3": "Nf3 to control the e5 square",
        "4... Nf6": "This move make the position symmetrical.",
        "5. g3": "I preparing to fianchetto my king bishop. I admired the great Akiba Rubinstein with his idea by this move.",
        "5... Nc6": "The logical move, black can also try 5.. g6 then Bg7 preparing for king castle",
        "6. Bg2": "Exert pressure on d5 square",
        "6... e6": "This move e6 is always takes a time for me to ponder when I'm playing black, because it would block the bishop activity in kingside, one of the possibility this bishop can supported by queen, he can remove the white bishop in g2 which is the best guard of white king. On the other hand e6 support the d pawn and open the activity of king's bishop possible to b4 square.",
        "7. O-O": "Just like all of my games I always prefer early castling for the activity of the rook.",
        "7... Be7 8. Nc3": "Add the pressure in d5 square",
        "8... O-O 9. Bg5": "I played this move for the sake of development of my rook in c1 square. I can anticipate the h6 since I decide to exchange my bishop to knight in f6",
        "9... b6": "The logical move, with the intention of black playing Ba6, Na5. Rc8 to dominate the c file.",
        "10. Rc1": "attacking the knight in c6 and as well the normal square of white queen's rook",
        "10... Bb7 11. Ne5": "All of my plan here is how to control the center, then switch the attack to black's king. American chess genius Harry Nelson Pillsburry popularized this strategy by planting the knight in e5 square. ",
        "11... Rc8": "Black challenging my rook in c1 square",
        "12. a3": "This is only a waiting move. I wait black how he visualized the current position.",
        "12... h6 13. Bxf6 Bxf6 14. f4": "supporting my knight as well to open the activity of my rook in f1",
        "14... a5 15. e3": "supporting my d pawn as well giving my queen strong activity not only in b3, a4 square but as well diagonal of e2, f3, g4 and h5. My white queen can switch both maneuver in queenside and kingside.",
        "15... Nxe5": "Black now realized the power of my knight. If for example the black bishop was on e7 and his pawn will move in f6 with the intention to eject my knight in e5, but it will create another weakness on g6 square. On my analysis Bf6 should takes the knight in e5. I think the idea why black retain his bishop because he see the weakness of my e3 square.",
        "16. dxe5": "The reason why I used 16. dxe5 rather than 16. fxe5 because I want to put my knight in d4 square to centralize my knight and to cover my weakness in e3 square",
        "16... Be7 17. Qd3": "This move restrict the black bishop move in a6, and  as well looking the weakness of black's king position",

        "18. f5": "Possibly black doesn't anticipate this move. My main idea is to have a pawn in e6 square not the obvious to isolate the pawn in d5",
        "18... exf5 19. e6": "now I achieved my goal",
        "19... Qd6 20. Qxf5 Rfe8": "Another mistake..Black's intention is to retreat his bishop to f8 then attacking twice my pawn in e6. He can try Qe5 challenging my queen in f5.",
        "21. Nxd5": "Now I really dominate the center and one pawn up so the endgame is generally favourable for white. Black active bishop in b7 was offset by his bad bishop in e7, on the other hand my knight greatly influenced the center. black should capture my knight.",
        "21... Rxc1 22. Rxc1 Bf8 23. Be4": "Now I'm threatening mate in h7",
        "23... Qxe6": "Black is hopeless, he can't avoid the mate",
        "24. Qh7+": "Black resign..He don't want to see his miserable king at the mercy of the bishop..\nSo I hope you all enjoy my simple game, How I simply execute my plan from the very beginning. Plan is very necessary for strategy. Always look the importance of center and pawn formations because both of these greatly shaped the outcome of the game..."
