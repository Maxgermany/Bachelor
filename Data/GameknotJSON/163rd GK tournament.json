Qxd1": "I thought White would be somewhat better here when I envisioned this position, but I think the correct evaluation is even.  The pawn structure is even since it will be difficult for White to hold the extra pawn.",

        "49. Kg4 Bc5 50. hxg5 hxg5 51. Kf3 Bd6 52. g4": "My opponent does not lose their nerve and make an unforced error.  My extra pawn comes to nothing.  Draw.",
