        "1. f4": "As expected.  I've played Ian several times over the years.  I still don't really know what to do against Bird's Opening...",
        "1... d5 2. e3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. Be2 Nbd7 5. d4 e6 6. Nbd2 Be7 7. c4 c6 8. c5": "Not sure that this helps White's cause as Black can attack the chain head on and White has few attacking options.",
        "8... b6 9. b4 a5": "Not entirely sure that this was right either but it worked out OK.",
        "10. bxa5 Rxa5 11. Nb3 Ra7 12. cxb6 Qxb6 13. O-O O-O 14. h3 Bxf3 15. Bxf3 Rfa8": "I liked my open acres on the Q-side and was determined to restrain the remote isolated passed pawn.",
        "16. Rf2 c5 17. dxc5 Nxc5": "At this stage, with every move Black's position seems to improve.",
        "18. Qd4 Ra7a4 19. Qd1 Nfe4 20. Bxe4 Nxe4 21. Rb2 Ba3 22. Rc2 Bc5 23. Nxc5": "but now White pushes back",
        "23... Nxc5 24. Rb1": "An interesting offer of the exchange...",
        "24... Qxb1 25. Rxc5 Qxa2 26. Rc2 Qa1": "Black's choices were limited!",
        "27. Qd3 Qf6 28. Qb5 Qd8 29. Kh2 h6 30. Bb2 Re4": "?! Dubious because White now traps this R on its one square... However, it doesn't seem fatally trapped",
        "31. Bd4 Rc8 32. Rb2 Qc7 33. Qa6": "With this move, White offered a draw.  As I had a significant time and material advantage, I rejected the offer.",
        "33... Rb8 34. Ra2 Rxd4 35. exd4 Qxf4+ 36. g3 Qxd4": "Already a pawn and the exchange up, Black has swapped the R for a B and 2 pawns, so is still material up: 3 pawns.",
        "37. Qd6 Rb2+ 38. Rxb2 Qxb2+ 39. Kh1 Qf2": "Now Black looks like winning White's last two pawns while keeping his well protected chain of pawns.",
        "40. Qd8+ Kh7 41. g4 Qg3 42. h4 Qxh4+": "??? a moment of carelessness loses the game.  I tried to retract my move momentarily but of course my opponent insisted on touch and move.  I had no excuses.  I had plenty of time left (about half an hour) whereas White had less than 10 minutes.",
        "43. Qxh4 g5 44. Qf2 Kg6 45. Qc2+ Kg7 46. Qc3+ Kg6 47. Qh8 f5": "The K couldn't move.  Moves by d or e pawns were suicidal.  ...h6 was similarly suicidal.  ...f6 lost immediately to 48. Qg8++.",
        "48. Qg8+ Kf6 49. gxf5 Kxf5 50. Qh7+ Kf4 51. Qxh6 e5 52. Qf6+ Ke4 53. Qxg5 Kd4 54. Kg1 e4": "At this point, with my opponent on about 6 minutes left, I pointed out that he needed to write up his last 20 moves in his own time and an arbiter agreed.  He did that and then didn't have to record any more...",
        "55. Kf2 Kd3 56. Qxd5+": "and I finally resigned."
