        "7... Be6 8. Nd5": "I wanted to bring my Knight to good position, d5.",
        "8... Nb4 9. Nxb4 cxb4 10. Bd2 a5": "I thought Knight trade was good choice, because Black would make bad pawn position after trade. But now I'm having pressure by b4, a6 pawns....",

        "14... Bh3 15. d5 Bxg2 16. Kxg2": "Although I lost my Bishop, I think White's position is better then Black's. Strong Pawn chain from d to f column won't be broken easily.",

        "28. Nxc8 Nxb6": "White's two Rook, a Bishop, and a Knight can reach b6 square.",
