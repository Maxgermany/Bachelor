        "1. e4 d5": "I consider this a risky opening for black. It pulls black's queen out early. White can develop his own bishops and knights to threaten the queen. The result is white develops several pieces before black deploys his own bishops and knights.",
        "2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3": "Knight comes out to threaten queen.",
        "3... Qa5 4. Nf3 Bf5 5. d3 e6 6. Bd2": "White develops another piece to threaten the black queen.",
        "6... c6": "Black gives the queen an escape square.",
        "7. a3 Nd7 8. Be2": "White gets ready to castle.",
        "8... Ngf6 9. O-O Qc7": "At move nine, all of white's minor pieces are out, and white has castled. Black still has a bishop in bed, and has not castled yet.",
        "10. Re1 O-O-O 11. Be3 Bc5 12. Bxc5 Nxc5 13. b4": "When my opponent castles on the opposite side I do, I like to push my pawns to threaten my opponent's castle.",
        "13... Nce4 14. Nxe4": "Capture black's knight so it can't threaten pieces near my king, and move my knight out from in front of a pawn so I push the pawn forward.",
        "14... Bxe4 15. Qc1": "I bet white wanted me to take the bishop with the pawn. No way am I going to expose my queen like that.",
        "15... Bg6 16. Nh4 Nd5 17. Nxg6": "This is a risky move on my part since black can counter with hxg6 and line up rook and queen on the h pawn near the king.",
        "17... hxg6 18. g3": "Advance pawn to protect the king.",
        "18... e5 19. Bf3 f5 20. Qb2 Rde8 21. Bxd5": "Bishop takes knight so black moves the pawn from out in front of the king and queen.",
        "21... cxd5 22. Rac1": "Now line up rook on same column as black's king and queen.",
        "22... Qd6 23. a4 d4 24. c4": "Didn't I say I like to advance pawns when my opponent castles on the opposite side I do?",
        "24... f4 25. c5 Qd5 26. b5 fxg3 27. fxg3": "Must take with f pawn instead of h pawn.",
        "27... Ref8 28. c6 b6 29. Qe2": "Get queen into position for its next move.",
        "29... Rh5 30. Qg4+ Rhf5 31. Re4": "Block black queen.",
        "31... Qa2 32. Rf1": "Black's rook is still pinned.",
        "32... Qxa4 33. Rxf5": "Give black some bait. If black takes with the pawn to fork my rook and queen, I'll get ready for the end game.",
        "33... gxf5": "Excellent! Black has me exactly where I want him! With black's pawn forking my rook and queen, I can threaten mate in a few moves.",
        "34. Qxg7 Qd1+": "This is just a spite check to delay the inevitable. Black knows I can move the queen to d7 and then mate on b7 after black can no longer check my own king.",
        "35. Kg2 Qd2+ 36. Kh3": "The king just steps out of the way. 1 or 2 more spite checks won't change the outcome of the game, so Black resigned at this point."
