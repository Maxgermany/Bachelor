        "6. Bg5 e6": "Klaus: We choose this Opening, because it is a modern Variation with good Chances of both Sides ! ",
        "7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3": "Myevilluck: I play Qf3 because it goes with the overall theme of white to attack the kingside. Supporting a f-pawn push eventually and allowing me to castle long. Other moves don't accomplish this accurately. I could technically probably move 8. Be2 and castle kingside, but it isn't in the spirit, and I don't like creating new plans. Moving the LSB anywhere else would be an inaccuracy because of him having moves like 8. ... Qc7 or Qb6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Klaus:If White did not play Qf3 in the 8th Move, for example he play 8.Qd2, black could play immediately b5 ! This opens black some good Counter Chances in the early stadium of the game.\n",

        "9... h6": "Klaus:  h6 is a move over that grandmasters discuss in different ways. Every pawn move of the kingsside (the side where you castled) is weakening, but i prefer this move, because White will play g5 later and i will exchange the pawns to get a more active defense over the line 6 and 7. Coincidentally the pieces of these lines should attack the opponents king side. ",
        "10. Bh4": "Myevilluck: I play 10. Bh4 because A.) I'm a bishop w**** and love keeping them around.   B.) With him playing 9. ...h6 I didn't like the idea of g5 being contested and having his DSB on f6 ready to attack me.",

Myevilluck: e5 would unprotect very important squares f5 and d5. Allowing both my knights to move to them. Nf5 Bc4 Nd5. You know all those cool moves.

        "11. Be2": "Myevilluck: Connecting my rooks and allowing me options to protect e4 later. I've had trouble in the past with my LSB getting in the way of my kingside attack, so I just move it now.",
        "11... O-O 12. Qg3": "Myevilluck: 12. Qg3 is basically a move anticipating 12. Nc5. I can get my LSB on f3 instead to protect my e4 pawn rather than tie up my queen. I also like waving at his king on the g-file. (It stops b5 for now because he has to open his bishop on its line to protect f5 as a knight could get there as said earlier, and with the Q on g3 that would be devastating.) ",
        "12... Nc5": "Elyhim even got in on the explanations: Based upon my analysis I get the sense that white's only real trump card is the centre and space. However, even though the e4 and f4-pawn are cramping my style they are over extended, especially, e4! Another reason to attack e4 immediately is to break up white's centre before he has a chance to consolidate. Therefore, I would choose 12. ...Nc5-> now white has two main replies:\n                                                                                                                        Best line 13. Bf3 e5!(attacking the d4-knight and forcing white to give up the space advantage) 14. fxe5 dxe5(black's pawn structure is better and white has an isolani e-pawn) 15.\n                                                                                                                        Now white has a to make a choice does he play 15.

Bxf6!? give black the bishop pair but now white can use the d5 strong point for his knight.\n15. Nxf5!? gives black free reign on the queenside. ",
        "13. Bf3 e5 14. fxe5": "Brigadecommander gave an alternative to this move: My idea was based on 14.Nf5 not fxe5. That is a direct attack on the black king is it not? Does Black then have to play 14....Bxf5 ?. And White then would play 15.exf5 correct?. Now blacks d-pawn is still backward, Whites LSB is released and aimed right at d5,and d6 is under attack. By 14.fxe5 white un/cramps Blacks position for him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Klaus: on 14.Nf5 Bxf5 15.exf5 Rac8 white has to play fxe5 to get Power to my e pawn and in the center. After dxe5 we have the same position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Myevilluck: I didn't play 14. Nf5 because I didn't like the way it started to look.\n\nMy line was something like: 14. Nf5 Bxf4 15. exf5 Rfc8 16. Rhe1 e4 17. Bxf6 Bxf6 18. Bxe4 Rab8\n\nIt's still very drawish, but I figured the other way gave me a shot of him being a little inaccurate. ",
