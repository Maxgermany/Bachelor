        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bd3 g6 7. Be3 Bg7 8. Qd2 Ng4": "I'm playing this move for 2 reasons. 1 being I don't want white to exchange his black-squared bishop for mine, and 2 is removing my knight, so my own black-squared bishop has a direct line of sight on white's queen side. White can't move his bishop because then his knight on d4 is no longer defended.",
        "9. Nde2 Nxe3 10. Qxe3 b5": "In case 5. ... a6 wasn't enough of an indication I was going for a full attack on that side! White has no real threat against the center right now, so there's no need castling just yet.",
        "11. O-O-O": "Despite 10. ... b5, white feels comfortable castling to the queenside! When white does queenside castling, that means both sides are going for a brutal attack; white on black's kingside and black on white's queen side. Whoever attacks faster wins the game (just the way I like it!)",
        "11... Nc6 12. f4": "The tension is building up on both sides.",
        "12... Qa5 13. Kb1": "Perhaps this move is too slow and actually moves the white king towards the location I'm attacking. But admittedly, the threat of ... b4 and Qxa2 doesn't look very inviting.",
        "13... b4 14. Nd5 Rb8": "This move serves 2 purposes: 1 is that Nc7+ no longer costs me the rook, 2 is that the rook is on the same line as the white king.",
        "15. Bc4": "Protecting the important b3 square as well as attacking the f7 pawn as soon as the knight moves.",
        "15... O-O 16. f5": "White sacrifices a pawn to clear the g line and make the f-line free for his rook",
        "16... gxf5 17. exf5 Bxf5": "But my bishop is also activated, attacking and pinning the c2 pawn.",
        "18. Qg5 b3": "White can't hit the bishop because of 19. Qxf5 bxa2+! 20. Bxa2 (20. Ka1 Bxb1 mate or 20. Kc1 a1Q+ mate) Rxb2+ 21. Kc1 (21. Ka1 Qxa2 mate) Rxa2 and the threat of 22. ... Ra1 mate will cost white a huge amount of material.",
        "19. axb3 Bxc2+": "The time is ripe for a sacrifice!",
        "20. Kxc2 Nb4+": "Because I moved my bishop away from f5, the white knight is now pinned (the queen is behind it and is not defended). White has no choice but to move his king back. Moving his king to d2 exposes his king to a check, for example Nxd5",
        "21. Kc1 Kh8": "A seemingly quiet move, but in essence a quite aggressive one! The g7 bishop is perfectly placed for an attack on the white queenside, but it is held in place by the queen. This move removes this obstacle. In addition, white is unable to defend the weak points on the queenside such as the b2 pawn (22. Rd2 Qa1 mate for example) and the white king is trapped there for the same reason mentioned previous move.",
        "22. Nec3": "Perhaps not the best move as it opens up the second file for me, but in all honesty, I can't think of any move I would like to do.",
        "22... Qa1+ 23. Kd2": "23. Nb1 Qxb2 mate",
        "23... Qxb2+ 24. Ke3 Bxc3 25. Nxb4": "Understandably not 25. Nxc3 Qxc3+ with the attack still going on while black has material advantage, but the game is of course already over; black is too far ahead and controls the important a1-h8 diagonal.",
        "25... Bxb4 26. Rhf1": "Attacking the f7 pawn, but since my king isn't on g8 anymore, the pawn is irrelevant.",
        "26... Bc5+": "No check with the queen; the queen is doing an excellent job keeping the white king away from safety.",
        "27. Kf3 Rfg8": "A dangerous attack on g2 is now in place. If white moves his queen, Qxg2 leaves only f4 for the white king",
        "28. Rd2": "This moves costs an additional rook.",
        "28... Qc3+": "29. Rd3 Qxd3+ 30. Bxd3 Rxg5 and so black forfeits."
