        "2... Bc5": "Countering symmetrically. 2... N-KB3 is the most solid response, but this move is acceptable.",
        "3. Qh5": "If properly defensed, this move should not be a threat. But Newcomb fails to properly defense it.",
        "3... g6": "An error. The correct move was 3... N-KR3, to be followed up with 4... O-O neutralizing any chance of a quick mate and leaving White's Q dangerously exposed.",
        "4. Qxe5+": "Meyer pounces on the mistake. Black's position is already crumbling.",
        "4... Ne7": "The alternatives aren't much better. There's no way to avoid losing the KR.",
