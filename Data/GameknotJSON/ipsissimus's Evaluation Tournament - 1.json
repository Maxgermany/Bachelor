        "10. hxg3": "I was expecting 10. fxg3",
        "10... Qe7": "Black has to reinforce his center, for white will control the center of the board (I do not care that much, because I'm, in  the mment playing the pirc opening  with very good results.",
        "11. Re1 O-O": "I do not see how to fiancheto the LSB and castle long : if 11... b6 12.c5 dxc5 and the d knight will be menaced, black will need the LSB to  protect it. So that castling short seems better.",

        "13. e4 e5": "preventig 14. e5 and taking some  control on the center.",
        "14. d5": "White controls the center but blocks it. White has his pawns on the same colour than his bishop, so that he is blocked.",
        "14... b6": "Now that white has plaid d5, I can advance my b pawn.",
        "15. Nh2": "To bring the knight on a more effective square",

        "21. Ba4": "proposing a trade",
        "21... Bxa4": "I wonder if this trade is really an advantage for white : with one fianchetoed bishop, it's not bad to exchange the other one. White's LSB defended the e and c pawns which are black's targets. On the other hand, the game is closed and in this situations, knights are more usefull than bishops. Anyway, I traded because I had no proper place for the LSB.\n",
        "22. Qxa4": "I was expecting 22. Nxa4. This is more agressive. In fact it proved the decisive move. Black has absolutly not control on the light squares, so that the white queen is like at home behond black's pawn.",

        "24... Nd8 25. Qd7 Nb7 26. Nf5": "Uh Uh ! It's getting dangerous and I cannot fire the queen. It's the beginning of a fine tactical sequency.",
        "26... Qd8": "Quenne exchange seems ok for black.",
        "27. Qc6": "... so must think white as well",
        "27... Rab8": "Black is cramped, having very little space behind its pawns.",
