        "1. e4": "One the always dangerous past pawn - which I had two of in this game\r\nThe power a pawn sac can give your other pieces by opening lines for bishops - in this game my opponent did not take the pawn and allowed my to get the past pawns but I still got to open the lines!!  Thanks to my friend WINECAPE who showed me this in one of his other games I will be using that trick more often!!! \r\n\r\nThis was a rematch, I was one pawn up in the 1st game when I grabbed another pawn and my opponent split my queen and King with a bishop and accordingly I resigned the game. Greed - still one of the 7 deadly sins!!\r\n\r\nI wanted to show the power a pawns in this game in two ways.\r\n\r\n",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3": "my standard opening",
        "2... Nc6 3. Bc4 h6": "to here it was a copy of our previous games",
        "4. d4": "Instead of my ussual Kc3 I wanted to open up the game and get a centralized queen early on",
        "4... exd4 5. Nxd4": "Exchange accepted",
        "5... Nxd4 6. Qxd4": "Accepted",
        "6... Qe7 7. Nc3": "trying to develop",
        "7... c6": "The only function this could have was a push on d5, which did not seem to be a problem yet",
        "8. e5": "SO I tried to stop it with empasant - not seeing my pawn was pinned by his queen..... small mistake",
        "8... d5 9. Bd3": "No option but to move it and d3 seems to be the best outpost for the time",
        "9... Be6 10. O-O": "Rex to safety",
        "10... b6 11. Bd2": "NOt worried about c5 yet",
        "11... Qc5 12. Qh4": "No exchange so early",
        "12... Be7 13. Qg3": "expected",
        "13... g5 14. Be3": "I was hoping to get his queen out of the midfield, i saw the split and also saw the way out",
        "14... d4": "expected",
        "15. Ne4": "Planned - I thought he would play Qb4 at least staying in some kind ofattacking zone",
        "15... Qa5": "So a free pawn.... munch munch",
        "16. Bxd4": "Why not, I saw the next move and had planned for it",
        "16... O-O-O 17. Bc3": "just going with it, could not have planned it better my self",
        "17... Qd5 18. Rfd1": "Getting on the open file - hoping for a check with Ba6 and stealing his queen.... Kb7 still loses the queen and so does Kd7",
        "18... Kc7": "he saw it to - this or B8 is both bad, you will see why later, but there was no other options Kd7 and Kb7 still loses the queen ",
        "19. f4": "So here comes the power of the pawns, Here I was willing to sac two pawns to open lines for my bishops, a trick I learned from my friend WINECAPE.  It is more important to keep your pieces in the game than to be a pawn up or down!!!  So sac a pawn to open the lines for your bishops",
        "19... c5 20. f5": "So I saw we both wanted to push the pawns and take a bishop, I had a plan, and I dont think my oponent saw it yet or saw the flaw in his own plan, I new I would sacrafice the knight on e4",
        "20... c4": "Still not taking the bait, Recalculating and it is looking beter now",
        "21. fxe6": "planned",
        "21... cxd3": "expected",
        "22. exf7": "planned, now he has trouble, he could not play dxc2 due to the queen hanging, he could not play Qxf7 due to the lines that I opened with the pawns - after Qxf7 e7with a discovered check wins the queen.  But why worry when he has a free knight",
        "22... Qxe4": "So the only option is grab the hanging knight - leaving me a pawn down temporarily.....",
        "23. e6+": "The long planned move with a double discovery on the king and rook.  ",
        "23... Kc6 24. Bxh8": "Getting my knight back with interest - Free stuff is always nice",
        "24... Bc5+ 25. Kh1": "Not a big problem",
        "25... Ne7": "I was thinking of Bf6, but after Qxe6 I would lose my best weapon - my two passed pawns after bxe7 qxe7 the pawn is  neutrulized and I would have to through everything at keeping the pawn, note he can still not take c2 as his rook will be lost",
        "26. Qe5": "Trying to simpligy the game",
        "26... Qxe5 27. Bxe5": "accepted",
        "27... Kd5": "SLight mistake - So i thought and had to trade up - rook for bishop",
        "28. Rxd3+": "winning another 2 pawns looked good here...., Bd4 is just a waiste of time and throughing away more material",
        "28... Kxe5 29. Re1+": "The immediate exchange would cost me a pawn or give him time to play Kg6 which would give double defense to f8 - so trying to keep them in play",
        "29... Kf6 30. Rxd8": "SOme more free stuff!!",
        "30... Nc6": "So I am up 7 - and I started to force the exchanges - worst case I would trade two pawns for knight and bishop",
        "31. f8=Q+": "Forced exchange",
        "31... Bxf8 32. Rxf8+": "WHen i looked at this in planning I thought Ke7 was his best move, followed by Rc8, Rc7+ e7",
        "32... Kg7": "This was another mistake for him, only one move to keep my mmomentum",
        "33. Rf7+": "I had planned for e7 - playing on the drama",
        "33... Kg8 34. e7": "As planned - he has two options face 2 rooks or a rook and queen in the endgame.  Kxe7 Rexe7 would lose quickly after Rxa7 and the Rook on f7 going to B7 and then B8 check mate.\r\n\r\nHe chose the second",
        "34... Kxf7 35. e8=Q+": "Here my oponent resigned"
