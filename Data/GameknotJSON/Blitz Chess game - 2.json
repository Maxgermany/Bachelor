        "4... Bh5": "He keeps the pin.",
        "5. g4 Bg6 6. h4": "I decide to chase him even further. It is clear tthat he doesn't want to go down a piece early.",
        "6... h5 7. Bh3": "I like the look of this diagonal. I also think it may be a good idea to cover my king side after I have opened it up so much.",
        "7... Nc6 8. d3 Nf6 9. g5": "I get on the front foot and try to put some pressure on.",
        "9... Nd7 10. Be3": "I get my pieces out of the way so I can castle queen side. There is obviously no chance for me to safely castle king side.",
        "10... Be7 11. Qe2 O-O 12. O-O-O": "We both castle.",
        "12... Nd4": "Why would he do that? I was curious when he played it.",

        "18... Qb6 19. Qxh5 g6": "What do you think he should have done??? And do I have a better option than to swap?",
        "20. fxg6 Bxg6 21. Qh6": "I've got him right where I want him.",
        "21... Nb4 22. h5 Bh7 23. g6": "The rooks will be swapped off now.",
        "23... fxg6 24. Rxf8+ Rxf8 25. hxg6": "Here is the killer. What should black do? And should he have taken back with the bishop?",
        "25... Rf6 26. Qxh7+ Kf8 27. Bh6+": "Time to get the bishop in on the action.",
        "27... Ke8 28. g7 Rxh6": "This is as good as black resigning.",
        "29. Qxh6 c4": "Pointless.",
        "30. g8=Q+": "After this move black resigns. I have such a material advantage even if I play poorly from here, I'll win."
