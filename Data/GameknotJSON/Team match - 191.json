Rdd2 lets black attack white's a & h pawns, though a rook and pawn for a rook is not that great a trade when black is down a knight.  But 24.... b5 is just tossing away a rook for a knight.",

This is more easily accomplished with the king, which probably requires taking out black's knight.  But I would ignore the black knight now and focus on getting the king into position.",
        "34... Ne7 35. Bd6 Nf5+": "?  PxN seems obvious.  I would have moved Nc8 here, to fork the bishop and rook.  Since the rook cannot protect the bishop, white loses the bishop for nothing.  Here black just loses the knight for nothing.",
