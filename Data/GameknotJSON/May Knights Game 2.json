Rexe3 30. fxe3 Rxe3 31. d5 Rf3": "I'm hoping to win a rook with 32...Bf4+, but White's passed d-pawn is much too fast.\n\nIt will either promote, or Black will have to give up a bishop or rook to stop it.\nI don't know how I could have played this move, to be honest.  Very careless\n\n31...Rf3 really is a ridiculous move.    You have to realize the strength of a passed pawn and keep it in mind at all times.\n\n31...Bf4 is better, but Black still seems to be in hot water.  ie) 31...Bf4 32.Rxf3 Bxf3+ 33.Kc2 and maybe 33...Bc5 34.d6 Kf7...\n\nWhite may have better options than advancing this pawn right away.   I'm not sure.\n\n",
        "32. Rxg3 Rf7 33. d6": "the game went on for a few more moves.    rooks were traded off, and Black soon resigned.\n\nPlease leave any comments and suggestions if you have some.\nYou can also email me at stevemartinish at gmail dotcom"
