        "5. Bb5+ Nd7 6. Nf5 a6 7. Ba4": "Exclam.  Keeping the bishop in order to exploit black's weak white squares.  The most common move, 7. Bxd7, trades if off for no good reason.\n",
        "7... b5 8. Bb3 Nb6": "White's advantage is also clear after 8\u2026 Nc5 9. Bd5\n",

        "16. Nc4 O-O 17. bxc3": "Possibly not urgent.  17. Rd1 might have killed me faster.\n",
        "17... Bxe4": "17\u2026 Nxe4 18. Na5 Qb6 19. Qd3 (threatening 20. Nxb7 and 21. Bd5) Nf6 20. Qg6+.  Ouch.\n",
