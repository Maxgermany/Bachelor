        "1. c4": "My standard opening with white for the last 6 years. I like the\nvariations and transpositions that mean there is never a dull game",

        "4... d5 5. cxd5": "Almost an automatic capture as the point of the english opening is to\nallow black to build a centre then destroy it. d5 cxd5 accomplishes this in\none move. There are rare exceptions - see my game with hityerclock",
        "5... Nxd5 6. Bg2": "And a rule of mine - if you start a fianchetto then complete it as soon as\npossible}",
        "6... Nb6 7. O-O Be7 8. a4 a5 9. e3 Bg4 10. h3 Be6 11. d4": "Because I dislike Qp games i usually try to avoid playing d4 for as long as possible to make\nit harder for black to transpose into one of the Qp lines. However here i had\nno sensible alternative",
        "11... exd4 12. Nxd4 Nxd4 13. exd4 c6 14. Ne4 O-O 15. Nc5": "All standard moves to here but then black started to apply the pressure\nbuilding up a small but definite advantage",
        "15... Bc8 16. Be3 Nd5 17. Rc1": "Much better was Re1 preparing to take control of the open file",
        "17... Nxe3 18. fxe3": "splitting my pawns into 3 groups of 2 and opening up the K defenses",
        "18... Bd6 19. Rf3 Qe7 20. Qc2 Re8 21. e4 Bxc5 22. dxc5 Qxe4 23. Qxe4": "Working on the\nprinciple that if your K is exposed then exchange Qs as soon as possible",
        "23... Rxe4 24. Rd1 Re8 25. Rb3 h5 26. Kf2 g6 27. Re1 Rxe1 28. Kxe1": "Already thinking about engineering a draw even though a pawn down",
