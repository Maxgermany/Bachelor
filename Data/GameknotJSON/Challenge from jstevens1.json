    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "So she starts conventionally",
        "1... c5": "Last time I played black against Jo I tried the French defence and she played the exchange variation, and should have drawn, so I go back to the Sicilian.",
        "2. f4": "She plays the so-called Grand Prix Attack",
        "2... d5": "This is the most common reply, and the best",
        "3. Nf3": "She plays this funny pawn sacrifice. I think there are better moves.",
        "3... dxe4": "So I take",
        "4. Ng5": "She has to move the attacked knight",
        "4... Nf6": "I protect the pawn on e5",
        "5. Bc4": "She attacks f7. Now I don't want to play e6 immediately, so first I decided to develop with tempo with....",
        "5... Bg4": "Hitting her queen",
        "6. Qxg4": "And she sacs the queen!",
        "6... Nxg4": "I have to take the queen of course. This is not on the World Gameknot Database, but it is on the database of Gameknot games.",
        "7. Bxf7+": "So she takes this pawn.",
        "7... Kd7": "Forced!",
        "8. Be6+": "Another check",
        "8... Kc6": "This is the best square. We have transposed into a couple of World Database Games. There are no less than 308 games on the Gameknot Database",
        "9. Bxg4": "So she gets some material back, and also threatens Nf7 winning more material",
        "9... g6": "I do this, following the World Database. Now Nf7 can be met with Qd4 and NxR(h8) with Qd4xNh8, so white doesn't normally play that.",
        "10. Nc3": "As it Kr\ufffdl Wladyslaw (2423) vs. Porkolab Sandor (2000)  2007 ",
        "10... Na6": "I decide to attack with my knight, but probably the move in Kr\ufffdl Wladyslaw (2423) vs. Porkolab Sandor (2000)  2007, Bg7 is better.",
        "11. Ncxe4": "So she gets another pawn back. Her knights are very active.",
        "11... Nb4": "So I hit c2",
        "12. Kd1": "She protects c2",
        "12... Qa5": "This move is poor. I had illusions of going after the a pawn, but then I realised that I couldn't take it, so I end up just wasting time. The established move, Kb6 is better. Established theory gives that as a draw.",
        "13. Ne6": "This is a wonderful square for the knight. I need to exchange off these knights.",
        "13... Na6": "So my knight retreats, heading for c7, exchanging the knight. We are out of the databases now.",
        "14. d3": "So she develops",
        "14... h5": "I hit her bishop",
        "15. Bf3": "She threatens discovered checks with her knight on e4. However I was more afraid of Bh3, keeping her grip on the e6 square.",
        "15... Kd7": "So I have to move my king yet again. According to the post-match computer I have a slight edge of plus 0.74 here.",
        "16. Ne4g5": "She protects that knight again.",
        "16... Qb6": "I reposition my queen, protecting the now threatened pawn on b7",
        "17. b3": "She continues her development.",
        "17... Bh6": "Preparing exchanges",
        "18. Bb2": "She hits my Rh8",
        "18... Rhg8": "Not a great square for a rook! I need to exchange both pieces and pawns and open up the board for my queen, which can't do much while there is so much material on the board.",
        "19. Re1": "She builds up on e6 again",
        "19... Bxg5": "So I start to exchange.",
        "20. Nxg5": "She takes back",
        "20... Nc7": "I now prevent her from putting a piece on e6. Post-match computer now puts me as up 0.92 and I have to agree. I can stabilise the weak squares in the centre with e6, maybe put my rooks on f8 and e8. This isn't bad for me now.",
        "21. Ke2": "I think this is poor, allowing me to exchamge knights and clear more wood from the board. The idea no doubt was to connect her rooks, which is something she needs to do, but maybe Kd2 followed by Ra1-d1 and Kc1 was better.",
        "21... Ne6": "So I hop in, with the chance of hopping again to d4 if she doesn't take. Computer puts me 1.07 up now.",
        "22. Nxe6": "She takes.",
        "22... Kxe6": "I take with the king.",
        "23. Kf1+": "She checks",
        "23... Kd7": "My king goes back. Now here is a great chance for her to re-establish her control of the white squares in the centre. I think she should play Bd5 followed by Be6 check and I am struggling to develop everything to good squares again. Luckily for me she didn't and she played.....",
        "24. Rad1": "This, not a bad developing move, but, in my view, not the best. What do you think dear reader?",
        "24... Rgf8": "So I hit f4",
        "25. g3": "She protects.",
        "25... g5": "I hit it again. I am opening up the position, but she has chances in the more open position too.",
        "26. Bxh5": "She takes.",
        "26... gxf4": "I take",
        "27. Bg4+": "She throws in a check",
        "27... Kd8": "I retreat, blocking the connection of my rooks, but I can't afford to either advance to d6 nor to let the pawn on e7 drop. Ke8, walking into a pin along the e file doesn't look clever either. Computer puts me as 1.85 ahead now.",
        "28. Re6": "She hits my queen, but computer prefers 28. Kg2 Qg6 29. Bf3 fxg3 30. hxg3 Qa6 31. Rd2 Rc8 32. a3 Qh6 33. Rde2 Rc7 34. Bd5 with black 1.79 ahead. \r\n",
        "28... Qa5": "Computer thinks I am 3.43 ahead.",
        "29. a4": "She protects her pawn on a2",
        "29... fxg3+": "So I take with check",
        "30. Kg2": "King moves.",
        "30... Rf2+": "I throw in a check.  Computer gives this as a mistake and gives gxh2 31. Kxh2 b5 32. Re4 bxa4 33. Rxa4 Qb6 34. Kg3 Qd6+ 35. Kg2 Qd5+ 36. Re4 Qf7 37. Kh1 Qf2 38. Rde1 Qxc2, with black 3.56 ahead. It thinks black is 0.87 ahead now.  \r\n",
        "31. Kxg3": "So white takes",
        "31... Rxc2": "And I take. Although this looks logical to me, the computer thinks this is a mistake and favours \u2026 Rf7 32. h4 Qb4 33. Re4 Qb6 34. Re6 Qa5 35. h5 Qb4 36. Be5 Rf8 37. d4 c4 38. bxc4 Qxc4 with black 1.05 ahead. After this blunder computer thinks white is 2.34 ahead and gives the continuation Rxc2 32. Be5 Qb4 33. Rg6 Qxb3 34. Be6 Qxa4 35. Rg8+ Qe8 36. Rxe8+ Kxe8 37. Bd5 Rd8 38. Bxb7 Kd7 39. h4 Rf8 40. Bf4\r\n",
        "32. Bg7": "But luckily for me, she didn't play that! Computer gives this as level now.",
        "32... Qb4": "So I go after her pawns.",
        "33. Rde1": "Computer gives this as a massive mistake and gives 33. h3 Qxb3 34. Rf1 Rc4 35. Rf8+ Kd7 36. Re4+ Kd6 37. Re6+ Kd7 as the best way to maintain the equality.\r\n",
        "33... Rg2+": "It is all over now. After she takes the rook, she loses both her bishops and is queen for rook down. Funny how quickly a game can go from being level to being hopeless, with moves which look sensible and are not apparent blunders, but subtle mistakes. Bad luck Jo, but you gave me quite a fight!
