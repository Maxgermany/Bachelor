    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "this game resulted from my first game against this player, which I won only after some fierce battling from either sides; so I decided to give this bloke another unrated (!!!) shot at me... which I got to regret very soon...",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6": "full blooded Italian Giuoco Piano; now d3, would introduce us to Pianissimo, while b4 leads to the Bird variation... I usually prefer the Modern Variation, with d4...",
        "5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Bb4+ 7. Bd2 Bxd2+ 8. Nbxd2 d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Qb3": "totally by the book, so far; black has some tough choices to make here...",
        "10... Nce7": "probably the safest way to go... after Be6, Qxb7, things might get out of hand soon...",
        "11. O-O O-O 12. Ne5 c6 13. Rfe1": "f4 looks tempting, but is no good after f6, Nef3, Kh8!",
        "13... Qb6 14. Qxb6 axb6 15. Ndf3 h6 16. Re2 Be6 17. a3 Rfd8": "the next best move; better was b5... but we will see this happening more often, later on...",
        "18. Kf1 Nf5": "same here...",
        "19. Rae1 g5": "Re8 was to be preferred... and why not b5?",
        "20. Bb3": "to rule out b5...",
        "20... Kg7 21. g4 Nd6 22. h4": "it is time for action... white is breaking up formation...",
        "22... Nf4": "greed before the fall... better keep Nf4 as a threat, and play Kf6, Rd2, b5...",
        "23. Bxe6": "the break, that white needed... blacks' white bishop is too strong...",
        "23... Nxe2": "there is no doubt here, that first fxe6, Re3, Kf6!, is much safer; after fxe6, hxg5, hxg5, Nxg5, Rh8!, black holds...",
        "24. hxg5": "way stronger than Rxe2, fxe6, hxg5, Rf8, gxh6+, Kxh6...",
        "24... fxe6": "water under the bridge; better Nf4, gxh6+, Kxh6, Nxf7+, Nxf7, Bxf7, Rd7... at this time, I warned my opponent for my soon free g-pawn...",
        "25. gxh6+ Kxh6 26. Kxe2": "of course way stronger than Rxe2...",
        "26... Rdh8": "plausible, but not the best of play... after Kg7, Ke3, Nb5, most troubles are over...",
        "27. Ke3 Kg7": "now, it will cost an expensive tempo...",
        "28. Ng5 Rh6": "probably better Kf6, to keep the rook unoccupied...",
        "29. f4 Ra4": "locking in the other rook, better first Nb5 to build up a threat...",
        "30. Kd3": "of course, Nb5 is met with Nc4... threatening e6 and b6...",
        "30... Kf8": "it is always hard, to admit you made a useless move and spoiled a tempo; best is of course back to Ra8, since Nb5 leads to nothing after Nc4... Rh2, Nxe6+ leads to trouble; but what follows, is even worse...",
        "31. Nef3": "simple, yet very effective; blacks' position is breaking up on e6, while covering d4 in the process... sadly enough, after this black went in full Guru Mode: 3 days thinking, 1 free weekend day, postponed for 4 days, another free weekend day, and thought some more... where people get the time for this, boggles me...",
        "31... b5": "at last the prodigal b5... after b4, black has a chance to make the a-rook count again... but it is all too late...",
        "32. Nxe6+": "after Kg8, f5, after Kf7, Nc5...",
        "32... Kg8 33. f5": "gradually taking up more free space; whites' connected free pawns are starting to roll, and both black rooks are displaced... meanwhile on the white board, the King is ready to travel to f4, and maybe g5...",
        "33... b4 34. Nc5 Ra7 35. axb4": "finally, blacks rooks are able to work together...",
        "35... Rh3": "best was Ra2, Re2 (b3 is no good here), Rh3... now, white is gaining an extra tempo to reach f4...",
        "36. Ke3": "Nc4+, Kf4...",
        "36... Ra2 37. Kf4 Rxb2 38. Re6 Nb5": "by now, blacks' position is already very suspect; suddenly, with the help of sacrificing some useless pawns, white has set the board on fire... odd as it may seem, best here is Rxf3+, Kxf3, Nb5 to create some real counter play... Nc4, Rg6+, Kh8, Ne4!, Rxf3+, Kxf3, Nd2+, Nxd2, Rxd2, Rd6 will get out of hand much faster with Kf3-f4-g5...",
        "39. Ne5 Nxd4": "by now Nc7, Rg6+, Kf8 and regroup, was much to prefer... black chooses to keep picking off useless pawns that ran their course a long time ago...",
        "40. Re8+ Kg7": "this leads straight to mate... tougher would have been Kh7, Ne4, Rh6, and try and haul in the other rook...",
        "41. f6+ Kh7": "Kh6 means sudden death after Rh8 and mate... Kxf6, Ne4+/Ncd7+, Kg7, Re7+, leads to similar variations...",
        "42. Re7+ Kg8": "Kh6/Kh8 mates quicker...",
        "43. Rg7+": "Kh8, Ng6 mate... Kf8, Ncd7+, Ke8, Rg8 mate... so black resigned..."
