        "1. Nc3": "Black's offense started after a wrong pawn structure decision made by white that exposed his king, after some exchange of blows white blundered allowing an exchange sacrifice and the consequent simplification of the resulting position assured black an easily won endgame...",
        "1... d5 2. d4 Nf6 3. g3 Bf5 4. Bg2 e6 5. Nf3 h6 6. O-O Be7 7. Kh1 O-O 8. Nh4 Bh7 9. f4": "we have a very strange closed position, I might need to open it a little bit to get some more action on... my bishops for now seams inoffensive, only c2 is threatened I might have to reposition the on the other wing, or an attack on queen's wing might just do it!",
        "9... c5": "adding tension to the position, in a reply to whites space on the kings wing I start my maneuver on the queen's wing",
        "10. e3": "what a lousy structure white has... can I get any thing from it? He has very weak light squares around his king, if I'm able to exchange light squared bishops I'll be fine with a slight advantage",
        "10... cxd4 11. exd4": "with white's knight on c3 the d4 pawn is left slightly unprotected...",
        "11... Nc6": "aimed at it",
        "12. f5": "? further opening the position with his king already exposed is not the best idea, although white needed something to contrapose my threat",
        "12... Qb6": "ignoring it I add another attacker on the queen's wing, also b2 now is under my long range scope, if white exchanges fxe6 I'll get a bonus open f column...",
        "13. fxe6 fxe6": "and now we will have an open column to explore",
        "14. Nf3": "the knight on h4 is now doing nothing so he is back in the center protecting the d pawn",
        "14... Nb4": "now c2 my pieces are threatening to do some damage, so white is forced to defend",
        "15. Ne1": "defends c2, but blocks the queen...",
        "15... Ne4": "my knight start an attack on the square f2",
        "16. Rxf8+": "? exchanging leaves me with a dominance over the open column, Rf2 might be in order soon",
        "16... Rxf8": "the f column is mine",
        "17. Nxe4": "forced",
        "17... Bxe4": "I prefer to offer the exchange of bishops also to weaken the f1 square also",
        "18. Bxe4 dxe4": "white is doing the work for me exchanging like a mad man, and now I have a passed pawn and d5 to place my knight",
        "19. Bf4": "blocks the f column but gives another aim to my next move",
        "19... Nd5 20. Ng2 Qxb2": "now if Rb1 I have Rxa2 wining a pawn or even Qc3 to control e3 and e1",
        "21. c4 Nxf4": "forced but not necessarily bad, I guess white is trying to reduce the force of my attack by exchanging pieces, but his exposed king may be his \"perdition\" ",
        "22. Nxf4 e3": "now pushing my pawn I might even consider sacrificing a quality to try and force the promotion...",
        "23. Rb1 Qxa2": "getting me another pawn and eyeing c4",
        "24. Rxb7": "?? allows me a tactical blow that forces the promotion",
        "24... Rxf4": "I can sacrifice a quality to force promotion, now 25.gxf4 e2 threatens the queen, 26.Qe1 to block the pawn 26...Bh4 to control the promotion square and white is forced to capture h4 or allow immediate promotion freeing the promotion square and promotion follows soon",
        "25. gxf4 e2": "threatening exd1++",
        "26. Rb8+": "just a delay check",
        "26... Kf7 27. Qe1": "now Qe1 is forced",
        "27... Bh4": "and the intended bishop sacrifice to force the promotion",
        "28. Rb7+": "again a delaying move by white, that changes nothing the e pawn is soon to promote",
        "28... Kg8": "headed to the safety of h7, and here is the conditional I've created 29. Rb8+ Kh7 30. Qb1+ Qxb1+ 31. Rxb1 e1=R+ (ironically I don't even need a queen) 32. Rxe1 Bxe1 converting in to an easily won endgame\n\n",
        "29. Rb8+ Kh7 30. Qb1+ Qxb1+ 31. Rxb1 e1=R+": "and now Rxe1 forced Bxe1 with the idea Bb4 next to stop the central c4 and d4 pawns",
        "32. Rxe1 Bxe1": "all this was in the conditional move I've entered, now my main idea is to get my bishop to b4 to hold white's c and d pawns if white plays c5, but white might even try to sacrifice his f pawn to get my e pawn out of the way either way Bb4 will hold white's pawns until I'm able to get my king to support the bishop:\n\nsome possible sequences are:\na) c5 Bb4 c6 Bd6 and holds\nb) c5 Bb4 f5 exf5 c6 Bd6 holds\nc) c5 bb4 f5 exf5 d5 Bxc5 and holds\nthe same as above but with f5 exf5 played first\nd) f5 exf5 d5 Bb4 holds\ne) f5 exf5 c5 Bb4 holds because white cant play c6, same as in a) nor d5 same as in c)\n\nas I commented before an easy endgame for black"
