    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "I had a bad start just missing the best replies in the opening and giving white the initiative and an attack against y weak d6 pawn, he eventually won that pawn, but not without allowing some structure weakness... I was able to exchange in to a drawish rooks endgame setting up a defense with the rooks on the 5th and 8th and keeping the king able to get in front of white's passed pawn... finally without possibility of progress, a draw was agreed",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bb5+": "Sicilian (B51), Canal-Sokolsky (Nimzovich-Rossolimo, Moscow) attack",
        "3... Nc6 4. O-O Bd7 5. Re1 Nf6 6. c3 a6": "the idea is to play e5 and enter a Ruy Lopez, kind of set-up, but until now it's all theory",
        "7. Bf1": "!? surprised me I expected Ba4 this gives black at least an equal game",
        "7... e5": "now I have to be careful about a white outpost on d5 and the d6 pawn",
        "8. d4 cxd4 9. cxd4 Bg4 10. d5": "blocking the centre, so I'll must attack on the king's wing while white should proceed attacking my queen side",
        "10... Nd4 11. Be3 Nxf3+": "needed as I didn't like the prospect of Bxd4",
        "12. gxf3 Bc8": "now white has a weakness on his castle pawn structure, and I must chose between three options Bh5 keeping the pin on the f pawn, Bd7 to prepare b5 and defend the queen side away from the promotion squares or Bc8 leaving the bishop less exposed and allowing some more space in front of my king, I chose the last one with the idea of playing Nd7 latter on",
        "13. Nd2 Be7": "I need to castle and get my rook to e8",
        "14. Nc4 Nd7": "preventing Nb6",
        "15. Qc2": "N in the game Balogh Csaba (HUN) - Grivas Efstratios (GRE), Budapest (Hungary), 2001 white played f4, eventually the game went on until a draw was reached a couple of moves latter",
        "15... O-O": "finally I get to castle, next will follow Re8 and Bf8",
        "16. Rac1 Re8": "next I'll move bishop to f8 a thematic manoeuvre for this kind of structures, with the idea of a latter g6 and eventually exchange my bad dark squared bishop",
        "17. a4": "white is quite aggressive on the queens wing, he probably intends to prevent b5 and support a future outpost on b6",
        "17... Bf8": "I follow up with my plan",
        "18. a5": "preparing an outpost on b6, I must reply on the king's wing",
        "18... Qh4 19. Bg2 Rb8": "protecting b7 and avoiding issues with Nb6, white now has an drawing sequence with Ba7 Ra8 Be3 Rb8 Ba7...",
        "20. Qb3 Nc5 21. Qc3 Nd7": "again a threat of repetition, now from me",
        "22. Qa3 Nf6": "with the previous play on the king's wing, I achieved nothing, so it's time to change the side of my action, the idea is to play Nh5-f4 at some point in the future",
        "23. Nxd6": "as I commented on move 7 I should be careful about the d6 pawn weakness, and as if to prove my point here is white taking it...",
        "23... Bh3": "forcing the exchange of bishops",
        "24. Bxh3 Qxh3 25. Bc5 Nh5": "and now the planed Nh5 to get to f4",
        "26. f4": "white needed to get some more defenders to the king's wing, and needed to keep the bishop defending d6",
        "26... Nxf4": "Now I expect Qxh3, and white trying to improve his passed pawn, while black striving for equality",
        "27. Qxh3 Nxh3+ 28. Kf1 Red8": "for now I'll postpone the Nf4, but it is in order anytime now",
        "29. Nf5": "now I must choose between g6 to provide an escape square for my king with tempo and Bxc5 exchanging bishops, also b5 deserves my attention, for Nf4 with the idea of sacrificing the knight for three pawns with Nxd5 exd5 Rxd5 I'm not sure I have enough tempi... ",
        "29... Bxc5": "forced",
        "30. Rxc5 g6": "to create an escape square for my king, preventing back rank surprises",
        "31. Ne3 Nf4": "now I start to think about playing b5 and if axb6 ep, Rxb6",
        "32. Rc7": "? white needed this move, but I question the opportunity of it now, he needed some preparation, now I'll push the f pawn to undermine the supporting e4 pawn and force the exchange of white's knight plus his dangerous passed d pawn, we'll probably end up against a passed f pawn but a less dangerous one, as my king will be near it to prevent promotion... ",
        "32... f5": "... here it is, and a draw is closer",
        "33. exf5 Nxd5 34. Nxd5 Rxd5": "worked as planed... ",
        "35. f6": "again white is moving accordingly to my plan",
        "35... Rxa5": "now I need to exchange all distant pawns and set up a defense against mate threats in the 8 th and 5th rank",
        "36. Rg7+ Kh8": "Rf8?",
        "37. Rc1 e4": "opening up the 5th rank for my rook, and preventing any f2 push",
        "38. Rxb7": "! as i can't capture due to immediate mate",
        "38... Rb5": "if Rxb5 axb5, again not Rxb5?? due to mate in one",
        "39. Rf7": "?! allows me to play a5 were it will be defended by the 5th rank rook",
        "39... a5": "...protecting my a pawn weakness, from now on I don't have to worry about b2 as my defended a5 pawn will take care of it, I expect Rcc7, but then I have Rh5 were it eyes h2 and defends both h7 and a5",
        "40. Rcc7 Rh5": "the other weakness I needed to address, the rook defends h7 and the mate threat Rxh7+ Kg8 Rg7+ Kf8 Rh8++, also pust some presure over h2, so I expect Kg1, or Kg2, the rook is overcharged but white doesn't have any way of profiting from it, we've reached a stand on situation, it's a draw now I'm sure...",
        "41. Rcb7 Rc8": "not Rxb7?? as Rf8 is mate",
        "42. Ke2 Kg8": "threatens Rc2+ and the exchange of rooks, Kd1 Rxb2 Rxb2 Kxf7 wining a pawn a creating a distant passed one... Rxh2 makes no sense since I can't push the h pawn with both white rooks on the 7th rank...",
        "43. Rfg7+ Kh8": "to keep two defenders on the h pawn",
        "44. Ke3": "? allows me to move my rook to f8 were it eyes f6, now it's white that has to take care of my mounting threats... against h2 and now f6, latter on against f2 and a2",
        "44... Rf8 45. Rgc7": "and white proposed a draw which I accepted, as Rxf6 isn't possible and white can't progress..."
