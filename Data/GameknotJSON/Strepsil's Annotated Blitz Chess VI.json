        "17... Bb7": "I see something. A could pin the pawn to his queen and persuade his pawn to take one of my pieces, which would give me the queen, but how do i get to this position? I see my pawn on f6: My bait, And my pawn on c6, my barricade. Now I'm thinking further. The rook and bishop connect and collide on the g2 square.",
        "18. Rfd1": "He uses his rook to protect the pawn.",
        "18... c5": "I go for it, trying out my plan. ^^\n                                          00\n                                           V\n                                           -",
