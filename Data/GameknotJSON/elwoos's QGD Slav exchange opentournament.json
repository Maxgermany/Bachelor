        "1... d5 2. c4 c6 3. cxd5 cxd5": "Tournament starting position",
        "4. Nf3": "I'm still not sure about this move at this point it seems passive to me, though of course it is a step towards castling",
        "4... Nf6 5. Nc3 Bf5 6. Qb3": "As black has moves his lsb I can make some early threats, I am hoping to get my lsb on the a4-e8 diagonal as soon as I can",
        "6... b6": "I'm not sure this is the best move for black I think I would probably defend the pawn with my queen, perhaps Qd7",
        "7. Bg5": "black is starting to look a little cramped",
        "7... e6": "While this opens a nice line for the dsb it also prevent the lsb from defending the king",
        "8. e4": "Now I can finally get my lsb to b5",
        "8... dxe4 9. Bb5+ Ke7": "I'm not sure I understand this move, the black dsb is looking very sorry for itself now, I was expecting something like Nb8-d7",
        "10. Ne5": "My knight is going to be tough to shift from there while the black f6 knight stays where it is though of course it can't currently move",
        "10... Qd6": "Looking to free some space for the king, I have the white squares around it dominated, I just need to work out how to claim the black ones too",
        "11. Bf4": "Threatens to gain the queen with something like Nc6+",
        "11... Qxd4 12. Rd1": "Now Nc6 is even more tempting if it wasn't for the black knight on b8, I considered Bc6 which would gain material but in the end I wanted to trap the black king in, the black queens options are limited now",
        "12... Qc5 13. Na4": "And now black is doomed, its hard to see how he can save his queen or the game",
        "13... Qc8 14. Qb4+ Qc5": "forced",
        "15. Nxc5 bxc5 16. Qxc5#": "Thanks for reading please feel free to comment"
