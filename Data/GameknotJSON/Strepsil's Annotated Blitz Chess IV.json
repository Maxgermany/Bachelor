        "3. Bg2": "I get my bishop out of the way for castling.",
        "3... Nf6": "He opens up his other knight - what I would usually do.",
        "4. Nf3": "I decided to try to persuade him to take my pawn then threaten his knight repeatedly, but\u2026",
        "4... a5": "\u2026He doesn't take my pawn, but instead pushes up his pawn on the wing up two squares, something that I think is pointless.",

        "28. Qa7+": "I check him with my queen, ignoring the queen swap.",
        "28... Kc8": "YAY!!! Checkmate in one move.",
        "29. Ba6#": "I checkmate him with my bishop, my queen blocking his escape routes. :)\nBelieve it or not, I didn't actually checkmate him here in the blitz game. I actually played: Bc4! :D But then I won his rook and he reigned. Apart from not checkmating him in the blitz game, that was a great game!\n"
