        "7. Nxc6 dxc6 8. Bc4 b5 9. Be2": "The seemingly more logical 9.Bb3 fails to 9...Bg4 10.Qe1 [or 10.Ne2 Rxe4 winning the pinned Knight] 10...b4, and if 11.Na4 Rxe4 traps the White Queen.",
        "9... Nxe4 10. Nxe4 Rxe4 11. Bf3 Re6 12. c3": "If White were able to follow up with 13.d4, this would be a good move, but he can't. He should reconcile himself to 12.d3.",
        "12... Qd3 13. b4 Bb6 14. a4 bxa4 15. Qxa4 Bd7 16. Ra2 Rae8": "Threatens mate with 17...Qxf1+. White's reply defends against this sacrifice but allows another, which Paulsen can hardly be blamed for missing. Relatively best was 17.Qd1",
        "17. Qa6 Qxf3 18. gxf3": "Morphy took 12 minutes to decide on 17...Qxf3, an unusually long time for him. Paulsen, a notoriously slow player, thought for over an hour before capturing the queen.",
        "18... Rg6+ 19. Kh1 Bh3 20. Rd1": "Black threatened 20...Bg2+ 21.Kg1 Bxf3++, and 20.Rg1 fails to 20...Rxg1+ 21.Kxg1 Re1+. The key line, which Paulsen probably missed at move 17, is 20.Qd3 [hoping to return the queen with 20...Qxg6] 20...f5! and White is helpless.",
        "20... Bg2+ 21. Kg1 Bxf3+ 22. Kf1 Bg2+ 23. Kg1 Bh3+ 24. Kh1 Bxf2 25. Qf1 Bxf1 26. Rxf1 Re2 27. Ra1 Rh6 28. d4 Be3": "White resigns."
