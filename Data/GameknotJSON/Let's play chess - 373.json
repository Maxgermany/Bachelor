        "8. Bxb4 Nxb4 9. Bxf7+": "nice combination ......",
        "9... Kxf7 10. Qb3+ d5 11. Qxb4 Re8": "black joins his Rook to the game and in the same time black wishes to make an illusion of castling  with the idea of Kg8 . an illusion castling it means that , even black (on this case) cant castle any more on both side , with maneuvering of the rook to e8 and Kg8 it make like black castled on the king side .",
        "12. O-O Kg8 13. Nc3": "white keeps on his development ",
        "13... c6 14. Rfe1 Qe7": "black offering queen exchange ,butt some how i decided to decline this offer because of the blacks queen uncomfortable position and another problem for black after 14...Qe7?! is that , it puts its own piece under a pine .",
        "15. Qa4 Bf5 16. Ne5": "black was anyway going to break the pine by retreating his queen to c7 or any place , so my idea was to close blacks E file and on the same time activet my knight to better position . if you notice the defrense between whites Ne5 and blacks Ne4 is that the black knight can easly destroy or devorse it by f3 , however , the white knight can stay on e5 as long as it wants and , that makes the white knight on e5 very effective piece .",
        "16... Qh4": "bad move , this move doesnt do any thing . its very easy to avoid this threat .",
        "17. Nxe4 Bxe4 18. Re2 Qg5": "blunder, the black queen puts it self to very dangerous spot which you will see next , a nice combination finishes the game for black .",
        "19. Rxe4": "the idea of the quality scarifies its to open the diagonal a2-g8 for the white queen which unleash hell on the black king . and unfortunately for black he falls into this deadly trap . actually after 18....Qg5??.19.Rxe4!! black in lost position .",
        "19... dxe4 20. Qb3+": "black sees the threat and he can do nothing about it , there for , black resigns . either he loses his queen after 20...Kh8.21.Nf7+and a fork on the queen on g5 and the king on h8 , or Black's king will be checkmate after 20...Kf8.21.Qf7#. thank you and i hope you enjoy the game ."
