        "3... Bc5 4. Bc4": "Here I could have played 4.Nxe5 Nxe5 5.e4 ",
        "4... h6 5. O-O Nge7 6. d3 a6 7. a3": "I played 7.a3 to lead up to 8.d4 but I don't like the way 8.d4 separates the pawns. I think 7.Be3 would have been better.",
        "7... O-O 8. b4 Ba7 9. Nd5": "I have a big space advantage right now, but can I hold it? ",
        "9... d6 10. c3": "am I entombing my pieces or supporting them?",
        "10... Kh8 11. Be3 f5 12. Bxa7": "bad move! black bishop sitting on a7 limited where his N could move to. Now black can move his N without wasting a move and open up c6 so I can be driven back.",
        "12... Nxa7 13. Ng5": "brain freeze",
        "13... Nxd5 14. Bxd5": "I think 14.Nf7+ Rxf7 15.Bxd5 would have been better",
        "14... Qxg5": "again I helped him develop",
        "15. Qf3": "I wonder if 15.exf5 Rxf5 16. f3 would have been better?",
        "15... f4 16. g3": "I don't like this move but I'm not sure what else would have been better. Maybe Rfd1?",
        "16... Bh3 17. Bxb7": "I should have played Rfd1 here",
        "17... fxg3 18. Qxg3 Qxg3+ 19. hxg3 Rab8 20. Bxa6 Bxf1 21. Rxf1 Rf3 22. a4": "I should have played Kg2 or d4",
        "22... g5 23. g4": "and again Kg2",
        "23... Rbf8 24. Kg2 h5 25. Rh1": "if I had played d4 I would have the help of my bishop right now. I don't know what the best move is here, definitly not Rh1 but maybe gxh5",
        "25... Rf3xf2+ 26. Kg1 h4 27. d4 Nc6 28. d5": "????",

        "35... cxb6 36. axb6 Rdb1 37. Bg2": "I didn't think throught this one",
