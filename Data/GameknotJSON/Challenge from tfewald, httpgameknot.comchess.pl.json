        "4. e5 Ne7": "GM Simon Williams recommends this move in his videos, \"Killer French\". It's less popular than c5, though. Looking through the game now, though, that I never even moved my c-pawn; hardly a normal French.\n",
        "5. a3 Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 O-O": "Castling is generally good, but I don't think I was ready for it. I needed to develop more pieces first, as well as play get the C pawn out.\n",
        "7. Bd3 f5": "Serious blunder, blithely carrying out my plans without watching what my opponent is doing. Ng6 would have been better defensively.\n",
        "8. exf6 e.p. Rxf6 9. Qh5 g6": "Ng6 might have been better, but it allowed Bg5! pinning the R to the Q. Looks to me like it's already over. I don't have a good defense. My entire queen side hasn't budged except the d pawn.\n",
        "10. Qg5 Qf8": "The only move, but my Q is seriously overworked, protecting the N, R, and h6. All momentum is with my opponent.\n",
        "11. h4 Nbc6": "Desperately trying to bring in some help. Nd7 leaves the N no where to go.\n",
        "12. h5 Nd8 13. hxg6 Nxg6 14. Qh5 Qg7": "Very bad. Qf7 was better. Ended up there anyway, but gave the opponent an extra tempo this way.\n",
