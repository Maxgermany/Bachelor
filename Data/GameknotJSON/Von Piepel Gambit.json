        "1. d4 d5 2. e4": "I've been really starting to like gambits lately; mainly unsound ones. I was actually considering the true blackmar gambit (1.d4 d5 2.e4 dxe4 3.f3) although it's dubious because of 3...e5 I still think it has a psychological advantage because of its seldom use in chess.",
        "2... dxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5": "I chose not to go into the blackmar-diemer gambit because it's highly theoretical. I want to play a gambit my opponent hasn't seen. This move leads to the Von Popiel Gambit. I think this gambit variation is better than the Blackmar diemer because instead of giving up on getting the pawn back white fights back for it while also developing a piece which is the main goal of this opening.",
        "4... Nc6": "This move immediately gives white the advantage. He can gain the pawn back with extra tempo and cramp black's position. Better is 4...Bf5 then %.Qe2 threatening ...Qb5= forking the king and queen. You get a englund gambit reversed type position.",
        "5. d5 Ne5 6. Bxf6": "I knew I messed up on this move. Better was Qd4 and I get a stronger Nc3 nimzowitsch defense Qd4 attack.\n(1.e4 Nc6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.d5 Ne5 Qd4)\nI also would have won the pawn too.",
        "6... gxf6": "I did not understand this capture. Exf6 was so much better. this just ruins blacks structure and doesn't really develop black's bishop",
        "7. Nxe4 Bf5 8. Ng3 Bg6": "This is a huge blunder because i can win a piece",
        "9. f4 Nd7 10. f5": "My opponent resigned"
