        "1. e4": "I usually play d4 first move but recently i saw a beautiful game with a variation in king's gambit that i never saw before: 3.Bc4 instead of Nf3.\nI thought that in king's gambit not to play 3.Nf3 is madness.I already won 2 or 3 games with this variation and lost only one.I like it very much because it leads to open game with great attacking potential from both sides.\nSo i start with e4 and hope for e5\n",
        "1... e5": "e5 it is",
        "2. f4 exf4": "ok, the gambit is accepted\n",
        "3. Bc4": "As I said, I thought that anything else than Nf3 is suicide but apparently it isn't :)",
        "3... Bc5": "In the game that made me fall in love with this variation, 3rd move from black is Qh4  and Bc5 is 4th move\ncontinued with 5. d4 ",
        "4. Bxf7+ Kxf7 5. Qh5+ g6 6. Qd5+": "I was hoping that he'll move the king to f8 maybe and then i can take the bishop with tempo, i had nothing to lose with this move, just postponing on taking the bishop",
        "6... Kg7 7. Qxc5 d6 8. Qc4": "f7 square is very important for my attack because i'll try to castle and open up f file for my rook ",
        "8... Nf6 9. Nf3 h6 10. d4 g5": "protecting f-pawn, it took him 2 moves to do that",
        "11. Nc3": "don't know why i made that move... 0-0 was better",
        "11... Re8": "first sign of aggression from him",
        "12. e5 Bf5": "can't take the knight because the pawn is pinned",
        "13. O-O Ne4 14. Nh4": "my first try to open up the f file\nif he takes then 15. Rxf4 an from my analysis the worst case scenario for me is winning a pawn which isn't so bad :)\n",
        "14... Bh7": "he decides not to take it and moves the bishop to safety\nmaybe Be6 is better here, attacking my queen",
        "15. Bxf4": "ok, time for the second try",
        "15... Nxc3": "not  accepting the sacrifice again, but the file is open now",
        "16. Bxg5 hxg5": "he finally accepts the sacrifice and it allows me a nice cobination for the end",
        "17. Rf7+ Kh8": "this or Kh6 is pretty much the same\nhe can hold it a little longer by playing Kg8 but the result is the same-->checkmate\n",
        "18. Rxh7+ Kxh7": "forced",
        "19. Qf7+": "and he resigns\nif Kh8 -> Ng6#\nif Kh6 -> Qg6#\n\nfor the next few games king's gambit is my openning :)\n"
