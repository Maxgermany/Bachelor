    "moves": {
        "1. f4": "This game consisted of a relentless attack force of minor pieces and rooks.  I had lots of fun playing this game and Joanne did well to solve many of the puzzle; but makes the final mistake on move 22. Qxa2??\n",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+": "Freddy's adaptation to the original annotation project with g7 instead of c5.  Black seems to gain a slight edge in possible development; making whites win much more challenging.  White's main goal will be to slow blacks development and generate an attack upon the black king.\n",
        "7... Nxg4 8. Be6+ Kc6": "Choice of Ke8 or Kc6 here black choices Kc6.\n",
        "9. Bxg4 e5": "This line tries to take advantage of whites seemingly weak knight and allows alternate routes for the dsb.\n",
        "10. Nf7": "Repositioning the knight.  Side note Qh4+? g3 Qxg4?? Ne5+ winning the queen.\n",
        "10... Qf6": "Trying to force the knight to complete its path.\n",
        "11. Nxe5+ Kb6 12. Nc3 c6": "Stopping Nd5\n",
        "13. d4 exd3 e.p.": "exd3 e.p. is practically forced but I'm not sure it helps blacks game after this rather quick combination.\n",
        "14. Be3+ Kc7 15. Ne4 Qd8 16. cxd3": "White has gained total control over the center and most of the black pieces are where they where on move 8.\n",
        "16... Bg7 17. Ng5": "Gives black all kinds of problems to deal with.\n",
        "17... Re8": "(!) keeps black in the game Qg8 fails to save the dsb.  This statement is rather hard to explain with the many different various moves, but I'm rather sure Qg8 losses the dsb at best.\n",
        "18. O-O-O": "18. Ne6+? Rxe6 19. Bxe6 Bxe5 20. fxe5 Qxd3 and white looks to be trapped out in the open, with the bishop on e3 hanging.\n",
        "18... Bxe5": "Black finally gets the trade in.\n",
        "19. fxe5 b6": "Giving the king some space.  Not sure this is the best move but there is nothing wrong with it.\n",
        "20. Rhf1": "threatening Rf7+\n",
        "20... Qd5": "Gets out of the fork but ignores the threat of Rf7+\n",
        "21. Rf7+ Kd8": "This is the only real move in the situation.  \n",
        "22. Rxh7": "Black is in deep water here I had planned for Joanne to try 22... Rxe5 23. Nf7+ Ke8 24. Nxe5 Qxe5 25. Re1! giving the queen few options.\n",
        "22... Qxa2": "Qxa2?? loses rather quickly to Nf7+.\n",
        "23. Nf7+": "Ke7 or Qxf7 or the only options.  Kc7 leads to mate Kc7 24. Nd6+ (Re7 25. Rxe7 Nd7  26. Rxd7+ Kb8 27. Rb7#) Kd8 25. Bg5+ forcing Re7 26. Bxe7+ Kc7 27. Bg5+ Qf7 28. Rxf7+ Nd7 29. Rxd7+ Kb8 30. Rb7#.  Qxf7 is ruinous on material but black is going to lose the queen anyway see later moves.\n",
        "23... Ke7 24. Nd6+": "Joanne Resigns here for purpose of explanation I'm going to show up to move 28.  Kd8 leads to mate after 25. Bg5+ Re7 26. Bxe7+ Kc7 27. Bg5+ leading to the earlier mate.\n",
        "24... Kf8 25. Bh6+": "The finisher!\n",
        "25... Kg8 26. Rg7+": "Black now would have two options one mate the other lose of queen and a very precarious position.  Kf8 27. Rf1+ Qf7 28. Rxf7# is the mate option.\n",
        "26... Kh8 27. Nf7+ Qxf7 28. Rxf7": "The final position after all the calculations I made back on 22.Qxa2.\n"
