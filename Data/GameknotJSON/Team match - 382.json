        "2... Nc6": "Some people prefer The Falkbeer variation(2.Nf6) although I believe the Max-Lange defense is better.",
        "3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Bc4": "Four knights Italian variation. Black should be better after Nxe5.",

        "5... Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Ng3": "I think Neg5+ was better.",
        "7... Bc5 8. d3 Rf8 9. Bg5 Qd6 10. Nh4 Kg8": "Uncovers the attack on f2. O-O was fine and so was Rf1. I think white tried to castle on the queenside to make a more intresting game.",
        "11. a3": "A huge blunder. Gives me a free pawn on f2 with check.",
        "11... Bxf2+ 12. Kd2 d4": "Advancing my pawns and trying to trap the bishop with h6. ",

        "17... Rxf2+ 18. Kc1": "What was he thinking? Ke1 was possible but I believe the game was already over. White could throw as many checks at me but at the end he would run out. The best white could do here was. 18. Ke1 Qxg2 19. Qh8+  and that's the end after Kf7.",
        "18... Qxg2 19. Kb1 Qh3": "Offering the exchange of queens. I have a strong attack going on not to mention that I'm a piece and 2 pawns up.",
        "20. Qxg5 Qg2": "This essentially forces the exchange of queens. I'm threatening Rxc2 and the queen with my queen.\n",
