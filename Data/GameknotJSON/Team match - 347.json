        "1. e4": "I would like to show this game simply for the sake of showing it \nIt s quite interesting, at least that is what I think.",
        "1... e5 2. Nc3": "The vienna game, not too popular nowadays because it gives white a defencive position, but I do not judge an opening until i've played it.",
        "2... Nf6 3. f4": "This is one the main lines of the opening, an other is Bc4?",
        "3... exf4": "More correct would be d5 so as not to give up the center.",
        "4. Bc4 Bb4": "This is not a mistake, but along with his next move, I must say it is.\nAlso it is better to develop knights before bishops ( just an opinion)",
        "5. e5 Qe7": "Thinks of pinning the pawn. But it is only temporary.",
        "6. Qe2 Ng8": "Has nowhere else to run. All other spots are attacked by white's pieces and and not one square is really challenged by black.",
        "7. Nd5 Qc5 8. a3 Ba5 9. b4 Qd4": "Bxb4 is a bit better, followed by axb4, Qc6 followed by black's knight to e8 to get rid of the centrally positiond white knight.",
        "10. c3 f3 11. Nxf3 Qg4 12. bxa5": "Threatens Kxc8+",
        "12... Kd8 13. d4": "Threatens Bg5+, Ke8, Nxc7+, Kf8 and Rf1 threatening checkmate.",
        "13... Nc6": "Stops it, \neg. Bg5+, Kge7",
        "14. Ng5": "The same implications apply to this position as mentioned before.",
        "14... Qxe2+ 15. Kxe2 Nh6 16. Rf1 Nxa5 17. Nxf7+ Nxf7 18. Rxf7 Nxc4": "He does not see the trap and the game is lost. Black should have replied by h6 and white moves to d3.\nThe next few moves are nothing special but, it looks good.",
        "19. Bg5+ Ke8 20. Re7+ Kf8": "If Kd8 then Re6 checkmate.",
        "21. Rf1+": "Continued by Kg8 and Re8#."
