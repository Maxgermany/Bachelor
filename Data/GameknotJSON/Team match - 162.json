Bxc8": "Whoa, the queen is worth more than the rook.  I'm thinking Qa2, maybe.\n\nJustinkropf points out PxQe2 ends badly for black with Rd8#.  So never mind my comment.",
        "29... Rxc8 30. Rxc3": "The queen is still worth more than the bishop.  Bf5 prevents RxRc8#.  Black's best move looks like PxQe2 still.  Sorry, Sonata296 is correct--PxQe2, RxR, BxR, Rd8#.  My bad--that queen remains immune to the pawn threat.",

White has to do something to prevent QxPg2#, but if the black queen can be persuaded to leave the g file white could do to black the same.\n\nEven better--32. RcxPd3.  BxR, 33. RxB.  If RxR, Qb8+ leads to 35. QxRd8# (after interposition).  QxR and QxPg7# (with that bishop tucked in the a1 pocket covering).\n",
