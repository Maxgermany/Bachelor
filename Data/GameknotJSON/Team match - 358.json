        "6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Be7 8. Qf3 Qc7 9. O-O-O Nbd7 10. g4 b5 11. Bxf6 Nxf6 12. g5 Nd7 13. a3": "Everything normal untill now. The most popular move is f5, but I really prefer to play a solid game with a3!",
        "13... Rb8 14. Qh5": "The normal move in this situation, should be something like h4. Instead, I played Dh5. Trying to confuse my opponent.",
        "14... O-O": " I was expecting something like Nc5 or Nb6, but he played a natural 0-0. ",
        "15. f5": "Here, I think I made a mistake. f5 is not a bad move at all, but 15.Td3 g6 16.Dh6 Te6 17. Th3 Nf8 and then 18. f5, gives me much more chances!",
        "15... Qc5": "Now I thought my opponent would make something like b4, trying to create some counter-play! I think the move Qc5 gives me a tempo for preparing my attack with Rg1 ",
        "16. Rg1 Nb6 17. Qf3": "Another blunder! Qf3, gives some chances for black, to play Na4 and begin some counter-play. I scanned this position on my program, and with 17. Td3, i had a score of +3. Withe Qf3, only +0.8",
        "17... e5 18. b4 Qc7 19. Ncxb5": "With the idea of not giving black the chances for some attack, I sacrificed my knight for 3 pawns. A good choice, i think. I'll win the b, a and later on the d pawn.",
        "19... axb5 20. Nxb5 Qc6": "Qc6 gives me the chance to win one more tempo, and a stronger board position!",
        "21. f6 Bd8 22. Rxd6 Qe8 23. fxg7 Kxg7 24. Rh6": "To prepare the ultimate idea of Nd6..",
        "24... Rh8": "A blunder...",
        "25. Nd6": "Nd6, much more stronger than Qh5. Here is a possible continuation: 25. Nd6 Qg8 26. Qh5 Kf8 27. g6 fxg6 28. Qxe5 Be6 29. Bb5 Ke7 30. Nf5 Kf8 31 Nd4, and Black is hoppeless. Thank you for watching! Comment and give me your ideas. Thank you!"
