        "14... Bg4 15. Qb7 Nd7": "Uh, no.  The knight here blocks black's white bishop (Bg4) from protecting against Qc8#.  Kd8 is recommended instead, though that pretty much only delays the inevitable at this point.  Kd8, Nf7+, and the king must return to e8 where the queen checkmates.\n\nBlack lost the queen and both rooks to knight forks.  The lesson here is to watch out for knight forks.  How best to prevent these?\n\n",
