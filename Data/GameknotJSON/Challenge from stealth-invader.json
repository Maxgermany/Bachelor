        "1. d4 d5 2. Nd2": "?! Hmm... I suppose he's headed for the stonewall, but I don't really like this move it blocks in his DSB.",
        "2... c5": "Well I'm the most comfortable with the queen's gambit so why not?",
        "3. c3 cxd4 4. cxd4 Nc6": "Now that the c pawns are gone his knight on d2 looks a little out of place.",
        "5. e3": "Well he continues with his stonewall anyway.",
        "5... Bf5 6. a3": "?! I don't think this accomplishes much.",
        "6... e6 7. f4": "Common in stonewall, this creates a huge hole on e4 which a black knight loves to fill.",
        "7... Bd6": "I develop my bishop to a nice square.",
        "8. Ngf3 Nf6": "Ready to hop onto e4.",
        "9. Ne5 Bxe5 10. fxe5": "I know that the doubled f pawns are very common in the stonewall.",
        "10... Ne4": "He can trade but then I get a *very* nice bishop instead of a *very* nice knight.",
        "11. Bd3": "Extra pressure but misses...",
        "11... Qh4+": "Zap!",
        "12. g3 Nxg3": "! Discovers an attack on his bishop, and his pawn is pinned to his rook.",
        "13. Nf3": "Discovering a defense to his bishop and attacking my queen. Good move.",
        "13... Qh5 14. Kd2 Nxh1": "*Crunch*",
        "15. Qxh1": "Well after that skirmish has died down the dust settles leaving me... Up by the exchange and a pawn.",
        "15... Bxd3 16. Kxd3": "His king is out in the center and it's still only the middlegame... But I don't have many pieces developed so maybe he's okay.",
        "16... Qf5+ 17. Ke2 Qe4": "My queen is very nicely situated on e4, it's central and it pins his knight. Black has a huge advantage. This also threatens Nxd4, as both his knight and his pawn are pinned.",
        "18. Qf1": "He spots the attack.",
        "18... O-O 19. Qh3": "Aiming at my kingside.",
        "19... Rac8": "Trying to get my rook involved.",
        "20. Ng5": "Hmm, hoping I'll move off that diagonal? But it's a blunder because...",
        "20... Nxd4+": "Of this!",
        "21. Kf2 Rc2+": "My pieces swarm in!",
        "22. Kg3 Nf5+": "!! He has to sac his queen!",
        "23. Qxf5 Qxf5": "Well skirmish No. 2 has ended, leaving my up by... ten points. Easy game now.",
        "24. Nf3": "He's going to make it as hard as he can.",
        "24... Qg6+ 25. Kh3 Qh5+ 26. Kg3 Rc4": "I don't really have any particular plan, just trying to find a weakness.",
        "27. Kf2 Qg4": "I inch closer.",
        "28. Bd2 f5": "If he (unwisely) takes en-passant then my f rook will join in the attack.",
        "29. Rg1": "He does his best to defend.",
        "29... Qh3": "I was tempted to just take his rook, but decided it might go faster this way.",
        "30. Rg3 Qh5": "He chases my queen around for a while:",
        "31. Rg5 Qh6 32. e4 Rxe4 33. Rg2 Qh5 34. Rg5 Qe8": "My queen says enough is enough and runs away to e8.",
        "35. Rg3 Qb5": "Not for long though. this threatens something very nasty and very obvious.",
        "36. Ng1 Qxb2 37. Nf3": "White is hopeless, his bishop is pinned and he's down twelve. I should just get my other rook into the game and then I'll win. Although, it turns out I don't need it.",
        "37... Rf4 38. Kg1 Rxf3": "! If he takes then I take his bishop ending up with two minor pieces for a rook.",
        "39. Bh6": "! I give him this just for threatening mate when he's so far behind.",
        "39... Qf2+": "I almost played Rc8 before I realized what he could do then.",
        "40. Kh1 Qf1+ 41. Rg1 Qxg1+": "He resigns. I felt I played pretty well, please comment and rate."
