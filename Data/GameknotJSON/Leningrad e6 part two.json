        "8. Nb5": "White threatens to win material: Nb5xc7\nAlternative variation: 8. Be3 e6 ; which is supposed to be better, however my aim is e6 after d5 and a kingside attack, so Be3 was not really on my mind.\n",
        "8... Qd7 9. d5": "This push gains space\n",
        "9... a6": "Black threatens to win material: a6xb5\nAlternative variation: 9... c5 10. Qb3\nsort of waste of tempi, but it can be usefull in case of a later ... b5\n",
        "10. Nbd4 Ne4": "Alternative variation: 10... e5 [is noteworthy] 11. dxe6 Qe7 \nI do not really know why black intend to go here at this stage.\n\ne5 which tries to bust black out of his cramped position would certainly have been healthier.\n",
        "11. Ne6 Re8": "Alternative variation: 11... Rf7 12. Nfd4 \nTime to remove the leningrad bishop and take away a very important piece of this structure\n",
        "12. Nxg7": "Alternative variation: 12. Nfd4 Nf6 13. Nxg7 Kxg7 14. Ne6+ Kg8 15. Re1 $18\n\nThe Kingside attack starts!",
        "12... Kxg7 13. Qd4+": "Alternative variation: 13. Ng5 Nxg5 14. Qd4+ Kg8 15. Bxg5 c5 \n\nI did not want to trade of my second knight, since my pieces are way better positioned than blacks.\n",
        "13... Kf7": "Alternative variation: 13... Kg8  [and Black can hope to survive]\n",
        "14. Bh6 Nf6": "!? the only decent move at this stage, since a Qg7 would be really devastating",
        "15. Ng5+ Kg8 16. Bh3": "Alternative variation: 16. c5 dxc5 17. Qxc5 Qd6\n\nI do not understand this proposal of rybka, maybe someone can clairify it for me.",
        "16... c5": "Alternative variation: 16... e5 17. Qh4 Qe7 18. f3 \n\nBlack tries to break out",
        "17. Qc3": "Alternative variation: 17. Qh4 Qc7 18. f3 \n\nof course not dxc, since it is needed to deal with an eventual e5.\nI saw 17. Qh4 but I do not really see an immediate continuation. Still white is overwhelming the king-side while all of blacks remaining pieces are cut off",
        "17... b5": "Alternative variation: 17... Qd8",
        "18. e4": "Deflection: f5\n\nMy idea at this point was to play e4 and maybe follow up with f4 and e5",
        "18... b4": "?? a blunder in a bad position\nAlternative variation: 18... fxe4 19. Bxd7 [Deflection Pinning]\nAlternative variation: 18... Nxe4 19. Qg7# [ Mate attack Deflection]\nAlternative variation: 18... -- 19. exf5 [Threat] gxf5 20. Ne6 [ Combination]\nAlternative variation: 18... Qb7 [Only Hope] 19. Rae1 Nbd7 20. exf5 Nf8 21. g4 bxc4\n",
        "19. Qe3": "Again the target is the weak e6 square",
        "19... Ng4": "?? \nAlternative variation: 19... Rd8 [there is nothing better in the position]\n\nThis ruins black completely, it will open up the file for my queen and all hell can start to break loose.\n",
        "20. Bxg4 fxg4": "Alternative variation: 20... Rf8 [hardly improves anything] 21. exf5 Qe8 22. Ne6 Bxe6 23. Qxe6+ Qf7 24. fxg6 hxg6 25. Rae1 \n\nIt's the end of the 20th turn and neither blacks knight nor blacks bishop are really developed, the rook on the a file is completely useless, whereas white just has to play f3 and it will have total domination on the f file\n",
        "21. Qf4": "\"drop by mate threat\" after 22. Qf7+ Kh8 23. Bg7#",
        "21... e5 22. dxe6 e.p. Qe7": "Mate in 3: 23. Qxf7+ Qxf7 24. xf7 Kh8 25 xe8R#\n\nThe game and annotation was very entertaining for me, at least, since it was a solid attack that focused mainly on one square/was shaped by one thought. (unfortunately my other games of the tournament won't turn out that lucky for me :D)\n\nHope you enjoyed and thx for all incoming clarification."
