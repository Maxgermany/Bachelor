    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5": "Black opts for the agressive sicilian line. Immediately it was tempting for me to accept a cramped position to avoid playing someone in their area of expertise, but i considered the rating difference and went ahead with mainline stuff.",
        "2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3": "This is basically as far as my book knowledge goes in exact moves, although i know the principles of attack for both sides. Black aims to pawn storm on the queenside, and white tries to do the same on the kingside.",
        "5... e6": "I know black here normally plays a6, but for the life of me i couldn't remember what he got out of it. Possibly, it is played to facilitate e5, so if he just accepts a more conservative e6 maybe it wins him a tempo?",
        "6. g4": "Pushing on the kingside. I decided to go for it as early a possible, before i'd developed my pieces or got my king safe, because i know how quick attacks normally come in the sicilian. note that to attack this unprotected pawn with his bishop black would have to lose a tempo by pushing the e pawn again (and i'd play Nf5).",
        "6... h6 7. f4 a6": "He ended up playing this pawn move anyway. Maybe he should've played it earlier and my pawns wouldn't look so strong in the middle if i let him play e5.",
        "8. Qf3": "This move is strong because it stops black from pushing his b pawn and adds strength to all of white's pushed pawns.",
        "8... Be7 9. Be3": "This move serves no purpose other than preparing to castle my king. I was eager to get my rook on the semi open file opposing his queen.",
        "9... b5": "b5?? This is black's first obvious mistake, losing him material.",
        "10. e5": "Either the rook or the knight has to fall. The best move here would be Nd5, reducing black's material disadvantage to a pawn, but the queen would be left on a powerful square threatening black's weakest pawn and his rook.",
        "10... d5": "This is probably worst, because at least if he loses his rook my attack will be delayed a bit. This way white can launch into an attack right out of the opening.",
        "11. exf6 Bxf6 12. Bd3": "White develops his last piece, whilst black still has two minors in their starting blocks. ",
        "12... Bb7": "Black has no way of shifting the white pieces from d4, so this move is pretty pointless. Possibly better is Nd7, discouraging any further pawn pushes on white's kingside (specifically the f pawn, or anything defended by the f pawn).",
        "13. O-O-O": "I saw a game recently where white castled kingside. Although in my position, i've already pushed two of my pawns so it may be questionable, arguably most of black's pieces are on the queenside, whereas most of white's are on the kingside. Maybe a kingside castling would've worked here too.",
        "13... Nd7": "Well played.",
        "14. Qg3": "A quiet move, but not altogether bad. White moves his queen off a potentially vulnerable diagonal and adds another attacker to the g5 square he is about to try and claim, whilst making all pawn pushes feasible again.",
        "14... Rc8": "It's difficult to see what black should've played here. Clearly he needs to get his king safe, but castling into all the white pieces is questionable. This move, however, achieves nothing.",
        "15. h4 Be7": "Possibly clearing the way for his knight, here. ",
        "16. g5 Nf8": "Black tries to protect his king, but removes any chance of castling. I was looking for a smothered mate here, they make me feel clever, but couldn't find one. I was by this stage already confident of a win, though.",
        "17. gxh6 Rxh6": "Rxh6? Allows the f pawn to be pushed further, striking out at the pawns right in front of the king.",
        "18. f5 Rxh4 19. fxe6": "White takes the correct pawn. If black retakes, he severely weakens a diagonal leading into his king. If he doesn't, exf7 does the job instead.",
        "19... fxe6": "Look at all the pieces between my rook and black's queen. This game perfectly demonstrates the vulnerability an xray attack here despite any apparent strength.",
        "20. Nf3": "This move sets a trap.",
        "20... d4": "Has black fallen for it?",
        "21. Rhf1": "I love this game because here things are looking not altogether horrible for black if you look at it from his side of the board. His king is fairly exposed with no safe home, but he's just managed to go up in material for the first time in the game and he'll have a very powerful pawn just two moves away from promotion. \r\n\r\nJust see how passive this move looks. Beautiful!",
        "21... dxe3": "Yep. The bait is taken. This move unleashes an attack on black that is quite literally unstoppable.\r\n\r\n(also note that he was looking to put his pawn on e2 for another fork here, but better would've been taking the knight, winning him another pawn for his rook and opening a channel into the white king for his bishop. Not that black ever had the time to move his pawn again in this match.) ",
        "22. Bg6+ Nxg6": "Forced",
        "23. Qxg6+ Kf8": "Forced",
        "24. Nxh4+": "White is happy to keep bringing his pieces closer to the black king before claiming his prize. ",
        "24... Bf6": "The alternative, Kg8, loses to \r\n\r\n25. Rxd8  Bxd8 \r\n26. Qxe6  Kh8\r\n27. Rf8  Kh7\r\n28. Qg6#\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n25. Rxd8  Rxd8\r\n26. Qxe6  Kh7\r\n27. Qxe7 ",
        "25. Rxd8+ Rxd8 26. Rxf6+": "A rook sacrafice to garuntee white's victory.",
        "26... gxf6 27. Qxf6+ Ke8": "(anything else loses the rook)",
        "28. Ng6": "And there you have it.\r\n\r\n 28...Rd7? 29.Qf8#.",
        "28... Bc8": "?",
