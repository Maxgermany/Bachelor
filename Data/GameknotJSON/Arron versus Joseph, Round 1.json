        "1. e4": "~ A friendly between myself and another fellow community theatre player. Our First Round of three games, which saw me winning two-out-of-three.",
        "1... g6": "Surprised he would concede the Centre so naively! Fianchetto soon?",
        "2. f4": "King's Gambit, my all-time favorite.",
        "2... Bg7": "Cutting across the major diagonal, but the Knights are still back.",
        "3. Nf3": "King's Knight's Gambit.",
        "3... Nf6": "Horse will be harassed there.",
        "4. e5 Nd5": "Black's losing tempo.",
        "5. d4": "Perhaps my Pawns are too far forward, but I like the domination of space I have here.",
        "5... O-O": "An early decision to Castle, but poorly developed in my honest opinion.",
        "6. Bc4": "It will be interesting to see how Black deals with pressure on this Knight.",
        "6... Nb6": "So now both Knights are pushed into the perimeter. I'll maintain my Bishop.",
        "7. Bb3 d5": "No desire to take the d-Pawn, here. I prefer the flood technique in the Middle.",
        "8. Nc3": "Finally I get to push out another Horse.",
        "8... Bg4": "The desire to clear out Pawns Kingside makes me feel comfortable with the Bishop pin. Black is not a threat to me right now.",
        "9. Be3": "Getting the second Priest out of my way. But I don't have a role for him in this game.",
        "9... Nc4": "Forked! I knew it was not a sound decision to move the Bishop that far. I will not exchange the Bishop for a Knight.",
        "10. Bf2 Nc6": "I think I still have the advantage, but what I'm about to do with my light-squared Bishop is maddening!",
        "11. Ba4 Nxb2": "Forked, Part II! What was I thinking?",
        "12. Qb1 Nxa4 13. Nxa4": "I am down in material one Pawn. Yet I feel that I will be compensated.",
        "13... Bxf3": "Doubling my Pawns, Black is so predictable!",
        "14. gxf3 f6": "This next one could be a poison Pawn if Black plays it right.",
        "15. Qxb7 Na5": "Perhaps the only choice? But it takes the Knight out of the fight. A Knight on the rim is grim.",
        "16. Qa6": "e6's Square is tempting me! This could be the break I am looking for.",
        "16... c5": "Blunder! I can finally cause chaos. 16 ... c6 would not have afforded me this chance.",
        "17. Qe6+": "Black should retreat the King to h8!",
        "17... Rf7": "Pin! Now my Knight is back in the battle.",
        "18. Nxc5": "Will Black offer a exchange of Queens?",
        "18... Qc8 19. Qxd5": "The d-Pawn suffers for this!",
        "19... fxe5": "Trying to get compensation for the lost material, but it allows me to break up my Doubled-Pawns along the f-File.",
        "20. fxe5 Qf8": "Black's Queen is sliding laterally along the Back Rank.",
        "21. Ne6": "Now Black is finally forked, obvious choice is to spare the Queen.",
        "21... Qc8 22. Nxg7": "With a pinned-Rook, only the King can capture.",
        "22... Kxg7 23. Qxa5": "And the forgotten Knight pays the price.",
        "23... Qxc2": "At this point I stand to lose some Pawns.",
        "24. O-O": "Perhaps I am Castling to early. Or too late.",
        "24... Rxf3": "I should have managed my Bishops better in this match.",
        "25. Rac1 Qf5 26. Rc7": "A decision to attack aggressively almost cost me in this game. I have chosen the f7 Square to focus my power, and Black chooses f1.",
        "26... Rf8 27. Qd5": "Both Kings are unsafe.",
        "27... Rxf2": "A kind of Alekhine's gun. We'll call it Joseph's gun. He almost makes a thrilling comeback, seizing my Bishop and threatening Mate.",
        "28. Rxe7+": "My one move left! I hope he blocks with the Rook. If Kh8, then it's over. I would be trapped.",
        "28... Rf7": "Blunder!",
        "29. Rxf7+": "An obvious choice for me!",
        "29... Qxf7": "Of course we'll exchange! I have more Pawns!",
        "30. Qxf7+ Rxf7": "And my Rooks have X-Ray Eyes! :P",
        "31. Rxf7+ Kxf7 32. Kf2 Ke6 33. Ke3": "I win the footrace to my back Pawn!",
        "33... h5 34. h4": "Locking up the Kingside.",
        "34... a5 35. a4": "Locking up the Queenside, to complete the Zugzwang.",
        "35... Kd5": "Combinational Chess Theory. I don't see a way for Black to win. I can kill off Pawns on either side of the Board with my King, while promoting to Queen before Joseph.",
        "36. Kd3": "What a game!"
