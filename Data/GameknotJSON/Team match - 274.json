        "2. e4": "I hog the center",
        "2... e5": "? This is odd, but if I take his pawn then he can't recapture for fear of Qh5+",
        "3. dxe5 fxe5": "?? Uh oh I think you know what's coming.",
        "4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8": "And his rook drops off. In almost all the games I've played where I win his rook like this it is a fast game where I win quickly instead of just exchanging off material and coming into a won endgame.",
        "6... Qxe4+": "I did expect this.",
        "7. Ne2": "If I blocked with my bishop that would allow Qxg2.",
        "7... Bb4+ 8. Bd2 Kf8": "Odd that he didn't exchange off his bishop for mine I mean I know he's behind but I think it would have been better to exchange.",
        "9. Nbc3": "! This breaks the pin on my DSB and attacks his queen.",
        "9... Qxc2": "I knew he could do that, but from now on he'll move nothing but his king.",
        "10. Bh6+ Kf7 11. Qg7+": "I'm looking for a mating net.",

        "13. Qf8+": "I play this.",
        "13... Ke6": "Hmm, looks like there's nothing better than Qxc8 as Nd4+ doesn't win his queen because my queen is attacked. Then I noticed",
        "14. Nd4+": "! That this is good after all.",
        "14... Ke5 15. Bg7#": "And...Checkmate! I liked this game and would appreciate comments and a rating."
