        "1. e4 d5 2. exd5": "I went with the Scandinavian defence. I did not want to move my queen in the early game and decided to attack the pawn with my knight.",
        "2... Nf6 3. c4": "He protects it and opens a way for his queen to move out.",
        "3... c6": "I offer my c pawn and he takes it",
        "4. dxc6 e5": "and my b pawn too!",
        "5. cxb7 Bxb7": "Even tough I am down by two pawns I got a lot of space and developed my white bishop and the king-side knight\nUsually I only give up my c pawn and develop my knight. I wanted to try something which is new to me so let's see what is going to happen next. ",
        "6. Nf3 e4 7. Qe2": "I move forward aggressively",
        "7... Bd6 8. Ng5 O-O 9. Nc3 Re8": "protecting that pawn, it seemed that my pawn sacrifice at the beginning did not work out as well as I hoped. \nI plan is to get them away from the centre.",
        "10. b3 h6 11. Nh3 Qc7 12. Bb2": "white wisely develops his bishop. We each have a nice diagonal now.\nI hesitate and don't know what to do next. The double threat on his h2 pawn comes to mind. I am down to pawns, so why not grab it?",
        "12... Bxh2 13. g3": "This looks bad at first but tuns out that he had made a mistake, trying to block my bishop on his way out.",
        "13... Bxg3 14. fxg3 Qxg3+ 15. Nf2 e3": "I belive he did not want to move his king and give up the option to castle long. His knight is trapped. ",
        "16. O-O-O exf2 17. Qxe8+ Nxe8": "Blunder by my opponent. ",
        "18. Rh3 Qg4 19. Re3 Nf6 20. Bh3 Qh4 21. Nb5": "If I would have moved my king to f8 I would have prevented some material loss. \nI just did not see it then ...",
        "21... Nbd7 22. Nd6 Bc6 23. Nf5 Qg5 24. Ne7+": "Here is the fork. My bishop is lost.",
        "24... Kh8 25. Nxc6 Ng4": "I am angry and ready to attack !",
        "26. Rg3 Ndf6": "He starts trading. I have to accept since I moved forward a little quickly.",
        "27. Bxf6 Qxf6 28. Rxg4 Qxc6 29. Bg2 Qc8 30. Bxa8 Qxg4": "Still leading by two points I am happy that I managed to trade equally.\n\nI kept moving all my pawns forward and white resigns when he was loosing his rock which was blocking the f pawn.\nI think the start of the game is more interesting. Do you think this kind of opening would work in a regular game??\n"
