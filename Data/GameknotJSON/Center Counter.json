        "4. Bc4 c6 5. d4 Nf6 6. Bd2 Qc7": "Just basic development.  White is avoiding Nf3 so that black can't play Bg4 with a pin.\n",
        "7. Qe2 Bg4 8. f3": "White will still be able to develop his knight to good effect and black is starting to lag behind in development.\n",
        "8... Bh5 9. O-O-O e6": "Is black thinking of castling king side?  9. .., N(b)d7 followed by O-O-O would have been better.\n",
        "10. Nh3 Nbd7 11. Nf4 Bg6": "White has a surprise.  Do you see it?  White's lead in development should translate to a tactical move.\n",
        "12. Bxe6": "If 12. ..., fxe6, then 13. Nxe6 and the queen is attacked at the same time white threatens 14. Nc7 dbk check which gains the rook.  On 13. Nxe6, Qb8, ( on Qc8, 14. Nxg7dbl ck, Kd8, 15.  Ne6 ck, Ke8 or Ke7 and white still has the discovery ) 14. Nc7 dbl ck, Kd8, 15. Nxa8, Qxa8,  Material maybe close to even but Black's king is still the center and white can push d5 to try and open things up.\n",
        "12... O-O-O 13. Nxg6": "Threatens the rook so that black has to capture the knight.\n",
        "13... fxg6 14. g3 Bd6": "White was going to play Bf4 so black prevents it.\n",
        "15. Ne4": "To prevent white from taking the bishop on d6 he must play 15. ..., Rhe8\n",
        "15... Kb8 16. Nxd6": "After 16. ..., Qxd6 then Bf4 wins the Queen so black resigns.  I hope you enjoy the game please comment if you see improvements.\n"
