        "5... Bb4+ 6. c3": "Not sure what I was doing there.  I'm a young male, perhaps I was daydreaming about other things.",

        "12... cxd4": "I have a plan.  Not a great plan, but my bishop is Private Ryan, and he MUST be saved.",

        "15... Bxh4+ 16. Ke2": "Taking Private Brian doesn't save the game.  I don't think so anyways, I analyzed it to an extent.",
        "16... Nxf4+": "Now Private Hoof gets a piece of King Henry the Eighth.",
        "17. Ke3 Rxc3+ 18. Kxf4": "Private Hoof dies.  At least his brave sacrifice didn't go in vain.",
        "18... Qd6#": "And Queen Elizabeth shows why killing your wives isn't a good idea.  Thank you for reading my inane commentary about a silly chess game."
