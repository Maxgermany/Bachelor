        "8... Bc5 9. Nb3 Bxf2+": "[?!]\nThe quieter 9.\u2026 Bd6 10.d4 Nxe4 is preferable, but the text definitely gets White's attention, just not enough of it.",

Ke3": "[?]\nOblivious to his danger White neglects to address Black\u2019s threat of getting his queen into play with check.  11.Kf1 seems best; granted it locks in his h-rook, but up a bishop and ahead in development White can surely find the extra tempi to get that rook out of hock.",
