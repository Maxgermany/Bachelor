        "1. e4": "Hi Everybody, just for a change I thought I would comment on an old beginner game that I found in a buddy's profile.  Sometimes in these games, even when heavy material is lost it can be regained.  This was not the case here.  Thought it would be worth annotating because it would be interesting to see your thoughts on good and bad development in this game.  Cheers.  Joanne",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 Bg4": "3. ........ Bg4 - the Philidor's Defense",
        "4. d3": "4. d3?! not sure about this move - cuts off bishop from breaking the pin on g4.",
        "4... Nc6 5. h3 Be6 6. Bxe6 fxe6 7. Ng5": "7. Ng5 - perhaps Nc3 or Be3 may be better here.",
        "7... Nd4 8. c3 h6 9. cxd4 hxg5 10. dxe5 dxe5 11. Nc3 Bb4 12. a3 Bc5": "12. ........ Bc5 - white has developed a knight since the picture in the last diagram and perhaps stands a little better due to black's shattered pawn structure.  The black bishop now gets chased around.",
        "13. b4 Bd4 14. Nb5": "14. Nb5?? - but this just drops a rook, white should have played Bb2 here (Bd2 drops the d pawn to the black queen).",
        "14... Bxa1 15. Qe2 c6 16. Bb2 Bxb2 17. Qxb2 cxb5 18. Qxe5 Qxd3 19. Qxg7 Qe2+": "19........   Qe2 ?? - loses Q for nothing as the e2 square is not backed up by another black piece.\r\n",
        "20. Kxe2 Rd8 21. Qxh8 Kd7 22. Qd4+ Kc7 23. Rc1+ Kb8 24. Qxd8#": "24.  Black played on after losing his queen, blundered further material and then copped Old Matey a few moves later."
