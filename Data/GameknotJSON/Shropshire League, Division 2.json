    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "I am annotating this at the request of my friend Jon. This is a fascinating draw, white gains a pawn, but black gets just enough initiative to hold the balance, and manages to draw an opposite coloured bishop ending two pawns down. A very instructive game!",
        "1... e5": "Conventional first move.",
        "2. c4": "But this is very strange. White should really be developing.",
        "2... c5": "Black settles for symmetrical equality, but I think black would do better to develop too.",
        "3. Nf3": "White attacks e5",
        "3... Nc6": "Black protects",
        "4. Nc3": "he other knight emerges",
        "4... Nf6": "As does black.",
        "5. d3": "Opens a diagonal for his bishop.",
        "5... h6": "Black stops the Bc1 from coming out to g5. An unnecessary precaution in my view, but it has been played before.",
        "6. h3": "Now it is white's turn to copy. Even more mind-boggling - black presumably wants to develop Bc1 to e3 and doesn't like the idea of black playing Nf6-g4. It has been seen before.",
        "6... d6": "And black restores the symmetry in the position.",
        "7. Be3": "White carries on with the plan.",
        "7... Be7": "Black also develops his bishops.",
        "8. Be2": "As does white.",
        "8... Be6": "Again symmetrical! I can find 6 games on the Gameknot database with this position.",
        "9. Rb1": "But this is new. Previously Qd2, a3 and Nd5 had all been seen twice. White is planning b2-b4.",
        "9... a6": "Is black also considering b7-b5 - I am not sure.",
        "10. a3": "There is almost a theme to this game with both players copying each others moves!",
        "10... O-O": "A sensible move, surprised it has not been played earlier.",
        "11. b4": "White does his break.",
        "11... cxb4": "Black takes.",
        "12. axb4": "White takes back.",
        "12... Rb8": "Black seems to prepare the same break.",
        "13. b5": "But white gets in first.",
        "13... axb5": "Another pawn exchange. Which way would you take back dear reader?",
        "14. Rxb5": "Fritz likes taking with the pawn at first, but finally settles on the rook take. White saddles black with an isolated pawn on an open b file.",
        "14... b6": "I am not sure that the pawn is any easier to defend on this square. Fritz considers Qc8, Bd7, Nd7 and Ne8 here and considers the position better for white.",
        "15. Qb1": "White correctly gangs up on b6.",
        "15... Nd7": "Black correctly protects b6 again.",
        "16. Na4": "White add's a 4th attacker of b6 and now there is no way for black to protect it.",
        "16... Na7": "Black attacks the rook. Taking on b6 with the knight now loses the exchange, so....",
        "17. Bxb6": "White takes with the bishop instead, forking queen and knight.",
        "17... Nxb6": "So black takes.",
        "18. Rxb6": "White has to take back with rook rather than knight of course, as his rook is still en prise. ",
        "18... Rxb6": "Black takes again.",
        "19. Qxb6": "White takes back with the queen, following the advice to exchange pieces but not pawns when materially ahead.",
        "19... Qxb6": "Black takes.",
        "20. Nxb6": "White takes back.",
        "20... Rb8": "Black attacks the knight.",
        "21. Na4": "The only way of saving the knight without losing material.",
        "21... Rb1+": "Black correctly throws in a check. Of course moving the king to d2 loses the rook on h1 and castling out of check is illegal, so....",
        "22. Bd1": "This is the only way to save material.",
        "22... Bd7": "Black attacks the knight.",
        "23. Nc3": "The knight drops back.",
        "23... Rc1": "White attacks the rook. In view of what happens next, I ran this move through to see if Ra1 was better, and was surprised to see that Fritz likes 23...Rb2 with about 0.47 advantage to white.",
        "24. Kd2": "White protects the knight and attacks the Rc1. Fritz puts white 0.81 ahead now.",
        "24... Ra1": "So the rook maintains the pin on the bishop.",
        "25. Ne1": "White comes up with a plan to drive the black rook off the first rank. Fritz prefers 25. Re1 presumably because 25. Ne1 allows....",
        "25... Bg5+": "This check. Fritz agrees that this check is best.",
        "26. Ke2": "Fritz prefers Kc2.",
        "26... Nc6": "This move looks good to me, although Fritz prefers 26...Ra3",
        "27. Nc2": "Best according to Fritz",
        "27... Rc1": "Fritz prefers retreating the rook to a5 or a6.",
        "28. h4": "This is what Fritz would play. Fritz gives it as plus 1.66 to white now...",
        "28... Nd4+": "The only move to keep black in the game. Bishop retreats are met with Kd2 winning the exchange and 28....Bf4? runs into 29. g3!",
        "29. Nxd4": "Equally white is forced to take. 29. Kf1?? Nxc2 and white cannot recapture as the Bd1 is pinned.",
        "29... exd4": "and now black is counter-attacking the Nc3.",
        "30. Nd5": "Knight advances to a dominating square, but Fritz prefers Nb5 forking the pawns on d4 and d6.",
        "30... Bd8": "Black avoids putting his bishop on f6 allowing Nxf6 doubling and isolating black's king-side pawns.",
        "31. Kd2": "White attacks the rook again.",
        "31... Ra1": "Rook goes back to a1.",
        "32. g3": "Protecting g3. Maybe white wants to play 33. Bf3.",
        "32... Ba5+": "Black throws in a check.",
        "33. Ke2": "The white king runs.",
        "33... Ra2+": "Probably the wrong check, as Fritz prefers 33.....Bg4+ 34. f3 Bd7 and white is rather tied up, for instance 35. Ne7+ Kf8 36. Nf5 Ra2+ 37. Kf1 Bxf5 38. exf5 and it is hard for white to untangle his pieces. Black would have adequate compensation for the minus pawn and doubled d pawns. Chances would be equal, according to Fritz. ",
        "34. Kf3": "Now the white king is heading to g2.",
        "34... Ra1": "White resumes his pin.",
        "35. Kg2": "But now the Bd1 can safely move. White is again nearly a clear pawn ahead.",
        "35... Be6": "Hoping to exchange off the powerful knight, and also head into an opposite coloured bishop end-game - which are notoriously drawn - sometimes - like this game later on - even though a side may be two pawns down.",
        "36. Nf4": "White correctly moves the knight.",
        "36... g5": "Black insists!",
        "37. Nxe6": "White takes, and Fritz likes this move, but I have my doubts about this move, as it leaves opposite coloured bishops and black is able to draw, so I think it is correct not to exchange. Any thoughts dear reader?",
        "37... fxe6": "Black takes back.",
        "38. Bg4": "This clever move nets a second pawn. Fritz prefers exchanging on g5 first. Black has rook and pawn attacked. This is one time it is correct to exchange pieces when materially down, as the opposite bishops ending is easier to win with rooks on.",
        "38... Rxh1": "So black correctly takes.",
        "39. Bxe6+": "And white cleverly takes the pawn with check before recapturing the rook. A good example of a Zwischenzug. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwischenzug",
        "39... Kg7": "Black has to get out of check.",
        "40. Kxh1": "Now the rook is recaptured.",
        "40... gxh4": "Black correctly takes the pawn.",
        "41. gxh4": "White recaptures. Because of the drawing power of opposite coloured bishops, Fritz puts white as \"only\" 0.88 up.",
        "41... Bd8": "Black attacks the h pawn.",
        "42. h5": "It is forced up the board. Fritz - perhaps seeing the game continuation, prefers 42. f4",
        "42... Kf6": "White comes to attack it with his king, attacking the bishop en route.",
        "43. Bf5": "The bishop drops back.",
        "43... Kg5": "King attacks the pawn.",
        "44. Bg6": "Bishop protects, but this natural move throws away white's winning chances. Fritz likes 44. Kg2 sacrificing the h pawn, but clearing the way for the f pawn to advance.",
        "44... Kf4": "and now it is impossible for white to mobile the passed f pawn.",
        "45. Kg2": "White moves his king up.",
        "45... Bg5": "Random bishop move.",
        "46. e5": "This seems a desperate sacrifice by white to try and win. Fritz gives best as 46. Be8 with plus 0.81 to white, but this position after 46. Be8 seems drawn to me. Any views dear reader?",
        "46... Kxe5": "Fritz prefers taking with the pawn, although I can understand why Jon didn't want to give his opponent another passed pawn. The score-sheet now records 47. Bc1 as the last move of the game, but I assume that to be a mistake? Presumable white played a move and then black played Bc1. Fritz is still giving an advantage to white - of plus 0.91 - but it seems completely drawn to me. Any views dear reader? Please rate this annotation with the star system and leave a comment or two. Until next time dear reader!"
