        "1. e4": "I start off with my usual.",
        "1... Nf6": "And, I'm not surprised to see her play the Reti Defense, I believe it's called.  Still develops, but my response will be a little different then normal since she is threatening to win a pawn.  So, I'll protect in a way that also develops.",
        "2. Nc3 d5": "With this move, we're in familiar territory.  Although it didn't transpose into the Scandinavian Defense, since the N aren't out in that defense until we exchanged, I'll treat it like it did since this is my style.  This means that we're going to exchange pawns.  ",
        "3. exd5 Nxd5 4. Nxd5": "Unfortunately, this game happened before my first lesson with Ken.  Therefore, I exchange pieces just because it's possible to do so.  Now, how this game occurred after the lesson, I would've denied it with 5.Ne2, followed by 6.Nf4, to leave my N well placed as, in theory, for general games, I might need this at a later time.  But, since this happened before the game, that did not come into consideration.  All I cared about exchanging in order to continue with my development, as we'll see, when 5.Nf3 is played.",
        "4... Qxd5 5. Nf3 Qe6+": "I was not surprised to see this check.  But, since my idea, as noted, was to exchange when possible, I block this check with my Queen and prepare to exchange it.",
        "6. Qe2 Qf5": "But, Annabel declines since she sees something a little better, and thus, eyes my c2 pawn.",
        "7. Nd4": "I had considered protecting by advancing the c pawn.  Another option, which did not come into consideration, was 7.Qd1  But, this was played to harass her Queen.  The goal would be to develop afterwards, but I overlooked her next move which hits my N.",
        "7... Qc5 8. Qe3": "Consequently, protecting it is the number one priority.",
        "8... e5": "So, she hits again.  And, once again, I protect by bringing it back to my original square.  But, I'm also keeping that her next move, therefore, will not win a pawn because with the N there, once she takes, I'll recapture.  So, it will be an even exchange.  Part of it is that she must be careful to avoid a discovered check.  As otherwise, there will be problems, as we're about to see.  It's also worth noting that since this is before my training game, I was only going to look at one variation.   And, the only variation I looked is what happens here.",
        "9. Nf3 Qxc2 10. Nxe5 Be6": "As I was planning to play my next move anyway just because it worked in one game, as at the time, that was all that I was thinking about.  But, even with this move, I'm gonna play it, as I have a sac in mind.  And, this was, btw, the continuation of the variation that I studied earlier with 9.Nf3.",
        "11. Bc4 Bxc4": "?? As Annabel took, which I anticipated.  But, I told her that this is a blunder.  Instead, better was to protect and prevent what's coming.  By that, I was implying that best was 11...f6  By playing this, though, I have a nasty discovered check which going to win the Rook.  And, btw, this is the reason why protecting with Nf3 was the only move that came into consideration, as otherwise, I would've looked at retreating elsewhere.  What I kept in mind for this training game, however, was something that tactical-abyss from his experience.  That is, that most people make this kind of mistake, and when they think they can, they'll take.  But, what they don't know is the consequences affiliated with it, like here.  So, it is good for learning and another example of where I used TA's method to teach chess.",
        "12. Ng6+ Kd8 13. Nxh8 Bd5": "I'm not exactly sure why she played, but nothing stops me from castling here.",
        "14. O-O Bc5": "?? Annabel continues with her development, but I told her that this is another blunder.  In fact, just about anything was better then this move.  That's because of what's about to come which is going to win another piece.  This time, though, it's without anything in return.  Afterwhich, I'm going to win a pawn.  So, from here on, given that white has a won game after 16.Qxd5+, I don't say anything else because the idea is to stop when there are no good moves left and you have a win, as ION mentioned.",
        "15. Qg5+ Be7 16. Qxd5+ Nd7 17. Nxf7+ Kc8 18. Re1": "With that being said, I attack her Be7 by centralizing one of my Rooks.",
        "18... c6": "For now, she protects by attacking my Queen.",
        "19. Qe6": "So, I protect by keeping the attack.  Therefore, she finds another way to protect.",
        "19... Bf6 20. Qe8+": "But, that does not bother me because with this move, I'm going to win her other Rook.  At this point, were I black I'd resign right here due to the ruinous loss of material that I'd be faced with.  She, not to my surprise, however, plays on.",
        "20... Kc7 21. Qxa8 Bxb2": "Thinking that she's got a pawn, in return, Annabel takes here but overlooks the mate that is about to come.  21...Qb6 would've held it off longer, but it's still a lost position for black.  For, had she played that, I would've continued by exchanging bishops since I'm that far ahead.  From there, she'd have nothing left, anyhow.",
        "22. Qd8#": "After this mate, I reviewed the game with Annabel.  And, I told her that black's decisive mistake was taking my B since that overlooked the check which got the R, instead.  As from there, it was gonna go downhill.  So, I told her that the moral of this story is that to take is a mistake.  In other words, don't take just because it's there and you can.  Instead, ask yourself what danger lies ahead.  And, what happens from there.  After that, she thanked me for taking the time to teach her.  In addition, I would, as usual, like to thank TA for giving that mini lesson.  Which is that many people make that kind of mistake because I was able to keep that in mind for this training game.  In doing so, another student of mine learned some chess as a direct result."
