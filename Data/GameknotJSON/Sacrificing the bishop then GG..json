        "3... Nc6": "Well, me too I like to open with this knight. Fischer said d6 was the best continuation, giving the oportunity to pin quickly the knight with Bg4.",
        "4. Bc4 h6": "Thinking about to follow with g5, protecting the f pawn and threatening the king. I still prefer to do directly g5. When playing the king gambit, the tempo is so much important.",
        "5. O-O d6 6. d4 a6": "Thinking to move out my bishop, but by doing so he is losing tempo.",
        "7. Bxf4": "Getting back my pawn.",
        "7... Nge7 8. e5": "Well I was thinking about a way to move away my knight or my bishop to attack f7. If black exchange it will give me this oportunity + it will give me space on the e line.",
        "8... d5": "Well done.",
        "9. Be2": "Getting away of the knight's reach.",
        "9... Be6 10. Nbd2": "Thinking about to continue with c4.",

        "11... Qd7 12. Nc5": "? Well played too quickly here and forgot about the bishop. Rc1 would have been better I think. ",
        "12... Bxc5 13. dxc5": "Now Black got a passed pawn on the center and some of my pawns are pretty weak now.",
        "13... O-O-O 14. b4": "? Well the knight just need to take it.",

        "17. Bxe3 dxe3 18. Qe2": "Qxd7, Rxd7, Bxc6, bxc6 would have gave me a nice position. But I didn't like that e pawn. Black was doing fine at this point.",
        "18... Bd5 19. Ba6": "!! This side of the field is completly unprotected and the b line is freed. I don't think there's a way for black to escape the mate at this point.\n\nIf bxa6, then Qxa6+ followed by Rb1#",
        "19... Bxf3 20. Bxb7+ Kxb7": "If Kb8, then Qa6 then Qa8#.",
        "21. Rab1+ Ka7 22. Qb5": "There's no way out.",
        "22... Rdb8 23. Qa4+ Na5 24. Qxa5#": "Well it was a good game."
