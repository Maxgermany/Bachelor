        "1. f4": "This wild opening finally resulted in a peaceful draw.  How did that happen?  Read on...",
        "1... d5 2. Nf3 g6 3. e4 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4": "The starting point in this themed tournament.",
        "8. Be6+ Kc6 9. Bxg4 Bg7 10. Ne6 Qg8": "This continuation seems to have become the \"main line\".",
        "11. d4 exd3 e.p.": "I learned in an earlier game that Black has to play this capture or White gets a strong attack.",
        "12. cxd3": "Similarly White has to recapture or the Black pawn becomes too powerful.",
        "12... Na6": "This knight threatens to go via b4 to c2 with a powerful fork.",
        "13. a3": "So White prevents it.",
        "13... Nc5": "This active move threatens White's isolani on d3 and also threatens to win a piece on e6.  I don't think I got this move in in our return game and consequently 8ballphoenix maintained his N on e6 for most of the game, eventually mating me on the queenside.",
        "14. Bf3+ Kd6": "Black cleverly avoids the mating net on the queenside by returning to the centre.  Now the white knight has to move.",
        "15. Nxc5": "I think this was the right swap, as it removes Black's most active piece and lures the king out again.  Swapping the Bg7 would not have freed the b-pawn from its pin as the Q would have recaptured.",
        "15... Kxc5 16. Be3+": "The opportunity to check enables White to develop his remaining queenside pieces.",
        "16... Kd6 17. Nc3 Bxc3+": "Black continues to swap at every opportunity, increasing the likelihood of making his Queen tell as the game progresses.",
        "18. bxc3": "Both sides have three pawn islands and both sides have rooks still on their starting positions.  Black's King is marginally more exposed but he has the advantage of Q to 2 Bs.  Black must be favourite at this point.",
        "18... c6 19. O-O Qd8": "A somewhat mysterious looking move.  It recentralises the Q (but behind the K) and gives the Rh8 room to move in case White attacks it with Bd4.  If White had achieved that exchange the material balance would just about have been restored.",
        "20. Bd4 Rf8 21. Be5+": "What a beautiful Bishop!",
        "21... Kd7 22. Rab1": "While he has the initiative it is important that White uses it effectively.  This rook move exploits the half-open b-file, threatening Black's b-pawn.",
        "22... b6": "Black's response weakens and pins the recently advanced c-pawn but the only other ways to defend the b-pawn were 22...Qc8 or 22...Kc8, hardly attractive prospects.",
        "23. Rbd1": "The weakness provoked, the rook's work on the b-file was done, so it refocused on K and Q.  The immediate plan was to advance the d-pawn as quickly as possible.",
        "23... Rc8": "Black releases the pin and develops his rook.  With the last piece developed the opening is over!  In reality we've been embroiled in middle-game tactics and strategic considerations since about move 7.",
        "24. Bg4+": "White seizes the chance to win the exchange.",
        "24... Ke8": "The alternative was 24...e6, which would have made that square the target for White's pressure.  By offering up the Rc8, Black hopes to get rid of White's bishop pair.  The single black-squared prelate should be much less meddlesome.",
        "25. Be6": "White doesn't give up his bishop pair yet, establishing a tight hold on the position.",
        "25... Rc7 26. d4": "Still White doesn't take the hapless rook, advancing the d-pawn as planned.",
        "26... Rd7 27. f5": "Black looks virtually paralysed now.",
        "27... c5": "But at least his pawns have room to move, so he strikes back at d4.  ",
        "28. Bxd7+": "Finally White condescends to win the exchange.",
        "28... Qxd7 29. dxc5": "and a pawn, leaving material mathematically even.",
        "29... Qc6": "but now Black's Q is mobile so Black may actually have the advantage.",
        "30. cxb6 Qxb6+ 31. Kh1": "The White King hides in the corner.  As we move towards the end-game this is not necessarily the best place to be as he will be needed to help out White's remaining pieces.",
        "31... Rxf5 32. Rfe1": "Black won back a pawn and White sensibly avoids exchanging rooks, which would have given Black a won game.",
        "32... Kf7": "Black reactivates his King. He definitely looks favourite now.",
        "33. h3": "White creates a hole for his King",
        "33... Rg5": "Black covers the escape square and prepares a mate threat with ...Qb7 or ...Qc6",
        "34. Bd4 Qb7 35. Ref1+": "Before defendign against the threat, White chases Black's King back.",
        "35... Ke8 36. Rd2": "The defensive move also prepares doubling on either d-file or f-file.  If the rooks work effectively together they can outplay a Q.",
        "36... Qd5": "?! The Q moves into a dominant position but provides White with a tactical shot.",
        "37. Be3": "! Double attack on Q and R, with White's attacking R now defended by the B.",
        "37... Qa5": "Black has to give up the exchange",
        "38. Bxg5 Qxg5 39. Rfd1": "So here we are with 2 Rooks against 1 Queen.  Mathematically White has the advantage but realistically it is likely to end with a perpetual check or threefold repetition unless someone makes a bad error.",
        "39... Qa5": "Black returns his Q to a5, whence he attacks the weak pawns on a3 and c3.  White can't defend both with one move, so he has to look for alternative active plans.",
        "40. Rd2d8+": "?! First of all an offer to swap the Rooks for the Queen, when Black's more central King might be the winning difference but it would probably be drawn.",
        "40... Kf7": "Black reasonably refuses that offer, hoping to sweep up White's pawns before swapping off.",
        "41. Rf1+": "White pursues Black's King, hoping to get into a mating pattern.  He has to be careful not to leave the Rd8 en prise too long though!",
        "41... Ke6 42. Re1+ Kf7": "Already we could agree a draw by repetition here but both players still want more.",
        "43. Rf1+ Kg7": "Black avoids repeating moves and further checks...",
        "44. Rdf8": "White connects his Rooks again, still hoping to trap Black's King on the edge of the board but there are too many pawns around for Black to hide behind.",
        "44... Qxa3": "Black seizes the opportunity to snaffle the a-pawn.  Now his plan should simply be to advance his own a-pawn to promotion.  Interestingly, at the peaceful conclusion, 14 moves later, this pawn still hadn't moved.",
        "45. Rf1f7+ Kh6 46. Rh8": "White hopes to either trap the K or sweep up Black's second rank pawns.  The c-pawn can go hang!",
        "46... Qxc3 47. Rhxh7+ Kg5 48. h4+ Kg4 49. Rfxe7": "White's checks have run out, so he captures the e-pawn.  Now it's Black's turn to deliver some checks and try to trap White's King.  White has helpfully driven Black's King into proximity, so Black has mating potential.",
        "49... Qc1+ 50. Kh2 Qf4+ 51. Kg1 Kg3": "The net closes.  If White doesn't find the correct defence it could be mate in 2.",
        "52. Rhf7 Qd4+ 53. Kf1 Qd1+ 54. Re1 Qd3+ 55. Kg1 Kxh4 56. Rh7+ Kg4 57. Rh3 Qd4+ 58. Kh1 g5": "and Black finally offered a draw, gratefully accepted as White has no obviously strong moves and has the remote a-pawn to worry about."
