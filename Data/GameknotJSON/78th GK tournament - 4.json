        "1. e4 c5": "All right, here we have the sicilian defence.The next move does not comply with any variations of the sicilian.",
        "2. Bc4": "White sets himself up for the scholar's mate. How many times do we have to go through this?",
        "2... Nc6 3. Bxf7+": "If only I played either 2...e3 or 2...Nh6. Now, it's a forced take.",
        "3... Kxf7 4. Qh5+ g6": "It was this or 3...Ke6?!. Definitely do not play 3...Kf6?? 4.Qf5# in this situation.",
        "5. Qxc5": "White's free pawn.",
        "5... Qc7": "Another blunder. Better was 5...Qa5.",
        "6. Ne2 Ke8": "I know I cannot castle any more, but I could probably try placing the King back to it's spot.",
        "7. Qc3": "White's Queen recked havoc on my King and now it's after my Rook!?",
        "7... Nf6 8. d3": "White's on fire, so I decide that the best I can do, is to prepare for his attacks.",
        "8... Bg7 9. O-O Ng4": "This unworthy move costs me my entire King-side. Better was 9...Ng5.",
        "10. Bf4 d6": "I have to admit, I would have a very slim advantage after 10...Bc3. If White responds with 11.Bxc7, then 11...Bxb2 earns me a free Rook.",
        "11. Qxg7 Rf8 12. Qxh7 Nce5 13. d4": "I can possibly take the risk with 13...Qxc2!?.",
        "13... Rf7 14. Qh8+ Rf8 15. Qh4 Nf6": "I'm not sure why I did this move.",
        "16. dxe5 dxe5 17. Bg5 Qxc2": "Too late!!!!!",
        "18. Ng3 Bf5": "Being down on material does not mean this is a logical move.",

        "22. Qa4+ Kf7 23. Na3 Ra6 24. Qc4+ e6": "Why did I not consider 24...Re6.",
        "25. Nb5 Re8": "A totally ill-logical move.",
        "26. Nc7": "This game is thrown out of the window. The Rooks can be saved in a couple of ways.",
        "26... Rc6 27. Qh4 Rxc7 28. Qh7+": "The c7 Rook drowned in hot soup with this astounding Queen check.",
        "28... Kf8 29. Qxc7 Re7": "This move makes matters worse by making White's Queen check me and wriggle my King away from safety.",
        "30. Qd8+": "White has no other help yet and should have delayed this move.",
        "30... Re8 31. Qa5 Qd4 32. Rfd1 b6": "32...Re7 is a way better move than this.",
        "33. Qxa7 Qc5 34. Nh5 Re7 35. Qb8+": "White should have been careful about this move and played 35.Rb8+",
        "35... Re8 36. Qb7 Re7": "I should have been more careful about my Rook. Better was the risky 36.Qe7!?.",
        "37. Rd7 Rxd7 38. Qxd7 Qe7 39. Qc8+": "White should have played 39.Nf6 instead.",
        "39... Qe8 40. Qa6 Qc6 41. Qd3 Qe8 42. Qg3": "Absolutely no guardian for the knight spells trouble, for the 3-move Queen war ends here. However, I did not think that White had another possible advantage.",
        "42... Qxh5 43. Rc1 Qf7 44. Qxe5": "I lose, reguardless of how impressive my other moves are. I decided to play it through, though.",
        "44... f4 45. Qh8+ Qg8 46. Rc8+": "White's winning move.",
        "46... Kf7 47. Qxg8+ Ke7 48. Qd8+ Kf7 49. Rc7+ Kg6 50. Qf8 Kg5": "No possible way out of mate.",
