    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "I start off with my usual.",
        "1... e5": "As does Tom.  Of course, this is going to become the Spanish Opening.  Just like with fiercequeen, this is my favorite as white.",
        "2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6": "Instead of retreating, I decided to exchange right away.  And, it wasn't just because I could exchange.  I like to hold off.  But, had I retreated with 4.Ba4 then would come something like 4...b5 5.Bb3, and after 5...Na5, I'm forced to exchange.  I'd rather exchange now then at that point.  That's because unlike the doubled pawns that Tom will wind up with, I don't want to allow doubled pawns on my side along the b file.  As that would be of an asset.  And, I didn't want to play 4.Bd3 as that blocks my center pawn.  In fact, I told my student, reachforgoals that it's not a good idea.  However, there's one move that I failed to consider.  So, instead of exchanging, I think that best would've been 4.Be2  As I also considered Bc4 and asked myself what would happen is Tom attacks 4...c6.  4.Bf1 also came into consideration, but I didn't want to undevelop my LSB which would make it difficult to castle.  So, had I given it a little more thought, 4.Be2 is what I would've played, instead.",
        "4... bxc6 5. Nc3": "Because Tom did not play the Berlin Defense, I, for the first time in a while, thought about tipsyjouneyman told me in the Ruy Lopez.  So, I decided to hold off on castling for one move by developing another piece.  This is a transposition of what I had considered and what's normally done.  As I usually play 5.0-0, followed by 6.Nc3, in this position.  But, the reverse happened here.",
        "5... Bd6": "Protecting his e5 pawn.  But, I was not about to take it because he would be able to answer with 5...Qe7 winning it back.  Afterwhich, despite it being even, black would have an advantage, as I learned from Coach Stockel.  That's similar to what you see in the Berlin Defense, after 4.0-0 Nxe5 5.Re1 which white wins back the pawn and gets the advantage, so it's the same idea.  ",
        "6. O-O": "As noted, this is what I had in mind after 5.Nc3 since this is a transposition of my general play here.",
        "6... Bb7": "Completing his development.",
        "7. d3": "I was very tempted to play 7.d4 but wanted to avoid falling into the Noah's Ark Trap.",
        "7... Nf6": "Meanwhile, Tom continues with his development.",
        "8. Bg5": "And, I pin that N.",
        "8... h6": "I had expected 8...Be7 as that's how I normally answer and would do it, were I playing as black.  But, Tom broke the pin this way.",
        "9. Be3": "Since I didn't feel a need, I refrain from exchanging.  Afterall, I'm keeping in mind the dream that I had and what GM Susan Polgar mentioned about when to exchange.  Now, if Tom was forced to recapture with the K, it would be a whole different story as we'd be talking about his K side pawn structure, but that's not the case here.  So, there would not be an immediate advantage to playing 9.Bxf6, instead.",
        "9... Ng4": "I don't see the point behind this move.  Mate is not threatened here.  Now, his Queen was on h4, and my N was not on f3, it would be a different story.  As 10.h3 would be forced.  But, I have nothing to worry about, in this position.  Thus, I ask the important of what Tom wants?  Sure enough, it's to exchange on e3.",
        "10. Bd2": "For the same reason that I noted with the pin, I refuse, just as Kenneth_fiore_3 refused to exchange in our first game and won that way.  It was after declining combined with the coaching why Tom wanted it.  He had to have felt pressure, and thus, exchanging would relieve that.  But, as Ken said during that game, \"The pressure stays on.\"",
        "10... Nxh2": "?? Thinking that this would take it away and, assuming there was Ghost Vision, he assumed that this would take care of the problem.  He probably thought that this was a piece here, with which, it's an even exchange.  But, he took a pawn.  So, by doing this, I am going to win the N, in return.",
        "11. Nxh2 a5": "Trying to mobilize his R.  It was more limited before, but now, it can move an extra square.  So, it's a semi open file.",
        "12. Qf3": "I ignore and try to put a bit of pressure against his K.  I start analyzing a line which I thought might be effective until later on.  But, it continues even with my next move.  I am, however, having a small amount of Tunnel Vision, but it's not quite enough to effect my play.",
        "12... Ba6 13. Ng4": "The whole idea behind this move, and 12.Qf3 was because it looked like white was threatening a checkmate.  But, that's where I figured out that it was Tunnel Vision because of where the N is now placed, in contrast to, where I thought it was placed.  So, hyperfocus right on the f7 square which is why it's Tunnel Vision.  As I thought that I might have a mating sequence.  This would, however, be true if the N were on g5, and he didn't have the pan h6.  So, in disguise, it was a good thing that this Tunnel Vision was there, as otherwise, he might have compensated, and even wound up the equivalent to a pawn up as this would have been a free N.  ",
        "13... Rb8": "Feeling some pressure and trying to compensate, Tom attacks b2.",
        "14. Rab1": "And, I defend.",
        "14... O-O": "Once he castles, that's when I start following through on my plan.",
        "15. Bxh6": "And, it's with this move.  Now, I had considered 15.Nxh6 with the same idea.  But, after 15...gxh6, 16.Bxh6 Re8, I don't know what white can do.  It looks like it, but there certainly isn't a mate.  That all came into consideration for which to take.  As this does work.  Unlike the previous variation, if black plays 15...gxh6, I have 16.Nxh6+ and mate would not be far off.  There are variations that would prevent it immediately, but checkmate would come sooner then later.",
        "15... Qh4": "However, the plan does not work, as Tom plays this to prevent that.",
        "16. Be3": "Which left my DSB en-prise for real.  So, I defend.",
        "16... Bb4": "Tom wants to exchange.",
        "17. g3": "But, trying to trick Tom into getting his Queen away from the h file, where a similar plan could work, I attack it.",
        "17... Qh7": "However, it does not work, as Tom keeps his Q on the h file.",
        "18. Nxe5": "Instead of exchanging, I take another pawn, and threaten a N fork against his Rooks.",
        "18... Rbd8": "Not surprisingly, Tom prevents the fork.",
        "19. Ne2": "Although I could allow liquidation since it benefits white, I refuse the exchange.  As I am thinking that my other N could work.  And, two together could produce an overwhelming amount of pressure against Tom's King.  The real question how.",
        "19... Bc8": "I don't think it was necessary as it wasn't en-prise, but Tom adds another defender to his d7 pawn.",
        "20. Nf4": "This is where I'm thinking that the second N could be useful against Tom's King.",
        "20... Bd6": "But, Tom attacks it.",
        "21. Ng4": "And, I defend.",
        "21... Bxf4": "This time, he forces an exchange, but I don't mind since it's also liquidation after remaining ahead.",
        "22. Bxf4 Bb7": "I am not exactly sure why Tom played this.  But, Jack Stockel now gets involved here.",
        "23. Be5": "Thinking that I might now have a mate with the N sac, I ignore c7 and play this.  But, Jack was right to get really angry.  Almost yelling, he said, \"Why didn't you play 23.Bxc7! wins the pawn?\" ",
        "23... d6": " I said that I don't really need that pawn because I have a different plan.  Jack said, \"I am interested in what your plan is.\"",
        "24. Nf6+": "This, was my plan.  It was being this sac against his K.  I thought that when Tom takes back, I had a checkmate but didn't look at the variations carefully enough.",
        "24... gxf6 25. Qg4+": "Similar to what happened when I gave the wrong to a student whose no longer on this website, unfortunately, I thought that Tom's only move 25...Kh8 which leads to checkmate.  26.Bxf6+ Qg7 27.Qxg7#  But, I forgot an important lesson that Ken emphasized.  And, it's also something that fiercequeen mentioned in her first annotation that I commented on which is to relook at my variations.",
        "25... Qg6": "As Tom interposed with his Q, instead.  That changes everything.  In part, I did not study this possibility.  Being very upset and for good reason, Jack said that I have now allowed Tom to equalize.  In fact, he said that with best play from both sides, Tom has a forced draw.  And, he might even be winning, whereas before, I was clearly winning.  Well, I don't think that white is lost, but I agree that best play will allow him to pull a swindle with a draw.",
        "26. Qxg6+": "After looking at it a little bit, I felt that exchanging was a way to fix my mistake.  Tom was doing a lot with his Queen, and the B was attacked.  I asked myself what to do here.  Perhaps there was something that I missed here, but I felt that exchanging helped to alleviate the problem that I caused for myself even though it means that he undoubled my pawns.  By this, I mean that I feel a little more comfortable about my position.  But, don't be fooled as I am less then satisfied, after the miscalculation.",
        "26... fxg6 27. Bc3": "So, I defended this way thinking that I might be a little better off then 27.Bf4 or 27.Bd4 where he can attack again and gain another tempo.  I'm also threatening to gain a pawn in a different way.  Of course, I'm aware that Tom can defend it.",
        "27... Kf7": "? But, Tom played this.  I'm not sure why, but I am back to being satisfied.  The reason being is that I missed the opportunity to win another before.  But, that is now back, and I take advantage of it by capturing.  Another reason for feeling almost happy is due to c7 being attacked.",
        "28. Bxa5 Rfh8": "? I don't know why Tom played this, but I win back the very pawn that I overlooked.  Remembering the oversight that I made the last time, I took it.  And, I am now a happy camper again.",
        "29. Bxc7": "As Jack acted upset by saying, \"So you let him win the pawn again.\"",
        "29... d5": "?? After this move, Jack said to Tom, \"White now has a won game.\"  Being just about out of time since it's about noon which is when I need to leave I said, I don't see how I can win.  He said, \"Take a moment and see if you can figure it out.\"  Well, due to it being a minute afterward combined with me having to go to work, I panicked a little.  But, I found just in the nick of time as Jack was finishing another game or watching somelse finish it.  I usually don't panick and know what to do, on a regular day.  But, regular isn't the case when you have to pack up and get ready for work.  The winning move, however, is what I play next. ",
        "30. Bxd8": "Jack said, \"That's right.\"  And, Tom resigned here, as now, he is too far behind.  Even if he answers with 30...Rxd8, I am now ahead by the equivalent to an entire Rook without compensation.  Moreover, it's an endgame which leaves black with a hopeless position."
