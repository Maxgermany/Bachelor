        "1. e4 c5": "Sicilian Defence is my favorite. Because of it I play 1.d4 - don't want to switch sides.",
        "2. Nf3 Nc6": "There are a lot of possibilities here. I usually prefer Nc6 because want to keep pressure on d4. It is not guarantee something - just I used to play like this. For example, I also prefer Nimzo-Indian Defence or Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence- always keep pressure on white position. ",
        "3. d4": "I am very happy when people play this variation. Bb5 and c3 are more boring.",
        "3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6": "Keeping pressure. ",
        "5. Nc3 e5": "I love this variation. ",
        "6. Nf3": "Usually white play Ndb5. \r\nTake a look on position. Whites spent three moves on jumping of knight. Only problem that blacks have is what to do with 'd' pawn. ",
        "6... Bb4": "Very annoying for whites. Need to do something to save e4 pawn.",
        "7. Bd3": "After that I already could hit on c3 and in the future put rock on c8 - pressure on c line is very powerful. ",
        "7... d5": "Basically almost all variations of Sicilian Defence for blacks is about putting pawn on d5:\r\n1. Pawn d is no longer weak - it can be exchanged or be annoying for whites.\r\n2. After exchanging pawn on e5 becomes very powerful - it is always a threat to move it on e4.\r\n3. After exchanging whites have no active pawns. ",
        "8. exd5 Nxd5": "Pressure on c3. Need to do something.",
        "9. Bd2 O-O 10. O-O Bxc3": "Blacks need to get something from their advantage. Doubled pawns will be enough.",
        "11. bxc3": "Maybe whites want to keep both bishops. They are very powerful but you need to put it on active positions. Now only bishop on d3 actually attack something. But it useless without support.",
        "11... Nf6": "On d5 knight is useless - c3 pawn is weak but covered and you need to think about new threats. Now it is all about e4.",
        "12. Bg5 Re8": "Again - blacks want put pawn on e4 no matter what.",
        "13. Re1 h6": "Bishop on g5 is annoying and I thought it is good to exchange it. If whites put it on h4 - at least blacks get h6 for free.",
        "14. Bxf6 Qxf6 15. h3": "Whites afraid of Bg4. ",
        "15... Bf5": "Bishop on d3 is strong - need to do something with it. But exchange on d3 is stupid - want to achieve the goal by keeping pressure on e4.",
        "16. Be4 Bxe4 17. Rxe4 Rad8": "Basically now rock is active for free - white queen on e2 is not much better than on d1.",
        "18. Qe2 Qe6": "Need to do something with blocking rock. f5 is only way to do it. Small bonus - pawn on a2 is under attack.",
        "19. Re1": "Take a look at position again - whites have only pressure on e5 pawn but all their forces is not enough. ",
        "19... f5 20. Rc4": "You need to put rock somewhere but here it is under attack. It means queen is not free. \r\nI counted on something like Nd4.",
        "20... Qf7": "Rock on the same line with opposite queen - it's always nice. Also rock on c4 and pawn on a2 is under attack.",
        "21. Ra4": "Admitting that previous move was a mistake. But it also useless. ",
        "21... a6": "Now knight is free to move and rock is still useless.",
        "22. Qc4 Rd5": "Maybe if it was live game I would think about exchanging and go to hte ending with advantage (line d, doubled pawns, weak white rocks). But it is not interesting. ",
        "23. Qb3": "Basically whites is right - they need some targets, otherwise - no chances. ",
        "23... Red8 24. Kh2 e4": "Finally. ",
        "25. Ng1 Qc7+": "If whites provide a possibility to regroup queen for free blacks should do it.",
        "26. Kh1 Na5": "Basically blacks need to do something about pin - for example, by moving the king. But in this case blacks can move knight on c4 where it is very active.",
        "27. Qb2": "I like this position - now every white chessman doing absolutely nothing.",
        "27... Rd5d2": "It is time to collect something. ",
        "28. Qb4": "Does not help.",
        "28... Rxf2 29. Qxa5 Qg3": "Oops. Game over.\r\n"
