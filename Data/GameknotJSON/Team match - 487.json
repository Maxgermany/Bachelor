        "5. dxe5": "Now black should counter with a pawn threat against the white bishop.  Pawn-pawn pushes the bishop off the black queen's diagonal.\n",

Ok, moments earlier black began mainlining heroin and imagined white's pawn had transmogrified into a knightly stallion.  How did black earn 1300 with moves like that?  Perhaps black's six year old nephew made this move while black was watching Dancing with the Stars.  Mm.  Black's e rook already prevented white's pawn from nabbing the bishop at f5.  I cannot discern any clear motive for Qe7.  With all white's firepower on the d rank black has little hope of a sudden checkmate with the queen sacrifice.  To add insult to injury that important central d5 pawn remains undefended.",
