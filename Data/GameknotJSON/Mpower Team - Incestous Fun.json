White can't castle king's side (Bb6 puts the king in check), but most folks would have gone with Pg4.  Black is kind of compelled to move the queen and cannot simply take the poisoned g pawn (now guarded by the white queen).",
        "13... Qg6 14. a5 Bc7 15. Ng3 d5 16. Ba2": "Bb3 would have given white's white bishop greater freedom of movement without constraining the a rook either.",
        "16... b6 17. O-O bxa5 18. bxa5 Bxa5 19. Ba3 Bb6+ 20. Kh1 Re8": "Here I would trade black bishop for knight--BxNe7.  Then Rf to B1.  The long term goal is RxBb6 (after the white bishop is moved).  Although protected by the pawn, black can't take it because then RxR.",

        "36... Rb8 37. Bc3": "I still liked BxPf4 better.  BxB, RxB, white comes out a pawn ahead.",
