        "1. e4": "This game, I played with the black pieces. My opponent was a rating-wise step-down from my earlier one. This game started with 1. e4, a particularly strong move for any level provided that they know what they're doing. The move occupies a center square and attacks another central square on Black's side. This pawn move also allows lines for the bishop and queen to move about the board. Statistically, it is the most commonly played move, but 1. d4 is more promising as it allegedly has a slightly better win/loss/draw ratio.",
        "1... e5": "This is my favorite counter to this move. As a King's Pawn Opening, both sides must play assertively, and there are many tricks involved in these openings. This move mirrors the previous move, and has the exact same motives. This is the second most played move according to the chessgames.com database.",
        "2. Nf3": "2. Nf3 is an excellent move for those beginning the game. It develops a piece, attacks two center squares, threatens my center pawn, and in some openings is hard to dislodge. This move is statistically significantly more played than other openings such as the Danish Gambit, the King's Gambit, the Vienna game, and the Scotch Game.",
        "2... Nc6": "Again, I mirror his move by moving a knight, but I have different motives this time. I reinforce two center squares, but in doing so I am reinforcing my attacked e-pawn. To many, this may not sound too breathtaking, but this principle of defense is often forgotten in many games including my own. This move also develops a back-rank piece and further creates a rook connection.",
        "3. Nc3": "This is the Three Knights Game. It is not very often played, but it is a perfectly valid opening. This move attempts to further solidify the center and prepare attacks such as d4 or continue easy development with moves like Bc4. Many people play moves like Bc4, Bb5, or d4 instead of this.",
        "3... Nf6": "This is the Four Knights Game. Bc5 and Bb4 are perfectly valid, but I prefer to keep the game quiet in positions such as this, so I like the Four Knights Game. At this point, our positions are mirrored, so we have equal chances of play, that is assuming that White does not always have a subtle advantage by being able to move first.",
        "4. Bb5": "This is a standard move. Instead of 4. Bc4 which attacks the f7 pawn, White wants to threaten the guard of the e5-pawn. This move may or may not harass the player, but it is still a sound move.",
        "4... d6": "This is not the best move. I gift my opponent with a pin on my knight and king and I block my f8 bishop from movement. Although I never study openings, now that I think of it, Bc5 or Bb4 seem like better alternatives to my clumsy move. I favor the Hungarian Defense, so this position doesn't appall me as much as it might to the next guy, but in every game, I wish that my bishop could ever get to c5.",
        "5. Bxc6+": "This is not a very impressive move as it removes a bishop which could have a great role in the game in exchange for a knight that was already pinned in. Black may get doubled pawns and a d6-pawn that cannot move without help, but White loses the two-bishop advantage. I don't think so much of this, but it sincerely does help to have two bishops on the board especially when a piece was just traded off; this means that there will be a more open position, positions that two bishops dominate with.",
        "5... bxc6": "This was a simple recapture I get a chance to play Ba6, but this is stopped via the opponent's next move.",
        "6. d3": "This move frees a line for the bishop to generate a pin on my knight and queen, defends the pawn on e4, and this leaves room for the c3-knight to go elsewhere. An interesting move would have been 6. d4, but this seems like it would go better for me.",
        "6... Bg4": "I develop my bishop to pin the knight and queen of the enemy. 6. ...Ba6 does not work even if the c3-knight were absent because after 7. O-O Nxe5 8. dxe5 Bxf1 9. Kxf1, I have lost two minor pieces for a rook and pawn, which is arguably worse for me.",
        "7. Bg5": "Just as I thought, my opponent develops a piece and pins my knight and queen. In addition, White is almost ready to make a king-side attack. This did not pique my interest, however.",
        "7... Be7": "I make a classic Hungarian Defense-style bishop. It is not an ideal bishop to have, but now I get room to castle on the king-side, and I destroy his pin on my pieces.",
        "8. Bxf6": "Obsessed with trading? Now I have the clear two bishops advantage in an ever-opening position. His bishop could have done something at e3, but my knight would have a difficult time finding a worthwhile outpost.",
        "8... Bxf6": "I was behooved to recapture with the g-pawn in order to make a line for my rook, but if something were to happen to my central pawn structure, that could prove quite troublesome. Besides, I have two bishops, and I don't want to keep them clustered between my pawns. I also get space for my queen to move this way.",
        "9. O-O": "White wants to get his king safe in order to start that assault I mentioned way earlier. 9. h3, repelling my bishop, would have also been interesting.",
        "9... O-O": "Once again, I mirror his castle. With my move, I get my king safe, and with my f6-bishop out of the way, I can push with f5. The only drawback to this is that now White can play 10. h3 Bh5 11. g4, which pushes my bishops to an uncomfortable, closed area where his knights can cause damage. In other words, I believe that my move was an inaccuracy.",
        "10. Qd2": "After this move I saw opportunity to make a winning game. White does relieve himself from a pin, but his queen has nowhere to go. Also, the only piece protecting his knight now is a king-side pawn. A better move would have been 10. h3 to push my bishop back and continue the attack that way.",
        "10... Bxf3": "As aforementioned, I envisioned opportunity after my opponents play. I didn't need two bishops because I got a way to directly assault his king.",
        "11. gxf3": "This was the only logical move to regain material. Any other move would have resulted in loss of a minor piece, which is usually fair grounds to resign if you are not a fight-to-the-death player.",
        "11... d5": "I played this move because I thought I had the opportunity to get the center, but looking back, I should have played 11. ...Bg5 to attack the queen and later play Bf4. 11. ...g5 was a mistake in my opinion.",
        "12. Rae1": "Speaking of mistakes, this move was a mistake as well. This gave me another chance to play the move mentioned earlier. I would think that 12. f4 would have been better.",
        "12... Bg5": "With this move I get a tempo to play Bf4. My intentions with that is to go for a checkmate. In this game, I didn't wish that my bishop was on c5.",
        "13. Qd1": "This is the best move in my opinion. 13. Qe2 would have surely lead to a Mate in 5 or loss of material. This way, White can play Ne2 as a countermeasure.",
        "13... Bf4": "Here I am continuing with my plan. There is not much White can do here except for 14. Ne2. Even with that, I lock up the position in the center with a move such as 14. ...d4 or better.",
        "14. Na4": "I think that White did not see 14. Ne2 and assumed defeat. this move only moves the knight to a rim. c4 does not do much except block the position with my d4 the following move.",
        "14... Qh4": "I moved my queen to this square to checkmate on h2. 14. ...Qg5+ would have delayed this by a move.",
        "15. h3": "This is the only move that delays the inevitable checkmate. I would have done the same thing here.",
        "15... Qxh3": "I capture the pawn. I know that from this point there is no stopping the game from ending.",
        "16. Re3": "Probably an attempt to fool me into capturing the rook. I would have done the same thing, or even sacrifice my queen.",
        "16... Qh2#": "And that's the game. It turns out that the two bishops advantage really does help. From this annotation, beginners can learn how to utilize pins, and advanced players enjoyed an interesting game played by a lower level. Thanks for your time, and I hope that you enjoyed my annotation!"
