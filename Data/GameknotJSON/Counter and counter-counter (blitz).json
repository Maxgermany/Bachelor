        "5... O-O 6. g4 h6": "Weakening, but not enough to attack directly. ",
        "7. c3": "I will win the fight for e4, so I want to make space for my queen in c2 but without creating countergame. ",
        "7... Nbd7 8. Qc2 c6": "Black is still passive. ",
        "9. e4 dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxe4 11. Qxe4 Nf6 12. Qc2": "Ok, I lost a tempo with my queen, but I have the center. ",
        "12... b5 13. a3": "No, you won't pass so easily. ",
        "13... Qd5": "Good.",
        "14. Bg2": "Maybe the best would have been Qe2, but I thought that Nh4 was always possible. ",
        "14... Ne4": "Nice. Black has an edge, now. ",
        "15. Nd2": "I thought to be clever, now. This little tactics was nice to see on a blitz. ",
        "15... f5 16. gxf5": "I take, since he has now to retake with the pawn (or lose the N), so it uncovers his king. ",
        "16... gxf5": "I will win the exchange, right?",
        "17. Nxe4 fxe4 18. Bxe4": "Besides, this x-ray threatens c6. ",
        "18... Qh5": "Gives away c6, but prevents me from castling... annoying. And, of course, my dsb has become vulnerable. ",
        "19. Be3": "Trying to solidify and to keep an eye on h6. But this was probably bad. It doesn't look that bad, but...",
        "19... Bf5": "Preventing me to take c6... but forgiving a little tactic.",

        "22. Bg2": "Well, h3 was threatened, you see. ",
        "22... Bd3": "A giant \"hole\" on my light squares. ",
        "23. f3": "This was a blunder, because now Rxf3 wins: BxR, QxB, Kd2 (if Qd1, QxBe3+), Qe2+, Kc1, QxB... but black didn't trust on it.  ",
        "23... e5": "But this is not bad either. Incredibly enough, white, with +2, is beginning to suffer a lot, and the open black king is not easily attackeable. ",
        "24. Qd1 Bc4 25. Kd2": "Trying a \"surprise\" artificial casting. ",
        "25... exd4 26. Bxd4 Rbd8": "I thought that after the exchange, I'll have Kc3 to defend d4. But black was more poisoned.",
        "27. Kc2 Qg6+ 28. Kc1": "My extra bishop being closed as it is, and the rook prisioner of a1, I'm the one who has less pieces on the field1. And, after QxB, this will be even worse!",
        "28... Rfe8 29. b3": "Last attempt to give the king some squares. ",
        "29... Qg5+ 30. Kb2 Be2 31. Qc2": "Blunder. The only move was protect the bishop, with Qg1. But it was veeeery ugly, it must be said. ",
        "31... Rdc8": "Threatening BxB. ",
        "32. Bxg7+ Kxg7 33. Rhg1": "Well, at least some countertactic for me... I need one!",

        "34. Bf1+": "This can't be bad... but it is, in fact. ",
        "34... Kh8 35. Bxe2 Rxc3": "!! Of course, now the queen cannot retake, or RxB+, losing the queen!",
        "36. Qg6": "Hoping for a discovered attack, a queen`s exchange... just dreams. ",
