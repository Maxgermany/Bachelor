    "moves": {
        "1. d4": "I usually swear by e4, but every once in a while you need to try something out of the ordinary...",
        "1... d5": "I recommended this: variations with Nf6, g6, Bg7, 0-0, are way too complicated for this apprentice...",
        "2. c4": "Queens' Pawn Gambit: the only feasable way after this...",
        "2... e6": "a sound move: White has to reckon with Bb4...",
        "3. Nf3": "this move serves multiple purposes: the most important being Bg5...",
        "3... Nf6": "so this move makes sense...",
        "4. Bf4": "after Bg5, Be7, there is nothing: so White just prepares e3, releasing Bf1...",
        "4... Nc6 5. a3": "prophylactic: we do not need interference on b4...",
        "5... Be7 6. e3 O-O 7. Bd3 dxc4": "costing White an extra tempo, in developing the LSB...",
        "8. Bxc4 b6 9. b4 Bb7 10. Nc3 a6": "against Nb5...",
        "11. O-O Na7": "releasing pawn c7, while making Bb7 active: not bad at all...",
        "12. Re1": "supporting an upcoming e4...",
        "12... b5": "trying to throw White out of balance: but this might backfire...",
        "13. Bd3 Bd5": "maybe asking too much...",
        "14. e4 Bc4 15. Bxc4 bxc4 16. h3 Nh5 17. Be3": "a mutual change of scenery...",
        "17... c6": "preparing Qc7...",
        "18. Qc2 Qc7": "both players have completed development: as usual, White is one tempo ahead...",
        "19. e5": "again, prophylactic: White needs to ponder over security for the King, before going to battle...",
        "19... Nb5": "looking for play: after Nxb5, cxb5, Blacks' position is in order...",
        "20. Rec1": "which is exactly, why White does not comply: now, after Nxc3, Qxc3, White gets out better...",
        "20... Rac8": "this makes sense: copying the battery of Queen and rook...",
        "21. a4": "but here might be a problem: the Knight can no longer cover for the Queen, if or when things get rough...",
        "21... Na7": "Nxc3, Qxc3, gives little hope for the future...",
        "22. g4": "time to give the forgotten Knight on the rim some attention...",
        "22... f6": "I have to admit: this is a very strong reply, given the circumstances; after just gxh5, fxe5, we reach a totally different ball park: without coverage for Nf3, White might lose valuable tempo; and exf6, Nxf6 solves all problems for Black...",
        "23. Qe2": "I seriously looked at gxh5, fxe5, Nxe5, but after Bh4, I encountered too many problems: White has to reckon with g5! also; so covering for Nf3 seemed very wise: Nh5 is still very much outplayed...",
        "23... Ng3 24. fxg3 fxe5 25. Nxe5": "probably the best way for Black, to lose this piece...",
        "25... Bxb4 26. Qxc4 Qd6": "forced: Black has to cover Bb4 as well as d6...",
        "27. Qxa6": "only to lose a pawn, in the process...",
        "27... Rca8": "the only way, to cover for Na7...",
        "28. Ne4": "blowing up, Blacks' position...",
        "28... Qd5": "again, Black produces a very creative solution: now, White has no time to take on c6; first Ne4 needs attention: also Na7 is a very dangerous piece, when it decides something like Nb5 followed by Nxd4...",
        "29. Nc5": "practically forced: luckily, Qf3 is prohibited by Ne5...",
        "29... Bxc5": "here, Nb5 is no longer an option: Qxc6 solves all; so Black decides to try and break up the center...",
        "30. Rxc5": "again forced...",
        "30... Qe4": "again a very smart move indeed: White has to react, and postpone any attacking plans...",
        "31. Qd3": "time to put this pesky Queen to rest...",
        "31... Qxd3": "only move...",
        "32. Nxd3 Rac8": "something needs to be done about c6: this is a logical move...",
        "33. Ne5 Rc7": "avoiding Nd7...",
        "34. Rb1": "taking Nb5 out of the equation...",
        "34... Rfc8": "Black has secured all, so it seems...",
        "35. Rb6": "but there are no moves left...",
        "35... h6": "it is hard to find moves for Black: since Ng6 is no real threat, this is probably best...",
        "36. Nc4": "but White has different plans...",
        "36... Rd7": "the right rook: after Rcd8, Bf4 might lead to trouble...",
        "37. Bf4": "nonetheless...",
        "37... Rxd4": "after something like Nd6 or Bd6, Blacks position is locked up forever: so he needs to react...",
        "38. Rb7": "but White is preparing a mate attack on pawn f7...",
        "38... Ra8": "pawn c6 is no longer an issue, and Nb5 is no longer an option: so this is the only one...",
        "39. Be5": "time to work on mating...",
        "39... Rd1+": "the only way out...",
        "40. Kf2 Nc8": "finally releasing the Knight, with an attack on a4...",
        "41. Rxg7+": "but White is first...",
        "41... Kf8": "the only one: after Kh8, just Rd7+ or Ra7+, losing a rook...",
        "42. a5": "no worries yet: White has time on her side...",
        "42... Ne7": "again, c6 needs to be covered: but this will backfire...",
        "43. Rh7": "Bf6 (Bd6 will lose Rg7) fails on Ra7: but this threatens Rh8+ and loss of Ra8...",
        "43... Ra7": "only this will help, also aiding in covering Ne7...",
        "44. Bd6": "time to pick up the pieces...",
        "44... Rd7": "considering the circumstances, a decent move...",
        "45. Bxe7+": "White has no tricks left, so we wrap this up...",
        "45... Rxe7": "no point in avoiding this...",
        "46. Rxe7 Kxe7 47. Rxc6": "and finally, c6 has fallen: time for Black to resign, which he luckily did..."
