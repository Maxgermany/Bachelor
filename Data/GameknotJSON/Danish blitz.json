        "5... d6 6. Qd5": "? Probably not very good, but I was trying to put pressure on him and it was blitz. But this was bad as it allowed him to develop with tempo.",
        "6... Be6 7. Qb5+": "? I don't think this is great.",
        "7... Nc6": "? Tempting to develop, but I think Pc6 would be better.",
        "8. Nf3 Be7 9. Nbd2 Nf6 10. e5": "Trying to squeeze him a little.",
        "10... dxe5 11. Bxe6 fxe6": "Look at his poor, isolated, doubled, e pawns, easy to pick off.",
        "12. Nxe5 O-O": "? Loses a pawn...",
        "13. Nxc6": "! To this",
        "13... bxc6 14. Qxc6": "His position is in tatters. While he is still up a pawn, he has *four* different pawn islands, and three isolated pawns. White, has two pawn islands and one isolated pawn. White is also more active.",
        "14... Bb4 15. Rd1 Bxd2+": "? Here he played what I hoped he'd do.",
        "16. Rxd2 Qc8 17. Qf3": "I look for a way to pick off a pawn.",
        "17... Qe8": "He's shuffling his pieces around the back row.",
        "18. O-O": "Gets my other rook involved.",
        "18... Qa4 19. Qe3": "Threatens e6 and also lays a little trap...",
        "19... Qxa2": "?? Looks tempting doesn't it, a free pawn and defending your pawn at the same time sounds pretty good right?",
        "20. Bxf6": "!",
        "20... Qa5 21. Qxe6+": "He does not have long to live.",
        "21... Rf7 22. Rd7": "I pile up on the pinned rook.",
