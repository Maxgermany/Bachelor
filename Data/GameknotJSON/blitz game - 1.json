    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. c4": "Transforming it into an english-like opening. Weakeness the center though, which is oppossite to the idea of the sicilian closed variation; it also provides black with an extra move to arm his defenses, but sometimes I like to play this plan.",
        "2... Nc6 3. Nc3 d6 4. d3 g6 5. g3 Bg7 6. Bg2 Nf6 7. Nge2 O-O 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3": "It seems to weaken the castling, but white\u00b4s only attack plan resides in moving his king\u00b4s flank against black\u00b4s castling.",
        "9... Bd7 10. f4 Nh5": "Gives white a free move",
        "11. g4 Nf6 12. Be3": "Aiming for Black\u00b4s castling and also pinning c5. Maybe f5 was a stronger move, threatening 13.g5 in case of 12...e6.",
        "12... e6 13. Qd2 Qc7": "Protecting b2 and also indirectly c5. Also 14.Ng3 with the idea of supporting the attack in f5 (15.f5) is not that good anymore considering now 15...d5.",
        "14. f5 exf5 15. gxf5": "Opening the g-column for the rook (in a future possibility). Maybe exf5 was better since it activates white\u00b4s bishop, but it did not seem clear to me.",
        "15... a6": "Trying some sort of counterattack. Maybe Nh5 was stronger, but it is difficult to find a precise defense in such a blitz game",
        "16. Bh6 Ne5 17. Bxg7 Kxg7 18. Qg5": "Putting some pressure on f6. I knew I was giving up on d3, but it seemed to me there was compensation, although I had not a winning line at hand. I still can\u00b4t find it.",
        "18... Qd8": "Not accepting the sacrifice but allows me to add the Ne2 to the attack while defending d3 at the same time. Still, h6 seemed better.",
        "19. Nf4 h6 20. Qg3 g5 21. Ncd5": "Spent most of my time thinking here what to do, and didn\u00b4t find anything better. I was eager to get a winning attack. 21. h4, Nh7 doesn\u00b4t seem to help me much.",
        "21... Bc6": "Now this seemed to be the wrong one here in the game. Still 21...Nh7 looked good to me, with the idea of f6, closing the case.",
        "22. Nxf6 Kxf6": "Cannot be taken with queen, thus, black\u00b4s King is on the move for awhile",
        "23. Nh5+ Ke7 24. f6+": "Impeding f6 and also constricting black\u00b4s space. On the other hand, although N in h5 seems to be a good defender, holding that wing, it lacks attacking performance.",
        "24... Kd7 25. Bf3": "Trying to activate my bishop. Maybe d4 with the idea of placing my rooks on the attack in d column was better. Nxf3 doesn\u00b4t seem to be a good option, since it will remove black\u00b4s active N.",
        "25... Kc7": "Now it seems clear white needs to attack on the queen\u00b4s side. White\u00b4s N in h5 seems even less useful now, but white rooks are more appealing than those of black\u00b4s",
        "26. Bg4": "Maybe a waste of time, maybe not.",
        "26... Bd7 27. a3": "Here we go. Black now needs to place his rooks on the defense, including that on f8 that seems to be extremely passive.",
        "27... Qc8": "Threatening Bxg4 and gaining a pawn",
        "28. Bf5 Ng6": "Doesn\u00b4t seem to be the best defense, as mentioned, Black needs to prepare the defense on the queen side of the board.",
        "29. b4 b6 30. d4": "I was preparing this move (as mentioned previously) way ahead of this position, but now N in g6 makes it even easier.",
        "30... Nf4": "Blocks white\u00b4s queen g3-d6 control and also opens g column for a counterattack. Also, after 31.Nxf4 gxf4; 32.Qxf4, Bxf5, white pawns in f column doesn\u00b4t seem to compensate that extra pawn. But In that case, I was thinking about: 33.d (or b)xc5! threatening mate in two (or else losing rook in f8 after white check on d6.",
        "31. Nxf4 gxf4 32. Qxf4 Rg8+ 33. Kh2 Bxf5 34. dxc5": "And so it went, although now rook cannot be taken. Still not sure if black can compensate after 34...Bd7 since white\u00b4s rooks seem to be extremely active. It would have been interesting to follow that line. In these few minutes of light analysis I can\u00b4t find a clear winning line, with, for example, 34...Bd7; 35.Qxd6+, Kd8 and careful now; there is always the possibility of ...Qb8 or Qc7 to exchange queens or even threatening mate. So, 36. Qe7+, Kc7; 37.cxb6+ Kxb6 cannot be continued with Qxf7 because of 38...Qc7+ and 39...Qg3 etc.",
        "34... bxc5": "Opening the b-column. Now white\u00b4s attack cannot be stopped with Bd7",
        "35. bxc5": "Black surrenders.\n\n I still have the feeling that white had a better attack before, but I couldn\u00b4t find a better line, so it is up to you guys to resolve the middle game resolution."
