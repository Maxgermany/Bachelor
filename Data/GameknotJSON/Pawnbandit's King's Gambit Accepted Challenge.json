        "1. e4": "This game is from another King's Gambit Accepted tournament I joined. In this game I had the black pieces.",
        "1... e5 2. f4 exf4": "This is the position the games were started in. White to move.",
        "3. Bc4": "A very strange looking move. I believe it to be a bad move. I've talked to my opponent about this particular move after the game. He believes it's OK.",
        "3... Qh4+": "It can be dangerous to move the Queen out just three moves into the game. But in this position I believe it to be alright. White can play 3 things. I think them all to be bad. ",
        "4. Kf1": "This would be the best of the moves. It can be ok though. White can play Nf3 kicking out the Queen and moving Kf6 followed by Rf1 or Rf2.",
        "4... g5": "Now my obvious idea is to rush a King side attack.",
        "5. Nc3": "Maybe white could still have play Nf3.",
        "5... g4": "Stopping the Knight to get where it should be.",
        "6. d4": "Good move. Attack the f pawn while gaining center control.",
        "6... Nf6": "I blundered here. I could have played Bh6.",
        "7. g3": "I think white should have taken the pawn. I don't see the logic in this move.",
        "7... fxg3": "Maybe to double my pawns. That's fine for black. ",
        "8. Kg2": "Making is possible to play hxg3.",
        "8... Nh5": "Moving the Knight twice. Maybe black had a better move? Push a pawn or develop the dark squared Bishop.",
        "9. Nd5": "Threatening Nc7  winning the rook. Black can't play Bd6 or Na6 to guard the c7 square. If Bd7 then e5. If Na6 then Bxa6.",
        "9... Kd8": "Obvious. ",
        "10. Qe1": "Good move. Pinning the g3 pawn as well as threatening to play Qa5.",
        "10... c6": "At this point I noticed a rook fork for white. And this doesn't prevent it.",
        "11. Nc7 Kxc7 12. Qa5+ b6 13. Qe5+": "There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.",
        "13... Bd6": "Now black has its dark squared bishop right where it should be.",
        "14. Qxh8": "The Queen is now out of the game. For good",
        "14... gxh2": "White can't take back.",
        "15. e5": "Good defensive move from white. But it gives black the tempo back.",
        "15... Qg3+ 16. Kf1": "This was forced.",
        "16... Bb4": "Moving the bishop to safety. Threatening Be1 followed by Qf2#.",
        "17. c3": "This stops black temporarily. If at all. ",
        "17... hxg1=Q+ 18. Rxg1 Qf3+ 19. Ke1": "Forced.",
        "19... g3": "Threatening to win back the Rook. Notice the white Queen hasn't had a chance to jump back into the game. And black has won the exchange for the black Rook.",
        "20. Rf1 Bxc3+": "Now threatening the Rook on a1. \n21. bxc3    Qxb3 \n22. Bd2     Qxa1",
        "21. Bd2": "Much worse than losing the rook, white has just lost the game.",
        "21... Qe3+": "It is forced from here.",
        "22. Kd1": "White could have also played Be2. The result wold have been the same.",
        "22... Qxd2#": "THE END. \nGOOD GAME  "
