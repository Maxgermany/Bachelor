    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "Mike Stoddart had been undefeated in the Wirral League up to this point",
        "1... b6": "A slightly unusual reply, although you will find it in one of my other annotations.",
        "2. d4": "So I grab the centre",
        "2... Bb7": "He hits my e pawn",
        "3. Bd3": "I protect it, hoping for 3....f5 (see previous annotation)",
        "3... e6": "He doesn't fall for that!",
        "4. Be3": "I continue to develop",
        "4... Bb4+": "This is a dreaful waste of time. It is not in either opening database on Gameknot, and for good reason. It more or less forces c3 which is a move that white wants to play anyway.",
        "5. c3": "So I play the natural",
        "5... Be7": "He retreats",
        "6. Nd2": "I develop",
        "6... Nf6": "He develops",
        "7. g4": "I hit him with an aggressive thrust, hoping to drive his knight back. He avoids this, but at the cost of blocking in his Bb7",
        "7... d5": "This gives his knight a square on e4, but at an enormous cost - blocking in his best placed piece on b7.",
        "8. e5": "So I push on",
        "8... Ne4": "and he jumps in. N(f)-d7 is probably best, but still worse for black.",
        "9. Qc2": "I thought after making that move, that I could have improved with Nf1 threatening f3 and if he replies Ng5 I have h4 and his knight has nowhere safe to go. However later I realised that f3 can be met with Bh4+ and then Ng5 and I can't play h4. If I try to play Qc2 and 0-0-0 first, he can still play Bh4 at some point to frustrate my plans, or play c5 followed by exchanging on d5. So I don't think Nf1 is any good and what i played is probably best. I am threatening to exchange on e4 and win a pawn, so he exchanges first.",
        "9... Nxd2": "He takes",
        "10. Bxd2": "I take",
        "10... Bg5": "He seeks exchanges, as his position is cramped.",
        "11. f4": "I prevent that, although Nf3 or 0-0-0 may have been stronger. I was playing for the win!",
        "11... Bh4+": "He throws in a check",
        "12. Ke2": "My king is perfectly safe here, while the centre is closed.",
        "12... h6": "I was threatening to capture on h7. I end up with 3 pawns for the bishop, but the f and g pawns are already advanced.",
        "13. Nf3": "So I develop. He needs to retreat his bishop now, I am threatening to win it.",
        "13... Nd7": "But he just develops again.",
        "14. Rag1": "Once again, I put my trust in development. immediate attack with g5 or f5 may have been better. I thought my threat was pretty obvious now,",
        "14... Qe7": "But he didn't seem to spot it! Be7 or counter attack with c5 is probably his best bet.",
        "15. g5": "His bishop on h4 is in grave danger now.",
        "15... hxg5": "So he takes",
        "16. fxg5": "I take back",
        "16... O-O-O": "He could have confused the issue with f5, instead he just lets me carry on my plan",
        "17. Rg4": "He is just losing a bishop for nothing now.",
        "17... Bxg5": "So he may as well have a pawn for it.",
        "18. Bxg5": "Out of the three pieces which could have taken it, my bishop was the least active.",
        "18... f6": "So he hits my bishop",
        "19. Bf4": "I retreat",
        "19... g5": "He hits it again",
        "20. exf6": "Instead of retreating, I hit his queen.",
        "20... Nxf6": "He takes back",
        "21. Bxg5": "I pin his knight",
        "21... Qg7": "He releases the pin. I am a clear bishop up now.",
        "22. Bxf6": "So I may as well exchange",
        "22... Qxf6": "He takes back",
        "23. Qd2": "I move my queen to a more active square",
        "23... Rdf8": "He threatens QxNf3",
        "24. Qe3": "So I protect",
        "24... Rh3": "He threatens it again",
        "25. Rg3": "I protect",
        "25... Rfh8": "He is now threatening Rxg3 and I can't take back without losing my Rh1",
        "26. Qg5": "I offer an exchange of queens, usually a wise move if you are materially ahead.",
        "26... Qf7": "So he avoids this for the time being.",
        "27. Rhg1": "Mobilising my last piece, and threatening to exchange on h3 and follow with Qg8+",
        "27... Rh3h5": "So he retreats",
        "28. Qe3": "I retreat, emphasising my control of the g file",
        "28... Bc6": "Try to get his dreadful bishop back into the game.",
        "29. Rg3g7": "So I hit his queen.",
        "29... Qf6": "This drops another pawn, but the position is lost.",
        "30. Rg7g6": "Hitting his queen again.",
        "30... Qf7": "Queen retreats",
        "31. h4": "I should have just taken the e pawn",
        "31... Rf8": "Not quite sure why he played this",
        "32. Qxe6+": "So I take a pawn and force the queens off.",
        "32... Qxe6+": "He takes",
        "33. Rxe6": "I take back",
        "33... Bd7": "He hits my rook",
        "34. Re7": "I grab the 7th rank",
        "34... Kd8": "King comes across",
        "35. Rgg7": "and I secure the 7th rank. With my dominance of the 7th rank, he is losing his c pawn, unless he plays Re8 forcing further exchanges. He resigned here. Many thanks for reading my annotation, please leave a comment or two and rate the annotation on the star system."
