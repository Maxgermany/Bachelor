        "1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Bb4": "This is Black's most dynamic defense (attack!?) and the prime reason for the popularity of Tarrasch's 3. Nd2.  ",
        "4. a3": "This move can lead to a sharp system once championed by Alekhine, Smyslov and Bobby Fischer.",
        "4... Ba5": "This gives White a superior game.  Black will never have enough time to force e5.",
        "5. b4 Bb6 6. e5 Nc6 7. Nf3 a5 8. b5": "And as you can see, Black's pieces are a tangled mess with very little prospects of anything positive.",
        "8... Nce7 9. Na4 Bd7 10. Nxb6 cxb6 11. Bd3": "I already consider this a win for White.",
        "11... Qc7 12. O-O a4 13. Bd2 Rc8 14. Rb1 f6 15. Rc1 Ra8 16. c4 dxc4 17. Bxc4 Qd8 18. Re1 Kf7 19. Qe2 Ng6 20. d5": "I've been a bit confused by Black's play.  He certainly has no plan and is just floating around and I just want to end the game and move on.",
        "20... f5 21. dxe6+ Bxe6 22. Ng5+": "I'm convinced that Black just isn't paying attention to the position anymore.  If he feels that he has lost the game, he should resign.  If he thinks he still has a chance, he needs glasses."
