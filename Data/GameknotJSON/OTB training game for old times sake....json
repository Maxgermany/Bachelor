        "2. f4": "I am not the kind of player, that strives for d4 and contest c5: quite the contrary...",
        "2... g6": "preparing Bg7, furthermore discouraging d4...",
        "3. Nf3 Bg7 4. g3": "also d3 was possible: but White wants to keep the LSB diagonal open for now...",
        "4... e6": "serving multiple purposes: mostly preparing Ne7 and d5...",
        "5. c3": "a prophylactic move, against Nb8-c6-b4/d4: White has to wait, how Black responds...",
        "5... Ne7": "Nf6, might have induced e5: I would have played d3...",
        "6. Bg2": "Black has prepared castling: White has to keep up...",
        "6... O-O 7. O-O d6": "a direct d5 is useless: e5 and d3, are both sound replies...",
        "8. d3": "also for White, d4 is of little use: it is too early, for opening up the position...",
        "8... b6": "preparing Bb7: supporting an eventual d5...",
        "9. Be3": "while this might support an upcoming d4...",
        "9... Bb7 10. Nbd2 Nd7": "not unclever: supporting c5 and covering square e5...",
        "11. Qc2": "not really a plan involved: we are finishing development...",
        "11... Qc7": "and so does Black...",
        "12. a4": "first things first: keep b5 under control for a while; the Sicilian is all about pushing forward Black Queens' wing...",
        "12... Rac8": "thematic in most Sicilian play: upon breaking up the center, the Queen has to be covered...",
        "13. Rfc1": "same shit, different smell: White is also preparing b4 and d4...",
        "13... a6 14. b3": "waiting moves...",
        "14... Nf6": "seemingly an attack on pawn e4, after d5: and e4-e5, is no threat anymore; but the real threat is Ng4; at least, that is what Black thinks...",
        "15. Ra2": "the final preparation for b4: covering the White Queen twice; but Black is too occupied...",
        "15... Ng4 16. Bf2": "simple, yet very effective: the DSB has run its' course, and can be traded...",
        "16... Nxf2": "practically forced: h3 is not far away...",
        "17. Kxf2": "the old White man comes into play...",
        "17... Rfd8": "not sure, if this is best: Black might have tried e5...",
        "18. b4 c4": "maybe best: after cxb4, cxb4, Qxb2, Rxb2, Black has little to hope for...",
        "19. d4": "and thus, White has conquered the center...",
        "19... f5": "an old fox, never loses his tricks: exf5, Nxf5, would be very pleasant for Black; and e4 is attacked twice...",
        "20. e5": "I also looked at Ng5 to cover for e4, with Nxe6 as a prospect: but after Qd7, the Knight gets lost after Bf6 or h6...",
        "20... dxe5 21. fxe5": "relentless...",
        "21... Bh6": "avoiding Ng5, and pinning Nd2...",
        "22. Rd1": "problem solved: this is also supporting d4...",
        "22... Nd5": "threatening mayhem on e3...",
        "23. Nf1": "problem solved for now...",
        "23... Rdf8": "this is maybe, why Rf8 should have stayed put: Black wants to prepare f4...",
        "24. Re1": "time to end this...",
        "24... f4 25. g4": "a nasty surprise for Black...",
        "25... Ne3": "but there is no way back...",
        "26. Nxe3 fxe3+ 27. Rxe3": "Nf3 has to be covered twice: so this is pretty much forced...",
        "27... Bxe3+ 28. Kxe3": "also forced",
        "28... Qf7 29. Qf2 Bxf3": "suddenly, Ng5 is a nasty threat: the White Queen is covered twice...",
        "30. Bxf3 Qf4+ 31. Ke2 Qc1": "getting careless...",
        "32. Qe3": "the Black Queen is trapped...",
        "32... Qxe3+": "Black might have tried Qb1: but after Rd2, Qxa4, Bb7, Black is faced with all kinds of problems...",
        "33. Kxe3": "White has reached a position with roughly one pawn behind: but way more space and play; both Black Rooks are useless for now...",
        "33... Rc7": "a logical move: prevent Bb7, and prepare doubling Rooks...",
        "34. h4": "White takes up as much space as possible, before the shit hits the fan...",
        "34... Rcf7 35. Rf2": "so far, Black has no real grip on the White position: there are no straight winning chances for both; so he decides to equalize...",
        "35... Rf7xf3+ 36. Rxf3 Rxf3+ 37. Kxf3": "only to realize, he equalized into a lost position...",
