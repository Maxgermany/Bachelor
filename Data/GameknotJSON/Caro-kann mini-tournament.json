        "1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5": "The opening set up of a themed mini tournament.",
        "3. e5": "I decided on the advance variation, hoping to limit the mobility of black's Ng8.",
        "3... Bf5 4. Bd3": "Hoping to exchange light squared bishops with developing momentum.",
        "4... Bxd3 5. Qxd3": "Accomplished.......",
        "5... e6 6. Ne2 Qb6": "This move surprised me....I'm always a little scared when stronger players bring their queen out in front of their pawn chain. My dark bishop is now tied down....",
        "7. O-O Nd7 8. b3": "Attempting to free the dark squared bishop.",
        "8... c5": "Black starts swinging. If I take, he has three options to re-take. I don't want to allow Bxf5 with developing tempo. So,.......\r\n",
        "9. c4": "I swing right back at him, creating numerous potential complications. I'm hoping this creation of some space will render me at least even after the captures that surely will take place.",
        "9... cxd4 10. f4": "Risky, to say the least. My e pawn must be protected, but I've allowed a potential disaster by opening my king up to an attack from black's queen. At this point I don't know what's more important - regaining the pawn I've lost or completing development.",
        "10... dxc4": "Pressing the pawn advantage. I'm starting to sweat.",
        "11. bxc4": "I have to re-take. Of course, I'm not thrilled with the isolated pawn.......",
        "11... Bc5": "Protecting his d pawn, and bearing down even further on my king.",
        "12. Nd2 Ne7 13. Rb1": "Trying to make something happen.......",
        "13... Qc7 14. Nb3": "And I see the return of the pawn on the horizon.",
        "14... b6 15. Nexd4 Nf5": "I didn't anticipate this. Now I've voluntarily walked into an ugly pin. I do however, see a way to at least delay it's effects.",
        "16. g4 Nxd4 17. Nxd4": "Same pin, but now at least I have a little room to move......",
        "17... O-O-O": "Black has now completed development, but I was surprised he castled long. I would have thought he would go the other way. His queen and king are now on a half open file, and I would like to take advantage of that.....",
        "18. Be3": "Finishing my own development, and interposing the pin.",
        "18... g5 19. Qe4 Bxd4": "Surprising.....I now have dreams of pinning his queen against his king. Then I realize of course that a player this strong would only make this trade off for a reason, so I get a little concerned.",
        "20. Bxd4 Nc5": "Forcing me to repay his trade in kind.",
        "21. Bxc5 Qxc5+ 22. Kh1 Rd4": "Whoops! He left the back door wide open.......",
        "23. Qa8+ Kc7 24. Qxh8 Qc6+": "After winning a rook, I realize that my king better tighten up his laces because he's about to start doing a lot of running.",
        "25. Kg1 Qc5 26. Rf2": "Seeing the danger of a discovered check, but severely restricting this rook's effectiveness.",
        "26... Rxf4 27. Rbf1 Rxg4+ 28. Kh1 Qc6+ 29. Rf2f3": "My opponent is pinning me left and right. My material advantage is pretty worthless right now. I have to get my queen back in the game!",
        "29... Rf4 30. Kg2 g4": "YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "31. Qxh7": "Trying to get my lady back into the fray.",
        "31... gxf3+ 32. Kg3": "Now I get at least ONE move avoiding a check, but at the cost of losing another pawn.",
        "32... Qxc4 33. Rxf3": "Taking back a pawn and trying to create some space for my leader to hide.",
        "33... Rg4+ 34. Kh3 Rf4 35. Rb3 Qf1+ 36. Kg3 Qf2+ 37. Kh3 Rf3+": "Forcing the rook exchange.",
        "38. Rxf3 Qxf3+ 39. Kh4 Kc6 40. Qc2+": "Now my queen is back in play, but I'm still a pawn down and if my king has to move another square he will surely fall over from exhaustion.",
        "40... Kd5 41. Qa4": "Not sure what I was thinking here. A forced queen exchange surely cannot be good for me.",
        "41... Qe4+ 42. Qxe4+ Kxe4 43. Kg5": "And there is the move! My h pawn can now start running:)",
        "43... Kxe5": "Big mistake. Black's king is now on the a1-h8 diagonal, and I'm gonna queen on h8!",
        "44. h4 f5 45. h5 f4 46. h6 f3 47. h7 f2 48. h8=Q+": "Mission accomplished. Now it's time to pick off the f and e pawns.",
        "48... Ke4 49. Qh1+ Ke3 50. Qf1 Kf3 51. Kf6": "And black resigned. A well played game by my opponent up until 43...Kxe5. He was very gracious in defeat, and a true gentleman. One of my better performances in quite a while:)"
