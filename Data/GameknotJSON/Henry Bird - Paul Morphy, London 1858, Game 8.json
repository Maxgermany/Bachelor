        "4. Nc3": "Also good is 4.Bc4, as well as 4.dxe5 fxe4 5.Ng5 d5 6.e6 (6.Nc3!?) 6...Bc5 7.Nc3! (but not immediately 7.Nf7? Qf6 8.Be3 d4 with a counterattack, Barnes-Morphy, London 1858) 7...c6 (7...Qf6 8.Ngxe4 dxe4 9.Qh5+ and Qxc5) 8.Nf7, which was suggested in 1880 by Johann Berger",

        "8... Bd6": "\"A typical Morphy move, striving as soon as possible to overcome his lack of development.\" (Euwe) In Maroczy's opinion, 8...Be7 was more circumspect",

After a series of dubious movies, Bird commits a decisive mistake. \"However, had it not been for this move, chess literature would not have been enriched with one of Morphy's most staggering and profound combinations...After 11.Nxf6+!

Euwe does not agree with this evaluation: \"In the resulting open position the strength of the two black bishops should quickly tell.\" But in Kasparov's opinion,  White would have been lucky to reach such a position, since in fact he is destroyed by the interposition of 12...e3! (this Morphy would NOT have missed!) 13.Qxe3 Rxf6 14.0-0-0 (14.Qg5+ Rg6) 14...Bf8 etc.\nBird's mistake is fully understandable from a psychological standpoint: he already was facing a difficult choice...",

        "18. Bxf2 Qa3": "(!!) A bolt out of the blue! A mistake would have been 18...Ba3? in view of 19.Qe3!. Alas, even this brilliant maneuvre by Morphy does not give more than a draw...",

Whereas Morphy's sound framework and his wide-ranging tactics already resemble the play of a modern GM.
