Bxa1": "Could have taken with bishop or queen but saw that by taking with bishop I would have the threat of knight check winning his bishop through a discovered check and then trading his rook for my knight. Also currently threatening to take his rook still so I still have two threats.",
        "22... Ra7 23. Nf6+": "He removed one threat but this one was simply game. I hope you guys liked how many threats I had going constantly due to my pieces working together so well. It made the game quite fun to play."
