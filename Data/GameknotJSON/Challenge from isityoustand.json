    "moves": {
        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4": "The 3. d4 move makes this an \"Open Sicilian\" game, often characterised as giving rise to very complicated positions",
        "3... Nf6": "3. ..cxd4 is the more common continuation here, but Nf6 is an excellent move",
        "4. dxc5": "4. Nc3 or 4. Bb5+ are both somewhat better here, at least played more often. I would say that white loses a tempo of development",
        "4... Nxe4": "The best move",
        "5. cxd6": "Probably the best. Now the position is as open as it could possibly be!",
        "5... Nc6": "This is probably better than Nxd6, as it favours development",
        "6. Bd3": "A sound developing move. Nbd2 and Be3 also being possible",
        "6... Nxd6": "The best move. ",
        "7. Nc3": "A logical development. c3 and 0-0 were also possible. The position is quite even at this point, which means that White has lost their natural beginner's advantage",
        "7... e6": "Fianchettoing the BSB (black square bishop) with g6 here was probably a better strategy here",
        "8. O-O Be7": "Logical moves",
        "9. Bf4 O-O 10. a3 Nf5 11. Ne4 h6 12. Qd2 Ncd4": "A good move, even though 12. ...g5! might have been still better",
        "13. Nxd4 Qxd4": "This is more aggressive and much better than Nxd4",
        "14. g4": "This is a blunder as it poses no significant threat or gain but seriously weakens White's king position. 14. c3 was the simplest continuation",
        "14... Nh4": "This is a very good move that immediately takes advantage of White's mistake",
        "15. Qe2 Qxb2": "This is \"greedy\". 15. ...f5! had been the strongest continuation of the king side attack",
        "16. g5": "A very good move in this position, although Bg3 was also alright",
        "16... hxg5": "Bxg5 or g6 had been much better",
        "17. Bxg5": "This is a mistake. Nxg5 would have equalised the position",
        "17... Bxg5 18. Nxg5 g6": "Excellent move! Note that 18. ...Nf5 19. Bxf5 exf5 20. Qh5! is winning for White",
        "19. Rfe1": "This is a blunder that probably loses the game. Be4 had been a reasonable continuation",
        "19... Qf6": "Precisely! Now Black has a winning game. White loses their piece or Black checks with Nf3.",
        "20. f4": "Not very much else possible",
        "20... Qxf4 21. Nh3 Qf3 22. Ref1": "Ng5 had yielded less damage. Now the game is over in practise",
        "22... Qxh3 23. Be4 e5": "f5 was a somewhat better possibiity",
        "24. Bd5 Bg4 25. Qxe5 Nf3+": "Very nice game!"
