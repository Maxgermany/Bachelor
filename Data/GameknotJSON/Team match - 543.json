        "1. e4 c5 2. Bc4 Nc6": "IF he's going to let me do it, then I'll do it.  Here comes the Deathslam.",
        "3. Bxf7+": "There it is, the bishop sacrifice, to be followed by Kxf7.   Whatever plan my opponent had, he's going to need a different one now.",
        "3... Kxf7 4. Qh5+": "Queen comes out, check, and I'll take the pawn at C5 on the next move.",
        "4... g6 5. Qxc5": "He'll probably move his King's Pawn now so his bishop will attack my queen, so I'll move my queen to a more protected area so he can't just develop his pieces by attacking my queen.",
        "5... e6 6. Qe3 Bg7 7. Nf3": "Got another piece out, threatening check on the next move with my knight, and cleared the side out so I can castle if I want.",
        "7... h6 8. c3": "I did this to thwart his bishop and his knight.",
        "8... Nge7 9. d4": "Taking command of the middle of the board now.",
        "9... d5 10. e5": "Perfect.   Neither of his bishops have any offensive position at all, and one of his knights can only move to the side of the board.   Ten moves in and he's got nothing going.",
        "10... Na5 11. b3": "This move stops his knight....again.....and will permit me to deploy my bishop to a3 where it'll be able to shoot all the way down to f8.   I'll probably put my other knight at d2 so that my knights can guard each other."
