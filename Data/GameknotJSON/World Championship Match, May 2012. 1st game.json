Bb5+!? was perhaps Anand\u2019s way of sidestepping his opponent\u2019s prematch preparations, as after the game\u2019s 8. \u2026 Nc6 9. d5, the line 9. \u2026 a6?! 10. Be2 Bxc3+ 11. Bd2 Bxa1 12. Qxa1 Nd4 13. Nxd4 cxd4 14. Qxd4 0-0 15. 0-0 is one of the classic Grunfeld variations where White\u2019s two bishops are considered worth at least as much as the lost exchange.\"",
        "8. Bb5+ Nc6 9. d5": "I guess all this should be well covered by theory. Since I don't study, it seems a very interesting and tactic game to me... :-). \n\nI don't guarantee the quality of the moves in the following lines, then! Theorists are welcomed to pitiless destroy my attempts to explore myself some well-known lines, probably choosing the wrong way. I'm only enjoying myself. \n\nNow, black can try to cash in with 9... Bxc3+, 10. Bd2 (just guessing, no books),  BxRa1 (saying that he's greedy), 11. Qxd1 (this threatens the Rh8 - wow, so I guess black's best option is 0-0. Now it's white's turn to cash in with 12. dxNc6. \n\nfen=\"r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2P3p1/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/P2B1PPP/Q3K2R b K -\"\n\nNow, black must choose between two lines: \n\na) 12... bxc6, 13. Bxc6, Rb8, (with a possible follow up as 14. o-o!?, Bg4 -attacking-, 15. Ne5 (threatening the fork Nd7?), QxBd2, 16. NxBg4, Rb2 17. a4, Rf-b8, and black seems to have a good edge, despite material theoretical equalness. \n\n\"fen=1r4k1/p3pp1p/2B3p1/2p5/P3P1N1/8/1r1q1PPP/Q4RK1 w - -\"\n\nb) ...or try to look for ANOTHER move, waiting for a possible cxb7 with Bxb7 (which white won't do, probably). Keeping in mind, of course, all the complications if Bg4...\n\nBack to a), let's imagine that after 13. Rb8, white gets greedy, and wants to cash in an exchange by the mate threat 14. Bh6. It seems that the only defence for black is f6, so we have: \n\n\"fen=1rbq1rk1/p3p2p/2B2ppB/2p5/4P3/5N2/P4PPP/Q3K2R w K -\"\n\nOnce you see that 15. Ng5 leads to nothing, I tried the simple one, 15. BxRf8. This could be a clear loss by black, so you would advise him not to play this. But black has another interesting move: 15. Qa5. \nWould this move will be able to compensate black's exchange (or even full rook, if necessary)?\nLooking at it, it seems black has a powerful attack, here. But can it lead to victory?\n\nWhen these kind of situation happens in real games, I sink in a sea so deep that I often end with the wrong move (see my game with Symbian, annotated, if you want to laugh at me :-(. )\n\nOk, let's see: \n\n\"fen=1rb2Bk1/p3p2p/2B2pp1/q1p5/4P3/5N2/P4PPP/Q3K2R w K -\"\n\nI explored the logical 16. Nd2. I cannot remember the line, but I couldn't find a clear win if black, instead of the natural KxBf8, goes Ba6 (it smells like mate, but where's the roast-beef?), or tries to proceed harassing the bishop with Rb6. Anyway... let's see if white can afford 16. Ke2... (it is only the last line of several dozens I found, and I can't swear it is the best...)\n\n16. Kd1 is a choice to be explored. The other is...\n\n\"fen=1rb2Bk1/p3p2p/2B2pp1/q1p5/4P3/5N2/P3KPPP/Q6R b - -\"\n\nof course black goes on attacking, and very strongly, but hey: white is about to play Bxd7, and then f6 gets fatally weak: black has no easy way to defend it. So, after all, white can go like that, after all, just to tempt - as to say - black to go on with the attack and getting unable to defend f6 after the storm is gone. For example: \n\n16... Ba6+, 17. Ke3 (practically forced because white cannot affor the blac",
        "9... Qa5": "Well... the previous message was cut by GK's UNADVISED limit of comment's lenght. \n\nOk, I understand I cannow write an entire book on a position, but please, programmers, WARN me FIRST, please!!\n\nIt never mind. I just wanted to show whay happens to me when analyzing a particularly tactic postion like this. My life stops, and I frequently get lost. And this is the reason I don't play seriouslyu anymore (sigh!).\n\nBut the astonisching think is theory \"must\" have explored all these lines - for sure, and for sure \"all this work is in vain\", since if the world's champions don't go inte them, it must be that all this is so well known by them that both are sure they will get to an even position... and black prefers to go otherwise, overattacking c3, thus complicating even more the situation. \n\nThis amazes me. Gelfand's preparation behind this move implies to have reviewed all the lines after Bxc3+, white goes in (because he know he will survive and even get an advantage for the fork... \nBut black has this trick... \n\nAnd the comments say that the game was not \"such a big deal\" (no literally, of course :-). \n\nChess IS EXCITING :-D\n\n\nThe last line of the previous message was: \n\n\n10.\tc1-d2\tc3-a1\n11.\td1-a1\te8-g8\n12.\td5-c6\tb7-c6\n13.\tb5-c6\ta8-b8\n14.\td2-h6\tf7-f6\n15.\th6-f8\td8-a5+\n16.\te1-e2\tc8-a6+\n17.\te2-e3\ta5-a3+\n18.\te3-f4\ta6-c8\n19.\tf8-e7\tg6-g5+\n20.\tf3-g5\tf6-g5+\n21.\tf4-g5\tc8-e6\n22.\tg5-h6\ta3-b2\n23.\te7-f6\tb2-d2+\n\n(I cannot decoy it again now!!!)\n",
