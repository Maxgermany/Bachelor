        "1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 d6 5. Nc3 a6": "5. ....... a6 (the first 5 moves are standard Sicilian.  This is the Naijdorf although it does transpose into a position resembling a Yugoslav Attack)",
        "6. Be3 g6 7. Qd2 Bg7 8. f3 e6 9. O-O-O d5 10. exd5 exd5 11. Kb1": "11. Kb1 (over the last few moves we have been concentrating on development - although I am slightly ahead.  If black castles kingside, maybe I could start a pawn storm).  I safeguard my castled position first.",
        "11... Nge7 12. a3": "12. a3 - stops the black knight moving to b4.  Black now gets ideas of her own by playing her queen to a5.",
        "12... Qa5 13. Nxc6 bxc6 14. Bd4 Bxd4 15. Qxd4 O-O": "15. ....... O-O (black finally castles - her position has been weakened by the exchange of dark squared bishops).  I now zero in on it.",
        "16. Qf6 Re8 17. h4": "17. h4 - I now start the pawn storm.",
        "17... Rb8 18. g4 Be6 19. h5": "19. h5 (storm clouds gather over both castled positions - who gets there first?)",
        "19... Qxa3": "19. ........ Qxa3 - the start of a lot of blood letting - I lose a pawn.  I concentrate on getting my king to comparative safety by moving him to c1.",
        "20. Kc1 Qxb2+": "20. ....... Qxb2  (another pawn goes, and my king now has to run for the hills!)",
        "21. Kd2 d4 22. Ne4": "22. Ne4 (my knight was en prise last move, I move it towards the kingside)",
        "22... Nd5 23. Qg5 Qb4+ 24. Ke2 Nc3+ 25. Nxc3 Qxc3": "25.  Qxc3 - black's king hunt continues and knights have been exchanged.  My queen has been driven from h6.  I now have time to pick up the threads of my own mating attack before .........",
        "26. hxg6 Bxg4+": "...... it begins again with a discovered check 26...... Bxg4 , another pawn goes!",
        "27. Kf2": "27. Kf2 - my king tries to find a foxhole on the kingside, can he do it?",
        "27... Qxf3+": "27........... No the carnage continues with Qxf3 , I lose a fourth pawn!",
        "28. Kg1 Qg3+ 29. Bg2 fxg6 30. Rf1": "30. Rf1 - after further checks from the black queen I make my king's position as safe as possible and also take some control of the f file - I still have hopes that I can do something.",
        "30... Re1 31. Qf6 Rxf1+ 32. Qxf1 Re8": "32. ........... Re8 - take a look at white everyone, this position looks resignable and I was resigned to losing 7 rating points.  It looks resignable because I have lost 4 pawns, my bishop is horribly pinned and it looks as though my queen is going to be pinned too.  I have one last throw of the dice, however.",
        "33. Qc4+": "33. Qc4 !! - I can hold black off for at least one move, little did I know what black would walk into on his next move and that this would be the turning point of the game.  ",
        "33... Kh8 34. Qxd4+": "34. Qxd4  - I get a pawn back - hurrah!  Best of all my queen has some checking lines.  Dare I hope I will avoid the blob?",
        "34... Re5": "34. ...... Re5 - I now do some serious \"analyze the board\" and I came up with 35. Qd8  being a sound move.  I am now optimistic that I can keep my opponent in check permanently.",
        "35. Qd8+ Kg7 36. Qc7+ Kf6 37. Qd8+ Kf5 38. Qf8+": "38. Qf8  - notice that my pinned bishop cuts off the e4 square from the black king, which decided to go to g5 where my queen gets support from the rook on h1",
        "38... Kg5 39. Qh6+ Kf6 40. Qf8+ Ke6 41. Qe8+ Kf6": "41. ........ Kf6 - if black had played her king to d6 I would have taken off the c pawn (another pawn back) with 42. Qxc6 .  The king would have been forced back to the second rank where my rook would have got in on the act by winning back another pawn with check.  All my moves have to be checks or the Sword of Damocles descends from e5.  With the queen and rook working together in tandem it looks as if it will be black who cops Old Matey instead - but black plays Kf6.",
        "42. Qf8+": "42.  Qf8  - I now feel 100% sure my opponent cannot escape the checks.  I therefore offer her a draw.  I have an extremely anxious half an hour or so of clicking on the refresh button!  Finally the message comes in.  Game drawn.  Wheeew!"
