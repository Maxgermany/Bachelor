        "12... Qb6": "Qb6? black want pressure on white center but b6 is a big problem: b7 is blocked",

        "18... e6 19. f5": "i think the best move to open kingside rook",
        "19... d5": "the best defence, i think, but now black have to defend his centre...now Ra1-d1 is very dangerous, Bb6 control d8",

        "24. Bf2": "sacrifice pawn to do f6!\r\nwhy not Bd4 or Be3 ?\r\n24.Bd4 i think is not good becouse d5 now is defended so 24...f6 and Rad8 with a5 attacked; with b4, c3 is a serius problem\r\n24.Be3  Re8 and f6",
