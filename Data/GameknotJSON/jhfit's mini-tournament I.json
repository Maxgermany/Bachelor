        "4. Nc3 Bc5 5. a3 d6 6. b4 Bb6 7. e3 Be6 8. Nd5": "White is too active with the same piece, and taking the bishop is good enough for Black. ",
        "8... O-O 9. Ne2 e4": "e4! Strong pressure here and should not have been allowed.",
        "10. Nec3 Ne5 11. O-O Nxd5 12. Nxd5 Bg4": "The e4 pawn will be a very active square and shows the danger in this set-up, and how weak the light squares around the king really are.",
        "13. Qc2 Nf3+ 14. Kh1 Re8 15. Bb2 Qg5 16. h4 Qf5 17. Qc3": "White risked a lot for a chance at a quick checkmate. Black is positioned for attack and defense.",

        "19... Ne5": "Ne5! A block and clearing the key f3 square.",

        "22... Qh3+": "  White resigned. The quick loss by White here centered around the weak h3 and f3 squares, as it often does, even though the light-squared bishop was present. Other moves like Kg1, instead of cxb6, last longer, but the attack goes through the f and h files no matter what. "
