        "11. d3": "White developes the center.",
        "11... f5": "Black's plan is to attack the e and d file but it's a bad move for it weakens black's king. (my opponent thinks it is the losing move and looking at it now, I think he is right.)",
        "12. Bd2": "White carries on developping his pieces",
        "12... Bd5": "With the a2 g8 diagonal open and the king on g 8, trading the bishop is a strategical mistake. ",

        "13... Nxd5": "That was black's aim : to bring a knight on the center (The brave Lancelot was so impatient)",

        "16... c6": "The footman comes and help his knight.",
        "17. Ne6": "I had foreseen this move but thought, trading one rook against the advanced white knight was not so bad (compared to others possibilities).",

        "19. exd5": "Argh...",
        "19... cxd5": "Revenge but black's situation is very bad : 4 points late in material. The fact that white has a weak pawn on the d file and that black dominates the center doesn't compensate this late.",

        "30. Rec1 Nxa3": "To take a pawn but I should probably have plaid 30. Bd4 to keep the center complicated and protect f5. Probably Perceval's morale was no more sufficient to properly fight.",
