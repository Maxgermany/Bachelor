        "24. Bxg5 Qxg5": "I get the Bishop. White spends the next several moves threatening my Queen in different ways.",
        "25. h4 Qf6 26. g5 Qf5 27. Bh3 Qf7 28. Rg1": "White probably intended to do pawn to g6 on the next turn and threaten my queen again.",

        "40. Rg1 Nxc4+": "Although I took a material loss on this move, it did something very important: forced White to take my knight with the pawn and opening up a line of attack on the King. If White had simply moved the King away, I would have gotten the Queen, so it was basically a win-win situation.",
        "41. dxc4 Qe3+ 42. Qxe3 dxe3+": "Trading Queens",

        "58. f6 Re8 59. Kg7 c3 60. f7 Rd8": "White basically has no more options left. He can't move his pawn forward to promote it because then the Rook can take it. The King can't threaten the rook to force it to move because my king guards the key squares. (White's king could only threaten my rook on e7 or c7, neither of which are open due to the position of my king.)",
        "61. f8=Q+": "White is out of options here. One avenue left for White would be to try and force a stalemate, but since I've lost games by stalemate in similar situations, I don't want that to happen again.",
