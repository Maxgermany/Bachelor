        "9... Bb5": "Preventing the imminent castle at least for the moment",
        "10. Be3": "I'm still unsure of this move, perhaps just for a development and for a battery?",

        "18. Rab1": "My queen will be traded out or I lose my bishop entirely",
        "18... Rxd2 19. Bxd2": "I was rather surprised at this move, I assumed he'd take the queen, but instead he tried to launch an attack at my weak base.",
