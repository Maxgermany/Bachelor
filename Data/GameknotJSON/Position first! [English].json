I'd say, there's the evidence: a fork on Rook and Knight.\nWhat can he do? Moving the Rook - the Knight is dead. Moving the Knight - the Rook is dead. As you will see, he will choose to make some mess in my defence with his Knight while losing his Rook, and win a tempo to move his Knight back.\nBut... there's something else. My Queen and d Knight are now aligned. This means that I will no longer consider taking pieces and preferably will rely on my position advantage.",
