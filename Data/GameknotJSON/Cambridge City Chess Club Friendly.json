        "1. e4": "Hi everyone!  This game was played against a nine-year old boy called Adam.  Incredibly I was 20 years older than him when this was played.  This was to be my only game out of quite a few games against him that I would get anything other than The Blob, so I was really chuffed by this one victory.",
        "1... e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ Qxf6": "5. ................... Qxf6 - this started off as a Winawer French.  I now eschew that exchange on f6 with the queen by playing Nbd7 to prepare Nf6 but this was how I used to play twelve years ago.",
        "6. Bd3 c5": "6. ................. c5 - an essential pawn break I feel.",
        "7. c3 cxd4 8. cxd4 Nc6 9. Nf3 Bb4+ 10. Bd2 Bxd2+ 11. Qxd2 Bd7": "11. ..................... Bd7 - now both sides have cleared wood off the back rank and have the option of where to castle and we both choose the kingside.",
        "12. Bb5 O-O 13. O-O Rad8 14. Bxc6 Bxc6 15. Ne5": "15. Kte5?? - bad move - drops piece as the d pawn is pinned!",
        "15... Qxe5 16. dxe5 Rxd2": "16. .............. Rxd2 - not only has white lost a piece but just look where my rook is.  The squeeze is on!",
        "17. b4 Rfd8 18. a4 a6": "18. ................ a6.  After this move my opponent threw in the sponge.  Good win."
