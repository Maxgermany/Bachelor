        "1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2": "A rather passive approach to the Caro-Kann.",
        "3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7": "Black also plays a quiet move. Neither player is willing to open the game up yet.",
        "5. Bc4": "Beginning to pressure Black's K-side.",
        "5... Ngf6 6. Ng5": "Attacking the weak point at KB7. Deep Blue used the same Knight move against an exhausted Garry Kasparov in a Caro-Kann to win the decisive Game 6 of the second match, thus making a computer World Champion. Humans have, as yet, been unable to reclaim that mantle.",
        "6... e6 7. Qe2 Nb6": "Preparing to drive the advanced White Knight.",
        "8. Bd3 h6 9. Ng5f3": "The scene appears utterly pacific. Black should focus on keeping the game closed and getting his King into safety.",
        "9... c5": "A strategic error. White has the initiative and can exploit the opening up of the game better than Black.",
        "10. dxc5 Nbd7 11. b4 b6": "I would think that 11... B-K2, preparing 12... O-O, would be a better plan. With the game opening up, Black needs to get his King out of the center.",
        "12. Nd4": "Threatening to penetrate decisively.",
        "12... bxc5": "Allowing a sharp tactical sequence.",
        "13. Nc6": "The Queen must bestir herself.",
        "13... Qc7": "Getting the Q out of immediate danger. However...",
        "14. Qxe6+": "...this move is decisive. Black resigns, as the Q cannot be captured [14... PxQ 15 B-N6 mate] and interposing doesn't solve the problem [14... B-K2 15 QxB mate]."
