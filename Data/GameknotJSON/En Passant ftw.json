        "4... Ng6 5. e5 Ng8": "Ne4 was impossible due to 6. f5!  Then, if ...Nxe5 or Ng4, Qd4 or Qg4, respectively, wins a knight.",
        "6. Nc3 e6 7. dxe6": "Leaves black with an uncomfortable choice of recaptures.",
        "7... fxe6 8. Bd3": "Threatening Qh5.",
        "8... Ng8e7 9. Qh5": "Black's in trouble now.",
        "9... Kf7": "Probably better was 9...Nf5, to which I would have played Nf3 followed by g4.",
        "10. Nf3 Kg8": "? The losing move.  Correct was ...d6, though black's still losing.",
        "11. f5": "! wins a knight by force.",
        "11... Nxf5": "This actually was black's best move, regaining a pawn for the piece.",
        "12. Qxf5": "Queen sac woo.",
        "12... exf5": "?? Opens the line for mate.  The f-pawn recapture comes back to bite Black.  Oddly, it's the a2-g8 diagonal that's fatal, not the usual h5-e8 one.",
        "13. Bc4+ d5": "My opponent must have thought that this would have been adequate, but...",
        "14. exd6 e.p.+": "en passant wins the game!",
        "14... Be6 15. Bxe6#": "Practically a smothered mate.  This mate has been known to occur when white moves his king to g1 in the king's gambit.  I hoped you all enjoyed this short, humorous (to me anyway) game."
