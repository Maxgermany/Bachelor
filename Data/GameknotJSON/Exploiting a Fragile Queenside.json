    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "I managed to close two games against this opponent in the same day. This completes my sweep of my group of the 54th GK Tournament at 6-0, although now I will get moved up to the next category anyway. I start with the open game.",
        "1... c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4": "Sicilian. Ordinary stuff so far.",
        "4... Nf6 5. f3": "The main line is 5. Nc3. But this move is in the DB and has a much better record as white, though it's only played about one time for every 45 times the main line is played. Still, the guys playing it have equally high ratings, so they likely know what they're doing, so I thought I'd give it a try.",
        "5... a6 6. Nc3": "We get to the same position anyway. This line is part of the Moscow Variation.",
        "6... e5 7. Nb3 Be6 8. Be3 Be7 9. Qd2": "It's like my opponent and I are reading from the same playbook. Since move 6, we've both been playing the most-played move right out of the DB, so I guess we're still \"in book\".",
        "9... O-O 10. O-O-O": "Still according to the DB.",
        "10... b5 11. g4": "10. ... b5 was where black first deviated from the recommended moves. In fact, 10. ... Nb7 is played far more often, by the highest-rated players, and has a slight 35%-34% edge for black. 10. ... b5 is only played 1/3 as often, by the lowest-rated players of the viable options, and gives a 45%-30% edge to white. Maybe not the best time to deviate from book. White's response is still textbook DB, beginning a pawn avalanche aimed at black's castle.",
        "11... Nc6 12. Nd5": "With 11. ... Nc6 black once again chooses the least favorable of the options in the DB, and white plays the main response. An interesting trap here, if black is unwary, for 12. Nxd5? loses a piece after 13. exd5. The DB had recommended 11. ... b4 for black to play a little avalanche of his own. Note that white's knight on d5 threatens to remove one of the defenders of the black pawn on d6, simultaneously exposing an attack up the half-open d-file against the same pawn.",
        "12... Rb8 13. h4": "And now we are completely out of the DB. Black places his rook to support his pawn advance. I had expected the rook to play to c8 instead, seizing the half-open file, but then after black's play I realized that the other rook wants that file, which leaves the queen's rook to remain on the a- and b-files to support the pawns. White continues with his avalanche, although in retrospect, I think 13. Nxe7 may have been better. This move as played allows black to defend, though he has limited options. 13. ... Ne8 might work.",
        "13... a5 14. Nxe7+ Qxe7 15. Qxd6": "Black continued on the queenside, so white finally pounces on the d6 pawn.",
        "15... Qxd6 16. Rxd6": "Risky business by black, exchanging queens when he just dropped a pawn. Black's queenside looks fragile. At this point, I was torn between pressing on the kingside, or simply exploiting the fragile queenside.",
        "16... Rfc8 17. Kb1": "Moving the king off of the half-open c-file, out of the black rook's line of fire. Black's move made up my mind for me. With his rook off of f8, any pawn avalanche will simply be met by black exchanging the pawns then running his king back to the center, or queenside. So I decide to go after the queenside - but not to overcommit; I may still rebound back to the kinside attack.",
        "17... Nd7 18. Nc1": "Aiming for d3, close enough to help defend the king, but also ready to help on the kingside if needed too.",
        "18... Nb4 19. Rh2": "Defending c2.",
        "19... Kf8 20. c3 Nc6 21. Rhd2": "White drives away the irritating knight then doubles rooks on the only open file.",
        "21... Ke7 22. Nb3": "21. ... Ke7 mystified me a little. I had expected either 21. ... Ke8 or 21. ... Nb3. Then I realized it stopped my plans of deploying my knight on d3. So, now the knight looks silly as it bounces back to b3.",
        "22... Nd8 23. Nxa5": "Black surrendered the pawn, but I'm not sure why. Maybe he was just opening the c-file for his rook.",
        "23... b4 24. cxb4 Rxb4 25. a3": "Well, that puts an end to black's avalanche, and gives white a pair of adjacent passed pawns in the process. Time to entice black's rooks to go away now.",
        "25... Ra4 26. Ra6": "25. ... Ra4? was dangerous, and I think there may be nothing black can do now to avoid losing more material. White's threat now is 27. Nc6+ which wins the exchange.",
        "26... Nc5 27. Ra7+": "26. ... Nc5? seems to defend the rook, but white can simply play 27. Bxc4+ Rxc4 28. Nc6+ and still win the exchange, with the added bonus of trading of a pair of minor pieces too. But, white finds an even better stunt. Now black is busted. 27. ... Bd7 is met with 28. Bxc5+ Rxc5 29. Raxd7+ Kf6 30. Rxd8 and white gains three pieces for one.",
        "27... Kf8 28. Bxc5+": "Black tried a different way, but it's no good either. White gains a piece instantly (28. ... Rxc5??? Rxd8#). After 28. ... Kg8, white wins with 29. Ba6 Rb8 30. Bd6 and now black's rook on the back rank has nowhere to hide from the white bishops. Black is already down a piece and two pawns, and now is faced with losing a rook too, so he resigns summarily."
