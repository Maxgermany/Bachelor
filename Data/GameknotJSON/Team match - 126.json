        "1. d4 d5 2. f3 e6 3. Bf4 Bb4+": "Nf6 is a pretty strong move for black in the Queen's Pawn opening.  Bb4 forces white to move Pc3, which white wants to do anyway, and then black must withdraw.  The upshot is that white develops his position while black moves the same piece a couple of times.",
        "4. c3 Be7 5. g3 Kf8": "?  It is generally a bad idea to move the king at this time, except to castle.  Now the rooks are confined to the edges of the board.  It will take many moves to align them on center files.",
        "6. e3 g5 7. Be5 f6": "Both of these pawn moves would have trapped white's black bishop without moving the king.",
        "8. Bxc7 Qxc7 9. Bh3 h5 10. Bf1": "?  White just wasted two moves.",
        "10... Bd7 11. f4 g4 12. Bd3 b5 13. h3 Qa5 14. b4 Qc7 15. Na3": "Oops.  Pc3 is now undefended.  QxPc3+ gives black Na3 too.  Knight and pawn for free.",
        "15... Qxc3+ 16. Kf1 Qxa3": "Yes, just like that!",
        "17. Qb3": "Down six points a queen trade is ill advised for white.  Black would also gain by doubling white's pawns.",
        "17... Qa6 18. hxg4 Nc6 19. gxh5": "Here I like BxPb4.  It is a free pawn.  Or maybe NxPb4.  ",
        "19... Nh6 20. Rc1 Ng4 21. Bg6": "BxPb4 looks pretty good.",
        "21... Bxb4": ":)",
        "22. Rh4": "Now I'm thinking 23. Bd2 Rd1 24. NxPe3+.  The bishop will protect the knight from QxNe3.",
        "22... Nxe3+": "Nope, because QxNe3.  The pawn is not worth the knight.",
        "23. Qxe3": "Here obviously QxPa2.  This way the queen can protect d2, as in Bd2 forks the white queen and c rook.",
        "23... Ba3": "The pawn was a better choice.",
        "24. Rc3": "Unless white moves the rook here.  Sweet deal!  Out of the frying pan, into the fire.  Pb4+ gives black the rook.",
        "24... b4+": "Lovely!",
        "25. Kf2 bxc3 26. Qxc3 Bb4 27. Qe3 Qxa2+ 28. Kf3 Bd2 29. Qe2": "Oops, NxPd4+ forks the queen.",
        "29... Nxd4+ 30. Kf2 Nxe2 31. Nxe2 Rb8 32. f5 Rb1 33. h6 Be1+ 34. Ke3 Qd2+ 35. Kf3 Rb3+ 36. Kg4 Qxe2+ 37. Kh3 Rxg3#": ""
