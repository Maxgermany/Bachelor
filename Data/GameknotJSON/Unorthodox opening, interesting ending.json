        "1. f3": "paulmag's reasoning for this opening was \"Have played it many times to try and develop my game with this opening, one mistake and am dead.\"",
        "1... e5": "When meeting an unorthodox opening, standard opening moves such as center pawns are good.",
        "2. Kf2": "Continuing his unorthodox opening. There are several names for this opening; Gameknot calls it Hammerschlag.",
        "2... d5": "Continuing the push in the middle.",
        "3. e3": "Opening the line for the bishop and protecting against Bc5 .",
        "3... Nf6": "Another developing move.",
        "4. c4": "Finally pushing against my center.",
        "4... Nc6": "Another developing move. I see no advantage from dxc4.",
        "5. Nc3": "Finally developing a piece, but as my reply shows, cxd5 first would have been better.",
        "5... d4": "Pushing the knight away.",
        "6. Nd5": "There are no pleasant alternatives. 6. exd4 Qxd4  is uncomfortable for black. 6...dxe3  following other knight moves is also bad for black.",
        "6... Nxd5": "Winning a pawn.",
        "7. cxd5 Qxd5 8. e4": "Pushing the queen away.",
        "8... Qe6": "The queen doesn't accomplish anything here and ends up moving later.  d6, c5, or a5 are probably better, since the black bishop can't move yet.",
        "9. Qc2": "Supporting Bc4, but again the queen doesn't accomplish much here. d3 and g3 (with the possibility of Bh3) would be good.",
        "9... Be7": "Preparing O-O. Toga likes giving back a pawn with 9...Nb4 10. Qxc7 d3, and Rybka likes 9...Nb4 10. Qb1 d3 11. Bxd3 Bc5 ",
        "10. a3": "Preventing Nb4, but unnecessary. An immediate Bc4 would be better.",
        "10... O-O": "Also possible was giving back the pawn with an attack with 10...d3 11. Bxd3 Nd4 12. Qc3 Qb6 or 10...d3 11. Qxd3 Bc5 ",
        "11. Bc4": "Forcing the queen to move again.",
        "11... Qd6": "g6 or f6 are probably better places for the queen. d3 again was possible, with the idea of Bc5 , and Qf6 and Qh4.",
        "12. d3": "Giving extra support to c4 and e4, opening the line for the bishop, and finally preventing d3 by black.",
        "12... Kh8": "Unpinning the f pawn in preparation for my next move. Another possibility would be to get rid of the bishop with 12...Na5 13. Ba2 Be6.",
        "13. g3": "Preparing f4? Better would be to continue development with Bd2 or Ne2.",
        "13... f5": "Helping to get the light bishop and rook into the game. Also starting a kingside attack, with the f3 pawn as a focus.",
        "14. exf5": "Also possible is 14. Bd2 fxe4 15. dxe4, developing a piece, but making the d pawn a passed pawn.",
        "14... Bxf5": "Better than Rxf5, since the rook can't accomplish anything on the 5th rank at this point.",
        "15. Qd1": "Overdefending f3, but it keeps the queen passive. Better would be developing the bishop with Bd2 or moving the king out of a potential pin with Kg2.",
        "15... Na5": "Pushing back the bishop as a defender of d3.",
        "16. Ba2 e4": "I thought this simply won a pawn, but I missed white's 18th move. Qg6 first would be better, although it allows 17. b4 Nc6 18. Bc4.",
        "17. dxe4 Bxe4 18. Bf4": "Although it wins the exchange for a pawn, it loses the bishop pair, so the positional disadvantages of the doubled pawns and an unsafe king seem to outweigh any material advantage. Kg2 to escape the pin may be best.",
        "18... Rxf4 19. gxf4 Bc6": "Intended to keep pressure on f3, but f4 is the easier target. Better would be Bf5 or 19...Bh4  20. Kg2 Qg6  21. Kh3 Bc1 22. Qf1 (Toga thinks Qc1 is significantly worse) Nc4 23. Qxc4 Bf2 (threatening Bf5#) 24. Bb1 Bxb1 25. Rxb1 Qxb1",
        "20. Qd2": "Attacks the knight and defends f4, but better was Qd3 to prevent 20...Bh4  21. Kg2 (21. Kf1 Bb5  22. Qg6 ) Qg6 ",
        "20... b6": "Protects the knight, but better was Bh4  as mentioned previously.",
        "21. h4": "Allowing the rook to get out. Perhaps a better way to do so would be Ne2.",
        "21... Rf8": "Attacking f4. Perhaps best is adding more pressure from the passed pawn with d3.",
        "22. b4": "Should have failed as described in next move. Better would be Re1 (22...Rxf4? 23. Rxe7 Qxe7 24. Qxf4)",
        "22... Nb7": "I missed Rxf4!, which could continue 23. Rh3 Rxh4 24. Rxh4 Bxh4  and the knight can move, 23. bxa5 Bxh4  24. Rxh4 (other moves eventually force white to lose his queen) Rxh4, or 23. Qd3 Be4 and the knight could move after the queen moves.",
        "23. Kg3": "Again, Re1 or Rc1 would be a better way to protect the pawn.",
        "23... Qg6+": "Pushing the king back. The queen no longer attacks f4 and defends d4, but is otherwise better placed since it has open lines.",
        "24. Kf2 Bd6": "Adding an attacker to f4, but better would be activating the knight with Nd6 or preparing Bxh4  with Qh5 (25. Kg3? Rxf4 26. Qxf4 Bd6 27. Qxd6 Nxd6 wins a pawn and queen for the rook and bishop). I also ignored the threat to the d4 pawn.",
        "25. Bb1": "Would accomplish nothing after 25...Qh6 (26. Qxd4 is possible, but the f4 or h4 pawn would soon be captured), and doesn't even defend the pawn, as will be shown. Better would be Ne2, defending f4 and attacking d4. (Trading those pawns would be advantageous for black.)",
        "25... Bxf4": "I was thinking of the game continuation, but better play by white would have cut my advantage, as the next note will show. Better would be Qh6, planning to trade the d4 pawn for the h4 pawn.",
        "26. Bxg6": "After 26. Qxf4 Rxf4 27. Bxg6 hxg6 or 26...Qxg1  27. Rxg1 Rxf4 28. Rg4 Rxf3  29. Ke2 Nd8 30. Rxd4, black would only have a minor advantage.",
        "26... Bxd2 27. Bd3": "Probably the best location for the bishop, with the possibility of Bc4 or Ba6.",
        "27... Be3+": "Sometime in the next few moves I should have gotten my knight into the game with Nd6.",
        "28. Kg2 Bxg1": "Trading my active bishop for white's passive knight was not worth the one pawn I should have won.",
        "29. Rhxg1 Rxf3": "Hoping to take advantage of the discovered check, which I ended up doing.",
        "30. Be2": "Attacking the bishop with Rac1 would have avoided losing material (30...Rxd3 ? 31. Rxc6 Rxa3? 32. Rxc7 and 33. Rxb7 is obviously no good for black)",
        "30... Rxa3+": "If white had immediately forced the rook trade the game would have been drawish; I would have been better not winning material with something like Re3 .",
        "31. Kh2": "Better would be protecting the bishop with Kf2, which would have forced the rook trade.",
        "31... Re3": "Keeping the rooks on by attacking the bishop.",
        "32. Ba6": "Finally black is forced to play Nd6. I don't think Bg4 is any better as a5 is fine for black.",
        "32... Nd6 33. Rac1": "Better is Rgc1 since it leaves open the future possibility of Rxa7.",
        "33... Rc3": "Better would have been trading the bishops instead with 33...Bb5 34. Bxb5 Nxb5. The game shows how well the rook overmatched the knight, so my chances probably would have been better keeping the rooks on. The doubled pawns are also annoying for black.",
        "34. Rxc3 dxc3 35. Rf1": "A waste of time with an easily spotted mate threat. White would be better to play Rc1 immediately, or even better, Bd3, after which would follow 35...Be4 36. Bxe4 Nxe4 or 35...Bb5 36. Bc2.",
        "35... g6": "I was thinking it would be better to move the king to Kg7 while also advancing the g pawn slightly, but moving the king laterally first with Kg8 may have been better.",
        "36. Rc1": "Now Bd3 is not as good because the trade can take place on b5 instead since the bishop would be pinned.",
        "36... Bb5": "The only way to avoid losing material.",
        "37. Bxb5": "Also possible was 37. Rxc3 Bxa6 38. Rxc7, with Rxa7 to follow (the knight cannot stay on b5 without trapping the bishop since Bc8 would lose the bishop).",
        "37... Nxb5 38. Kg3": "Better would be Kg2 to avoid the tactic described in the next move.",
        "38... Kg7": "Missing the tactic 38...Nd4 allowing 39...c2 since 39. Rxc3?? loses the rook to Ne2 .",
        "39. Kf4": "Both players move their kings towards the center.",
        "39... Kf6": "Probably better is moving on the kingside with h6 or Kh6.",
        "40. Ke4 c6": "Keeping the white king out and setting up what looks like a strong position.",
        "41. Kd3": "Freeing up the rook. The rook could have moved to f1 first.",
        "41... h6": "Preparing to create a passed pawn.",
        "42. Re1": "Better is Rf1  eventuallly forcing the king to g7 or the d file.",
        "42... g5 43. hxg5+ hxg5": "It's usually easier to promote a g pawn than an h pawn.",
        "44. Rf1+": "The rook can keep the king behind the pawn.",
        "44... Kg6 45. Rg1 a5": "It may have been better to lose the doubled c pawn with a6 and 46...Nc7 rather than trading these two pawns for the one white pawn. When I first made this move, I was thinking 46. bxa5 bxa5 47. Ra1 g4 48. Rxa5 g3 49. Ra1 Kg5 50. Rg1 Kg4, which I believe is winning for black. From this point Toga evaluated the position at 0.00 except when white made errors.",
        "46. bxa5 bxa5 47. Ra1": "Better is stopping the a pawn with Rg4.",
        "47... g4": "Trying to advance the g pawn enough that white will be forced to trade his rook for it.",
        "48. Rxa5 g3 49. Ra8": "Getting his rook behind the g pawn, so the king could be stuck on g2.",
        "49... Kg5 50. Rg8+ Kh4 51. Rh8+ Kg4 52. Rg8+ Kh3 53. Rh8+ Kg2 54. Rg8 Nd6": "Trying to maneuver the knight so it could get in front of the king and/or g pawn. The general idea is to force the rook to sacrifice itself for the g pawn, while the knight can get back to protect the c pawn in time.",
        "55. Kxc3 Kf3": "With the idea of getting the knight on e4, hopefully while the white rook is moving.",
        "56. Rf8+": "A simpler draw is Kd4, where 56...Ne4 fails to 57. Rf8  and 58. Kxe4, and otherwise the black knight cannot help the g pawn advance before the c pawn is captured.",
        "56... Ke3 57. Rg8 Ne4+ 58. Kc4 Kf4": "Kf3 allows an easier draw with 59. Rf8  and 60. Kd4 (59...Ke3 obviously accomplishes nothing)",
        "59. Rf8+ Kg4 60. Rd8": "White's first missed draw. Kd4 or Kd3 should have been the only drawing moves. Kd4 is easier, as after 60...Nd6 61. Rg8  Kf4 62. Rxg3 the white king will capture the c pawn and after 60...Ng5 61. Ke3 the king can stop the g pawn and the c pawn will pose no problem.",
        "60... g2 61. Rd1": "Forced.",
        "61... Kf3": "My first missed win. Winning is 61...Nd2 , with something to the effect of 62. Kb4 (Kc5 allows 63...g1=Q ) Nf1 63. Rd7 (or similar) Ng3 64. Rd1 Kh3 65. Rg1 Nf5 66. Kc5 Ne7 and now when the rook sacrifices itself the c pawn is safe. Other variations include the rook not being able to sacrifice itself.",
        "62. Kd4": "White's second missed draw. 62. Rg1 Kf2 (62...c5 63. Kd5, 64. Rxg2 , and 65. Kxe4; 62...knight moves 63. Kc5 and the king will be able to capture the pawn; 62...Kg3 63. Kd4 Kf3 64. Rxg2 Kxg2 65. Kxe4=) 63. Ra1 g1=Q (63...knight move 64. Kc5 and both pawns will be captured; 63...c5 and the rook can move along the first rank while black can do nothing, if the pawn promotes Kd5 finishes the draw; black king moves don't help) 64. Rxg1 Kxg1 65. Kd4 and 66. Kc5",
        "62... c5+": "Ng3 is probably an easier win; after 63...Nf1 (63. Rg1 Kf2 or 63. Rd3  accomplish nothing) black's rook can't stop the pawn.",
        "63. Kc4": "Ke5 is no better.",
        "63... Ke2": "My second missed win. 63...Nd2  and 64...Nf1 and black's rook can't stop the pawn.",
        "64. Ra1 Nd2+": "Hoping for 65. Kxc5?? Nb3 .",
        "65. Kc3 Nf1": "Could have offered a draw here.",
        "66. Ra2+": "Draw agreed. An interesting case of knight pawns vs. rook."
