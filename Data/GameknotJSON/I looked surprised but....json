        "1. d4": "Watch me being laid low by a well-planned attack on the king!",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nc3": "Not the most common move, but perfectly playable.",
        "2... d5 3. Bg5 Nbd7": "I have a feeling that wasn't a common move either. But I was planning to fianchetto my light-squared bishop and this move seemed fine.",
        "4. Nf3 e6 5. e4 dxe4 6. Nxe4": "I can already see the shadows of an attack gathering. But as yet there is nothing I can't easily defend against.",
        "6... Be7 7. Bxf6 Nxf6 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Nfg5": "My opponent is clearly coming in for an attack. Obviously 9...Nxf6 will make me lose a pawn, so I try to prevent that.",
        "9... h6 10. Nxf6+ Bxf6 11. Nh7": "I can see that this isn't looking OK for Black any more. But I am still confident.",
        "11... Re8 12. Qg4": "I could at the time see 2 options. One was to blunt the queen's attack line with 12...g6, and after 13.Nxf6 Qxf6 White has no attack left. Or I could have played a \"waiting move\" - I had 12...Bd7 in mind - and Black's position is sound.",
        "12... g6 13. Bxg6": "Ah. Perhaps I should have gone for the waiting move. White's queen has an unobstructed attack line, so I decided to take the bishop, which would give me a win IF White's attack failed.",
        "13... fxg6 14. Qxg6+ Kh8": "My only move.",
        "15. Nxf6": "Let's face it, checkmate is inevitable in a maximum of 2 moves. I just want to hang on as long as possible.",
        "15... Re7 16. Qxh6+ Rh7 17. Qxh7#": "Congratulations to you, mrvroom - you thought that attack out really well."
