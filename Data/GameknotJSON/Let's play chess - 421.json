        "7. Qe2": "?",
        "7... Bxd4 8. Qd2 Qf6 9. f3 Bxc3": "Alternative is ...e5.\n\nBlack has his bishop in a fantastic position. Pushing the black pawn onto e5 solidifies makes blacks centre stronger aswell as allowing more space for the white squared bishop.",
        "10. Qxc3 Qxc3+ 11. bxc3": "White now has doubled pawns to contend with. A future weakness for Black to target.",
        "11... Nd7 12. Ne2 Nb6 13. Bb3": "Restricting the Black Knight and saving the Bishop.",
        "13... a5 14. a4 Bd7 15. O-O Rad8 16. Ng3 g6": "The Black knight cant come any further forward unless the pawn vacates e4.",
        "17. Rfe1 h5 18. Ne2 h4 19. h3 g5 20. Nd4 Rfe8 21. Kh2 f6": "Black is playing a little risky pushing the pawns in front of his king. ",
        "22. Ne2 d5 23. Nd4": "White has moved the knight 4 times in his last six moves. ",
        "23... c5 24. Nb5 Bxb5 25. axb5 c4": "A brilliant Move. The Bishop is locked out of the game.",
        "26. Ba4 dxe4 27. Rxe4 e5 28. Ree1": "Black has a winning advantage. Black can never lose control of the d file as if a rook ever comes to d1 black captures it, after white recaptures black takes the bishop. There is then a serious threat of both of blacks rooks winding up on the second rank and attacking the King. \n\nA hard fought game between these two players. Good game."
