        "15. a3": "I do not think that this move is necessary at this moment. White should continue to focus on the center and on the Kingside. Every tempo is crucial in the Sicilian Najdorf.\n",
        "15... a4 16. Nd2 Ra5": "An interesting choice. 16...Bc6 and 16...Rc8 are some other choices.\n",
        "17. Be3": "A possibility for Black if she wants a dynamic game would be 17...d5 18. Bxb6 Qxb6 19. exd5 Nxd5 20. Nce4\n",
        "17... d5 18. Bxb6 Qxb6 19. exd5 Nxd5": "So far as expected.\n",
        "20. Nxd5": "I am not crazy about this move. I prefer 20. Nce4 to maintain pressure on the Kingside. Then the Knight on d2 can go to c4. Now Black has a comfortable position.\n",
