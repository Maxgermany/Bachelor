    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "one of the most interesting games i've played, it explodes into life on move 15... from then on it's crazy...",
        "1... c5": "sicilian... we all know this opening....",
        "2. Nf3": "go through the motions...",
        "2... d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. c3": "my preferred line... i get bored on regular sicilian, and slip into casual mode... this makes things a little more open for me if he accepts the gambit...",
        "4... d3": "declined... and i hate it when i'm forced to develop my bishop to d3 instead of c4...",
        "5. Bxd3 Nf6 6. O-O Nc6 7. h3 e6 8. Qe2 Be7 9. Rd1": "excellent... rook on d file before he's castled...",
        "9... O-O 10. e5": "and the attack begins... i always look to play e5 as early as possible, especially if i have succeded in getting my rook onto the d file before black has castled...",
        "10... Nd5 11. exd6": "! ",
        "11... Bf6": "indeed... 11... Bxd6? 12. Bxh7 ! Kh8 (not Kxh7 or Ng5  gets messy) 13. c4 and the knight or bishop falls, reclaiming the material, and his kingside penetrated... or if 11... Qxd6? 12. c4 and the knight is pinned to the queen since the bishop can move with check... my opponent left a message with this move which said something like \"VERY reluctant move...\"",
        "12. c4 Ndb4 13. Be4 Bd7 14. a3 Na6": "and here we are... move 15... if anyone correctly guesses my move, then i will be impressed... ",
        "15. b4": "!? i have absolutely no idea if this move really is as sound as it turned out to be for me... it was a mistake, i hadn't noticed the pawn was pinned, i'm not going to pretend it was all a trap... but from here on it's an all out assault...",
        "15... Bxa1": "black gleefully accepts the mistake",
        "16. Bxh7+": "! not as good a move as i first thought, but still sound... ",
        "16... Kh8": "16... Kxh7 17. Ng5  Kg6 18. Qg4 and black is in deep trouble...  and then if black chose 17... Kg8 18. Qh5 would win queen or mate... note how black's bishop is out of position after taking the rook... had he declined, then Ng5 would not be safe and black would be able to safely claim the aggressive bishop...",
        "17. Ng5": "build up the attack and protect the bishop... ",
        "17... g6": "no surprises, stops me playing Qh5... when i first analysed 16. Bxf7 ! my intention from here was to play 18. Bb2  Bxb2 19. Qxb2 ... but i overlooked 19... e5, which saves for black... i assumed f6 was forced... so i had to abandon ship and find another attack, and quickly...!",
        "18. Nxf7+": "! i was going to lose a piece anyway after f6, so why not sac the piece instead...!",
        "18... Rxf7 19. Bxg6": "and, though i'm still down heavily, his kingside is destroyed, he's about to lose a rook, and there's still the small matter of the knights, just waiting to be attacked... not to mention my awkwardly placed passed pawn...",
        "19... Rg7": "not really much else... moving off the seventh rank would lose...",
        "20. Qh5+ Kg8 21. Bh6": "and there falls the rook",
        "21... Qf6 22. Bxg7 Qxg7 23. b5": "it doesn't matter he can attack the bishop and save, even if i moved the bishop, he'd move a  knight...",
        "23... Ne5": "i agonised over this for a long time... i seriously looked into Qh7 , but i just couldn't see how i could make it work for me... i wanted the queens off the board so i could get on with advancing the pawns, my only hope...",
        "24. bxa6": "! the problem with Qh7  was that black would then come out of the exchange with a tempo, and had he played b6 before i could take the pawn, my c pawn is blocked from advancing... this way, i come out of the exchange with one more passed pawn...",
        "24... Qxg6": "! wise... after 24... Nxg6 25. axb7 Rb8 26. Qf3 and i have a protected pawn on the seventh with another pawn close behind to back it up...",
        "25. Qxg6+": "this surprised my opponent... he though i would want to avoid the queen trade, since i am down material... i felt the less pieces on the board, the more chance i have of holding him off and pushing my pawns... also, it was crucial that i kept the initiative so i could claim his b-pawn.",
        "25... Nxg6 26. axb7": "and that's why i traded... c4 is now a passed pawn...",
        "26... Rb8 27. c5": "strengthen my pawn on d6...",
        "27... Rxb7 28. Rc1": "threatening c6, winning a piece...",
        "28... Bc6": "sensible... blocks the pawn and points at g2...",
        "29. Nd2": "discovered attack with late development...",
        "29... Bb2": "not the strongest of moves, but black obviously did not see the danger ahead...",
        "30. Rb1": "! saves the pawn...",
        "30... Bxa3": "? ...but unfortunately black doesn't realise it... the losing move... there was much more chess to be played, i have absolutely no idea who would've won the endgame had black played a safer move than this one... if anyone feels like analysing it, please feel free and share with me your findings...! personally, i felt Bd4 was stronger, i'd have had to return my rook to c1...",
        "31. Rxb7": "and the reason a3 should've been safe...",
        "31... Bxb7": "what else is there? 31... Bxc5 32. Rc7 and black has lost a bishop and rook for two pawns, and still has the kingside pawns to contend with... anything else and i get away with a whole rook...",
        "32. d7": "black resigns... now the error of Bxa3 is clear... his bishops are fatally out of position... black cannot stop promotion... maybe if it were my last pawn that promoted, he might've tried holding out for the draw, but this is an easy win now... with his king out in the open, his pieces are just begging to be picked off by the agile queen... and even if he did manage to hold off the queen, i'd just advance another pawn until he breaks... \n\nso... a question i hope someone can answer for me...\n\nshould 15. b4 be a ?, !, or a ?! move...? i have no idea if it was a good move or a bad move... i just know it turned this game on its head... hope you enjoyed the game."
