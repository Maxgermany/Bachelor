    "moves": {
        "1. e4": "My opponent chose a very drawish opening variation, not blaming him I use it frequently too... but he over reached and tried to push for an impossible win, eventually lost his focus and and allowed me to drive the game in to a won technical endgame.",
        "1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "Ruy Lopez",
        "3... Nf6 4. O-O Nxe4": "main line d4",
        "5. d4 Nd6 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. dxe5 Nf5 8. Qxd8+ Kxd8 9. h3": "diverging from main lines to try avoiding drawish Rd1+ sequences, h3 supports a future g4 push, to improve my king side pawn majority...",
        "9... Be6 10. g4": "now if Ne7, I have Ng5 hitting the e6 bishop known to be by far the best minor piece in this kind of structures",
        "10... Ne7 11. Ng5": "the idea is to exchange N by B, but black still has a lot of defensive resources, this is a very solid and technical variation in the Ruy Lopez...",
        "11... h5": "I shouldn't bother with this, it opens the h column but then what can black do with it, my king and my rooks will control any infiltration squares after an hypothetical and almost certain future Kg2",
        "12. Nd2": "... so I develop further, it temporarily blocks the bishop but allows c3 at any time if needed",
        "12... hxg4": "expected",
        "13. Nxe6+": "no further delay let's exchange with a zwichenzug",
        "13... fxe6 14. hxg4": "and get the pawn back",
        "14... Nd5 15. Ne4": "the bishop is again free to move",
        "15... Be7": "black still has the better bishop but he still hasn't solved the problem of connecting his rooks...",
        "16. Kg2": "and now the long planed Kg2 controls the infiltration squares for the rook on the h column ",
        "16... Kd7": "...surely to connect rooks... is my opponent reading my notes?",
        "17. c4": "now I gain space, the idea is to block black's queen pawns back and then try to infiltrate on the opposed wing to so some damage, progressing laterally on to the other wing to profit from the space advantage (this all far in the future strategy, let's see If my opponent allows this to happen)",
        "17... Nb6 18. b3": "forced, but within the planed strategy",
        "18... Raf8": "no problem there the king on g2 does miracles controlling black's rooks on the open and semi-open columns ",
        "19. Be3": "adding a defender to the f2 pawn to free knight and rook from defending it, plus I also connect my rooks with two options Rad1 or Rh1 to exchange rooks",
        "19... Ke8 20. Ng5": "threatening e6 and offers the exchange of bishop by knight",
        "20... Rh6": "black decides not to exchange, he will try to hold the position with the remaining pieces",
        "21. Nf3": "headed to d4, with tempo to hit e6 on the other side",
        "21... Rh7 22. Nd4": "and here it is, now black doesn't have Rh6 any more, so the e pawn is lost, unless he defends it with the king",
        "22... Rh4": "? allows me to create a passed pawn and loses the c7 pawn for nothing, as my king is controlling black's g pawn progression to promotion, now I shall win this game",
        "23. Nxe6 Rxg4+ 24. Kh3 Rh4+ 25. Kg3": "and black doesn't have any more checks",
        "25... Rg8 26. f4": "gains space, defends e5 and block's the 4th rank to black rooks, of course I expect Rgh8 at any time seeking counterplay on the h column",
        "26... g6": "black seeks also some elbow space to ensure some maneuverability",
        "27. Rad1": "occupies the open d column and prevents Kd7",
        "27... Rgh8": "here it is",
        "28. Nxc7+": "and now black can trap my knight on c7 but he can't force the capture, at least not without giving back some material compensation...",
        "28... Kf7 29. e6+ Kf8 30. Kf3 Nc8 31. c5 b6 32. b4 Rh4h2 33. Rf2 Rh8h3+ 34. Ke4": "centralizing the king were the action is bound to happen...",
        "34... Rxf2": "black is overreaching he had better chances for a draw if he avoided exchanges..., the idea must be to reach the other wing pawns for some counter-play, but this disregards his own king's wing defense",
        "35. Bxf2 Rh2": "I was expecting either Ra3 or Rc3 to both of which I would have replied with Bd4 to control g7 and threatening mate in h8, now I just don't see the point of 34...Rxf2 after this move by black...",
        "36. Bd4": "Rh2 is just pointless if he want the a pawn lets see him grab it!",
        "36... Rh4 37. Be5": "secures the f pawn and threatens Bd6",
        "37... g5 38. Rd7": "now I'll force some exchanges to simplify the endgame",
        "38... bxc5 39. bxc5 gxf4 40. Bd6 Nxd6+": "not forced but black had nothing better",
        "41. cxd6 f3+": "still playing out the game in disbelieve I think...",
        "42. Kxf3 Rh7 43. Rxe7": "the pragmatic approach, entering a technical won endgame that denies black any counter-play by exchanging his last pieces and profiting from my more advanced pawn and remaining piece to force the promotion",
        "43... Rxe7 44. dxe7+ Kxe7 45. Ke4": "and now I'll bring the king to defend the e pawn and if needed next I'll block the a pawn and force black to move his c pawn releasing d5 for a check with my knight pushing e7 next followed by Nf6 to secure the promotion square, but I expect my opponent to resign soon"
