        "2... c5": "He is after the centre squares i think. ",
        "3. Nf3": "I will bring out my Knight.  ",
        "3... Nc6": "I was wondering if he would do that or d6.  I personally think this is better.",
        "4. Bc4": "I will bring out my bishop attacking f7, attacking centre of the board and enabling a castling option.",
        "4... Nf6": "With this lay out i always tend to look at d3 for extra back up for e4 and it also opens up the diagonal for my black bishop.  The trouble is it stops my white bishop from retreating in sight of any danger.  ",
        "5. O-O": "Instead i chose to castle to leave me more options.",
        "5... d6": "Obviously to defend pawns and open or his Bishops diagonal.",
        "6. a3": "I will deal with that later but first I will give my bishop an extra square.",
        "6... a6": "assuming he is lining up an attack of my bishop (b5).  But now I have both a2 and b3 to retreat i will..... ",
        "7. d3": "....stregnthen my e4 pawn and open up the bishops diagonal.",
        "7... Rb8": "Whats he up to now? ",
        "8. Bg5": "Knight on f6 is annoying me because of d5 square i am going to get rid.",
        "8... Be7": "Fair enough although I am not sure whether I would have tried to get the queen out to try and attack (if i did bishop for knight).  Altough option now for a castle.",
        "9. Bxf6": "any way as I said lets get rid. ",
        "9... Bxf6": "ok but now I have the square I dont know what to do with it. ",
        "10. Bd5": "Lets try this. attacks Knight stopping the movement of b7 pawn whilst still attacking f7 although I guess a castle is coming. ",
        "10... Qb6": "b2 under attack ",
        "11. Rb1": "lets defend",
        "11... Qc7": "I guess just change of plan",
        "12. h3": "unsure what to do here so I thought i would open an escape for my king ready for the end game.",
        "12... Bxh3": "I should have saw that i tend to think people dont like losing bishops for pawns but this splits my defence wide open.",
        "13. gxh3": "but hey I got the bishop anyway.  Now to defend my king.",
        "13... Ne7": "Now he is trying to get to my king.",
        "14. Re1": "I am going to try and drag my king to the other side of the board.",
        "14... Qd7": "I see he is after my lone h3 pawn although i have noticed he has left his queen and king on the same diagonal.  If only I could find a way to pin him.  Doubt it but lets see.   ",
        "15. h4": "First I will delay the capture although I should have moved my king and let him take it as now I realise if he still moves to h3 my king is trapped.  I was trying to stop him moving his queen but lets see what happens.",
        "15... Qh3": "knew it",
        "16. Re3": "I am going to have to attack the queen now",
        "16... Nxd5": "I smell something fishy but what.  Why would he give me his knight it doesnt make sense I cant see the difference it makes to my defence situation.  perhaps he is trying to tempt me into taking the knight to then try for his bishop so when he takes my knight with g7 pawn the g File is open for his rook.   (after annotation and discussion I realised I was completely oblivious to the fact he actually took my bishop here) ",
        "17. Nxd5": "But as I cant spot it I will take it.",
        "17... Bxh4": "I thought here if I take the bishop I will force him to take take my knight and that nothing will be acheived",
        "18. Nxe5": "So I took this pawn knowing he couldn't take my knight and he would now have to move his queen.   ",
        "18... Qc8": "Queen retreated",
        "19. Qg4": "I am offering queen for queen because of my king being vulnerable and this also gives me the bishop for knight option if he refuse and i may also capture a vulnerable pawn.",
        "19... Qxg4+": "ok queen for......",
        "20. Nxg4": "....queen",
        "20... O-O": "castling obvious move I suppose ",
        "21. Rh3": "This will move his bishop (I think) and attack the h7 pawn.",
        "21... g5": "thats why I said I think (git)",
        "22. Nh6+": "I considered many options here but considered if he attacks my knight with Kg7 I could fork his bishop and sacrifice my knight and pawn",
        "22... Kg7": "I got it then",
        "23. Nf5+": "check",
        "23... Kg6 24. Nxh4+": "bishop for....",
        "24... gxh4": "knight for....",
        "25. Rxh4": "pawn",
        "25... f5": "Not sure why he done this but I have my eye on rook for rook now. ",
        "26. exf5+": "Take that its check.  Take with the rook and I will fork with Knight.  Take with the king and I will pin rook on rf4 and get rook on for rook.",
        "26... Kg5": "ok",
        "27. Rxh7": "pawn for pawn then instead.",
        "27... Rxf5": "attacking knight",
        "28. c4": "I considered other moves this blocks his pawn and protects knight till i want to use it.  I couldnt find much more on.",
        "28... b5": "well i cant take it",
        "29. Nc7": "so lets try for your pawn",
        "29... b4": "ok",
        "30. axb4": "I will take this one then what ever he he chooses to take it with I will go for a6 as well ",
        "30... cxb4 31. Nxa6": "as I said",
        "31... Rb6": "I see",
        "32. Ra1": "I am going to protect my Knight not move it as if he doesnt move b4 - b3 i will move b2-b3 then ra1- r-a4",
        "32... Kf4": "hmm he can check me now better be careful ",
        "33. b3": "but kets carry on not much damage can be done yet",
        "33... Kf3": "destination e2",
        "34. Kf1": "better move but i know if he can get his rook to the 1 rank it could be mate.  Cross that bridge when it comes to it",
        "34... Rg5": "I couldnt see why till submit",
        "35. Ra4": "I was trying to be careful but he will go rg2 and i will have to go back to a2 and possibly end up losing my knight",
        "35... d5": "ok but now I have an idea",
        "36. Rf7+": "check - g4 I will take b4 then plot my escape and mate.",
        "36... Kg4": "Kg4",
        "37. Nxb4": "Nxb4",
        "37... Rh6": "ok i can see the h1 check but its too late now.  What good will it do.",
        "38. Nxd5": "I will take his last pawn then head for c3",
        "38... Kh3": "???",
        "39. Ne3": "I want to move c4 at some point to trap his king",
        "39... Kh2": "right",
        "40. Ke2": "time to move",
        "40... Rg1": "I still do not know what he is up to but I spy a fork on g4.  Heres hoping.",
        "41. c5": "I would have moved my king but want him to attack b3 pawn to rid his rook and take the fork.",
        "41... Rb1": "He did it",
        "42. Ng4+": "Gotcha.",
        "42... Kg2 43. Nxh6": "Thank you.  Now for the Checkmate. With both rooks on g and h File.",
