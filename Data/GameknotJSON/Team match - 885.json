        "2. d4 d5 3. e5 c5": "Main line advance so far.",
        "4. dxc5": "This is questionable as it dosnt cause black as many problems as the main line, which continues 4:c3 Nc6 5:Nf3 Qb6. This holds the pawn centre and the game will be black trying to break it down and white trying to defend it. Best play usually results in an equal game.",
        "4... Bxc5 5. Qd3": "Not an extremely useful move. Moves like Bd3, Nf3 would be good, developing and aiming to castle.",
        "5... Nc6 6. Nc3": "White thinks that black can't capture on e5, but he hasnt seen far enough.",
        "6... Nxe5 7. Qb5+ Nd7": "Black defends everything and is a pawn up.",
        "8. Qe2 Ngf6": "Now black is well on top, with better development and an extra pawn.",
        "9. Bg5 O-O 10. a3": "White is still making unnecessary moves. White should be trying to get castled.",
        "10... Qb6": "More devlopment and threatening a pawn.",
        "11. Na4": "This is the final straw. With so many wasted tempi, it is no surprise that black can finish the game.",
        "11... Qa5+ 12. Nc3 d4": "Winning a piece as b4 is answered by Bxb4."
