        "1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. d5 b5 4. cxb5 a6 5. b6": "This move is just as good as 5. bxa6.  Psychologically, I always found it difficult to be on the black side of this.\n",
        "5... Qxb6 6. Nc3": "Prepares e4.\n",
        "6... d6 7. Nf3": "This will transpose to the same line as e4.\n",
        "7... Nbd7 8. Rb1": "e4 and Qc2 were also playable here.\n",
        "8... Bb7": "Computer analysis prefered g6 on the last couple of moves.\n",
        "9. e4 g6 10. Bc4": "Slightly better than Be2 or Bf4 as white prepares for a possible e5.\n",
        "10... Bg7 11. O-O a5": "Castling would have been slightly better.\n",
        "12. b3": "Qe2, Qc2, Bd2 and Re1 were also good.\n",
        "12... Ba6": "Black ignores castling, but it is not going to hurt him yet.\n",
        "13. Na4": "There are a lot of other good moves here like Bb2, Qc2, Qe2, and Nd2.  White has a slight edge.\n",
        "13... Qb7": "Or Qa7.\n",
        "14. Bb2": "Prepares e5.\n",
        "14... Bxc4": "Helps White.\n",
        "15. bxc4 Qc7 16. Nc3 O-O 17. Nb5": "White has a strong advantage with a lot of choices here.  Re1 is just as good.\n",
        "17... Qc8": "It would be easier to defend e5 with Qb8, although Black has to then be aware of any potential attack on the file.\n",
        "18. Qe2": "White actually lost here by overstepping the time control.  What follows is computer analysis on how the game could have continued.\n",
        "18... Nh5 19. g3 Bxb2 20. Rxb2 Rb8 21. Rfb1 a4 22. Nd2 Rb6 23. Na7 Qc7 24. Rb2xb6 Nxb6 25. Nb5 Qb8 26. f4 Ng7 27. Nf3 Qb7 28. e5 Nd7": "28... dxe5 29. Nxe5 [Is winning for white.]\n",
        "29. exd6 exd6 30. Nd2 Re8 31. Qd3 Qb8 32. Ne4": "White is clearly winning.\n"
