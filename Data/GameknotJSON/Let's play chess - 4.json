        "1. d4": "a nice game where i exploit whites light squared weaknesses",
        "1... Nf6 2. Nf3 e6 3. c4 b6": "Queens Indian defence",
        "4. e3 Bb7 5. Nbd2 Nc6 6. Qc2 Be7 7. a3": "embarking on a plan of queenside expansion, prehaps prematurely",
        "7... O-O 8. b4": "continuing said plan",
        "8... d5": "best way to counter play on the wings? play in the centre of course!",
        "9. e4": "?? mistake loses a pawn for white, prehaps b5 continuing the plan of queenside expansion is better, else white should play a developing move such as Bb2",
        "9... dxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4": "white not only lost a pawn, but a centre pawn and blacks position now looks much better as his pieces are better developed and in an open position such as this development is very important.",
        "12. Nc3": "only move to aviod further material loss",
        "12... c5": "fighting for space on the queenside",
        "13. Be3": "developing with tempo. obviously not bxc5 when black achieves everything he could possibly want after Bxc5, whites queenside pawns are very weak and blacks bishops are deadly.",
        "13... Qe5": "logical, maintaining the pin on the knight and creating a pin on the bishop on a central square the queen cannot be driven from",
        "14. Bd3": "an interesting pawn sac, probably the best practical chance",
        "14... Rad8": "refusing the sac as after 14...Bxg2 15.Rg1 white gets an attack going against my kingside. probably not worth the 2 pawns but i'd rather not have to weather the storm, i've got a winning material advantage anyway, i'd rather just have the task of converting it.",
        "15. O-O Bd6": "Forcing white to weaken the light squares around his king, which my light square bishop is in the perfect position to exploit",
        "16. g3": "forced",
        "16... Bb8": "reopening the rooks line of attack, but Bc7 is the better retreat as it would help in my fight for the d file in some lines later in the game",
        "17. Rad1": "logical, opposing my rook on the d file",
        "17... Rxd3": "removing whites light squared bishop and thus further weakening his white squares",
        "18. Qxd3": "Rxd3 with the idea of tripling on the d file is prehaps stronger as white keeps a major piece on the 2nd rank",
        "18... Qh5": "closing in on the light square weaknesses around the king, threating to come in on both h3 and f3",
        "19. Rd2": "?? this natural looking move is suprisingly fatal, now white loses his king or his queen. f5 avoids immediate disaster but the white king can definately feel the draft. after f5 the game would still be very much in the balance with both sides fighting for an edge. this is where it becomes obvious that the bishop is better placed on c7 as whites main asset would be his control of the d file and on c7 the dark squared bishop influences d8 allowing the rook to compete for the open file",
        "19... Qf3": "crushing, physically preventing whites intended f5 when he would be ok",
        "20. Nd5": "best, but it is only delaying the inevitable",
        "20... Nxd5": "best capture, taking with the pawn allows white to force the queens off when white will be down 2 pieces and two pawns for a rook but will have active prospects thanks to his control of the d file. although the game is still very much blacks to lose. taking with the bishop is obviously wrong as black will lose his best piece",
        "21. Bxc5": "?? the final nail in his kings coffin, black can now force mate. 21.cxd5 Bxd5 22.Qxd5 exd5 is the only way to avoid losing the king. Rfd1 is met by Nf4 with mate next move",
        "21... Qg2+": "the queen sacrifices herself to insure the enemy kings death",
        "22. Kxg2": "Forced",
        "22... Nf4+": "Double check, forcing the king to move to the one square not attacked by a black piece",
        "23. Kg1 Nh3#": "and mate.  beautiful finish if i do say so myself"
