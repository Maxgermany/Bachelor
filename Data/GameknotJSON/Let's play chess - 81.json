        "4... Bg7 5. Nc3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Qb3 Nxc3 8. Qxc3 b6 9. Be2 Bb7 10. b4 Nc6 11. Bb2 e6 12. O-O Ne7 13. a3 Rc8 14. Rfd1 Nd5 15. Qd2": "Now that both White and Black are fully developed, I think Black is a little better here.  The Nd5 is strong and their are possibilities to dislodge White's d4 pawn.",
        "15... Qe7 16. Rab1 Rfd8 17. Qe1 Nf6": "I was surprised by this move, considering the strength of the Nd5.  Here it eventually leads just to an exchange.",
        "18. Nd2 Ne4 19. Nxe4 Bxe4 20. Bd3 Bb7": "I think Black is still a little better here because the Bishops have better diagonals.",
        "21. Bf1 c5": "This is the critical moment.  Black tries to break up White's center and take the initiative.",
        "22. dxc5 Rxd1 23. Qxd1 Bxb2": "I was expecting Rd8 here, to force my Q off the open file.",
        "24. Rxb2 bxc5 25. bxc5 Rxc5": "This allows White a tactic to remove the defender and win a piece.",
        "26. Rxb7 Qxb7 27. Qd8+ Kg7": "Only move.",
        "28. Qd4+": "White will win the R back and be up a full piece.  Black resigned here.  I think Black had the better of things positionally, but just missed a tactic."
