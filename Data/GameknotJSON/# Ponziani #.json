        "1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. c3": "Ponziani opening, not very a popular opening at high levels, because of diminished expectation regarding white's advantage.",
        "3... d5": "The battle for the center. If i don't take exd5 then i lose pawn, if i defend it with d3 pawn, then d5xe4 and if take it with d3xe4   Qxd1  Kxd1 i'll be forced to echange queens lose tempos and cannot castle, and the game is pretty much in Black Hands.  \r\n\r\nSo instead, the only good move i see is counter attack with Bb5",
        "4. Bb5 dxe4": "Black plays the tempting dxe4",
        "5. Bxc6+": "check",
        "5... bxc6 6. Nxe5": "pretty much even position. \r\nBlack should watch out for the c6 square",
        "6... Qg5": "Black is Aggressive, attacks both knight on e5 and g2 pawn.\r\nThere is no good defense for white in this position without losing value, that is why black played this way",
        "7. Qa4": "Qa4! But i didn't say anything about counterattack  ...\r\nBesides Attacking c6 im also attack e4 two valuables pawns for Black\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Qxe5 then Qc6  forking king and rook, following next move i take rook.\r\nknight for a rook & pawn while opening black king defenses is not good choice.\r\n\r\nIf Qxg2 I again reply with Qc6 \r\n",
        "7... Bd7": "Bd7 not a bad move.",
        "8. Qxe4": "Qxe4 threat for uncovered check next move",
        "8... Nf6": "Nf6 is a good defensive while developing black knight",
        "9. Qe2": "I retreat to e2 to keep the uncover check, and to make sure black does not castle because of my Qa6 move.  ",
        "9... O-O-O": "0-0-0 is a bad move Black should have played Be7 to protect against uncovered check. yet Black plans were probably to pin my Queen on e-file",
        "10. O-O": "I castle to make sure my king is well defended",
        "10... Bh3": "Black hopes for the mate, but yet another mistake because blacks own king is exposed.",
        "11. Qa6+ Kb8 12. Nxc6+": "and next move is mate Qa7#\r\n\r\nWithout black mistakes, White had other opportunities to gain momentum and would have taken more moves to win this game.\r\n\r\nCan you guess the turning point of this game?\r\n\r\n7. Qa4"
