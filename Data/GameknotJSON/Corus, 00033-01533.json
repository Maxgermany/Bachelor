        "1. e4": "With Sergey you always get some kind of critical position that you have never seen and he has very well prepared.\" - From Corus 2010 site, annotated by Shirov. \r\n\r\nthis is attached in my blog http://red-white-chess.blogspot.com",
        "1... c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Bb5": "\"White shouldn't get an opening advantage like this; with Nf3 it is a little better.\" \n",
        "3... Nd4 4. Bc4 e6 5. Nge2 Nf6 6. O-O a6 7. d3 b5 8. Bb3 Nxb3 9. axb3 Bb7 10. f4": "\"We were following Tiviakov-Kotronias, where Kotronias played the very strong 10.Ng3 d6 11.f4 h5! and went on to win.\"  \n",
        "10... d5 11. e5 d4 12. exf6 dxc3 13. fxg7 Bxg7 14. bxc3 Rg8 15. Rf2 Bxc3": "\"Sergey played very quickly, so I realized I was in his preparation. I believe Black has enough compensation with the pair of bishops. But when I saw 15...Qd5 16.Qf1 Bf6 17.f5 Bh4 18.Ng3 Bxg3 19.hxg3 Rxg3 20.Bf4 I couldn't believe my eyes, because Black is actually worse because of his development. In the end I decided to get my pawn back anyway.  \n",
        "16. Nxc3 Qd4 17. Kf1 Qxc3 18. Ra2": "\"We were still in his preparation and maybe I was too optimistic. If my attack doesn't succeed, I will have problems with my pawn structure; so I'm still fighting for equality.\" \n",
        "18... Qd4 19. Qh5 c4": "\"At first I thought about 19...O-O-O . After 20.Bb2! Qd5 21.Qxd5 Rxd5 22.Be5 it is a drawn position, but White is slightly better. Then I remembered I had the same kind of endgame with White yesterday and I did not like the idea of suffering like Caruana did.\"  \n",
        "20. bxc4 bxc4 21. Ra4 Bd5 22. f5 e5 23. Qxh7": "\"Sergey played this very quickly and falls for the trap that I had set with 19...c4. He should have gone 23.Qh6 and Black should consolidate with Kd7 \"  \n",
        "23... Kd7": "\"Now Sergey thought for a long time; he had probably missed the idea of Bxg2.\" \n",
        "24. Qh6 Bxg2+ 25. Ke1": "\"25.Rxg2 could be a good quiz for amateurs! Black wins with 25.Rxg2 Rxg2 26.Kxg2 Rg8+ 27.Kf3 e4+ 28.dxe4 Qd1+ 29.Kf2 Qg1+ 30.Kf3 Qf1+ 31.Ke3 Qxc1+ \"  \n",
        "25... Bd5 26. Ba3": "\"The best defense is 26.Rf1 , but Black should be winning after Rg1 \"  \n",
        "26... Rg1+ 27. Ke2 Qg4+ 28. Ke3 Re1+ 29. Kd2 Qd1+ 30. Kc3 Qa1+ 31. Kb4 Rb1+": "Shirov was aked if he could explain his variance in results at super tournaments: \"Sometimes I am well prepared and sometimes I am not.\" Asked if that meant he is well prepared for Corus Chess 2010: \"I didn't say that! It is too early to tell.\" Shirov was awarded the IJmond Veelzijdig prize of 500 euro for his victory. \n"
