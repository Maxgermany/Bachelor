        "9. h3 Bxf3 10. gxf3": "Here white doubles his pawns.  Qxnf3 MIGHT have been better, except black ought to consider Qb4+ and have his pick of QxNa4 or QxBc4.  White could block the check with Nc3, leaving black white's white bishop.",

        "16. f3": "Holy s**t this was a horrible move!  NOW what stops QxQa4?  Free queen!",
        "16... Qxe3": "???  Yes, there was a free bishop.  But there was a FREE QUEEN!  This is like stooping to pick up a shiny copper penny when just a few feet away a twenty dollar bill rests.",
        "17. Qxc6+": "Ok, that is NOT a free pawn.  I might have considered Qe4+, forcing a queen exchange here.",
